    "title": "Revised: Web3 Training and Recruitment Center in Decentraland",
    "body": "> by 0x8d61957962ac11ecb570d5b2c809129f7fd92328\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe strive to create a training and recruitment hub in Decentraland. With the Open Metaverses evolving, there’s a need to educate talent to obtain first-hand Metaverse experiences. With an educational hub in Decentraland, EkoLance will bring together talented people and companies to foster collaboration and thus true adoption of Decentraland’s vision by eventually onboarding millions of students globally to Decentraland.\n\nEkoLance makes the blockchain space easily accessible to millions of people from emerging countries by offering free training on specific blockchain professions and connections to employers.\n\nOur goal is to enable 50.000 people to work in Web3 by the end of 2023. Decentraland will be the first entry point to our ecosystem.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n30,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x8d61957962aC11ecB570D5B2C809129F7Fd92328\n\n## Email address\n\nmaria.eneva-olms@ekolance.io\n\n## Description\n\nAfter the initial feedback on the 1. version of the grant, we made changes to reflect the feedback.\n\nEkoLance www.ekolance.io is a training and recruitment platform that helps professionals start working in web3.\n\nIt has two core functions:\n\n*   Cohort-based Training Programs to train professionals to work in specific web3 professions such as content creators, community managers, blockchain developers\n\n*   Recruitment function, where companies can select from the talent pool and hire\n\n### Free training programs for people from emerging countries\n\nEkoLance focuses on educational inclusion for people from emerging economies. We offer our training programs for free to people from emerging countries (currently from Africa and Southeast Asia), who otherwise cannot afford blockchain education. We connect them to employers with whom they would otherwise not have any touchpoints. This is how we foster educational and financial inclusion.\n\nWe have educated more than 650 people in the past 6 months and 30% of them were hired directly after our training. More than 2000 people have subscribed for training and recruitment with us. Currently in our talent pool we have:\n\n*   250+ Solidity Developers\n*   700+ Content Creators\n*   550+ Community Managers\n\n### Strong Partnerships in the Web3 Space\n\nEkoLance currently has 8 sourcing partners with a total community of over 20.000 people from which we regularly get talented professionals to subscribe to our training programs. We partner with universities, Blockchain, and Tech Hubs, which promote our training programs and services to their members.\n\n### We cooperate with corporates, who train and recruit from our talent pool\n\nWe invite blockchain professionals to train our talents, so they have the most up-to-date and practical training experience possible. Companies, which have participated in our training programmes are: Ankr, Blockdaemon, Blocksize Capital, Pillar Foundation, HER DAO, Metagamehub DAO, ReCheck, AuditOne, Quantstamp, Basenode.io, YieldGuildGames, Luna Vision, BeInCrypto.\n\nCompanies, which have recruited from our talent pool are: Quantstamp, Micobo, ReCheck, O2k.tech, Getonboard.gg.\n\n### Benefits for Decentraland\n\nWith Ekolance in Decentraland, we will have the first training and recruitment center in the Metaverse, bringing together companies and talents from all sectors to the Metaverse. This center will offer innovative opportunities for talents to get trained to work for Web3 companies and become part of the communities as well as for companies to recruit the right talent for them. This will provide proper and retentive user engagement via true utilities which are constantly pushed via weekly initiatives such as educational trainings, events, quests, job matching, socializing and more taking place on top of the LANDs. Decentraland community members also benefit from direct access to talents, who are familiar with Decentraland and are trained to work in the Metaverse apart from the user and adoption growth this provides. Since most of the trainees will have zero to little experience with web3 before this, it will serve as a major boost for adoption and to onboard the masses to Decentraland and thus foster mainstream adoption.\n\nFurthermore, it will allow Decentraland to position itself as the entry point and “home” for everyone’s Metaverse journey and strongly place itself at the center of metaverse adoption via a strong focus on education - something that is often neglected in the web3 space.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOur first installment is going to be a minimal experience on 2 LANDs, that already covers the basic structure for a good learning experience and job placement:\n\n*   an info reception / welcome area\n*   a learning board and video screens with learning material covering several topics\n*   guided learning - incentivized by a proper engagement model, NFT certificates, and other rewards\n*   live training sessions\n*   partner placement\n*   job board\n*   search dashboard for employers\n\nThe experience will consist of a building with several different areas serving the above purposes on different floors.\n\nWe will implement a learning board that is connected to a server backend serving dynamic course content. This includes creating a web interface for managing the learning contents. The learning board is meant to be used for self-studying. Its contents will grow over time - initially, it will cover basics around Community Management, Web3 Content Creation and Solidity Development. Further learning content can be streamed as video on screens inside the Ekolance building.\nThe solution we are implementing could also be used by other educational content creators in Decentraland.\n\nFor guided learning, we will be implementing an engagement model that incentivizes and supports the learning progress of the students with a specialized UI showing course progress, learning milestones, course certificates (users gain POAP certificates as proof for attending a course), and further information.\n\nLive training sessions will be held over a video stream in regular intervals. Contents of the live training sessions will be added to the learning board contents.\n\nFinally, there will be an area for partner placement including a job board, with additional screens that partners can use for presenting.\n\nEmployers will be able to browse and search through available talents and check their on-chain certification, and be able to directly contact them.\n\nThis grant is meant to cover the costs of developing a basic technical infrastructure for the above learning experience. It will be the foundation for further development.\n\nIn future steps, we plan to drive knowledge transfer between students by a more sophisticated engagement model and will improve the overall learning experience by refining course material and the underlying UI. Organizing information in a 3D space yields many possibilities that need to be explored for optimal education.\n\n### Ekolance Grant Event\n\nWe are hosting an event in Decentraland this Thursday, December 15, 4pm CET with one of our partners (MetaGameHub DAO). We’re introducing Ekolance to the Decentraland community and we’re going to do a live training about hosting and development for an event in Decentraland. Be sure to come visit us there!\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n### MetaGameHub DAO\n\n*   Backend Developer (Content Server)\n*   Frontend/UI Developer (Learning Board and Guided Learning Logic)\n*   Modeller & Scene Builder\n\nMetaGameHub DAO has a pool of experienced developers and modelers with expert knowledge about the Decentraland SDK and the overall process of developing and modelling for Decentraland (most notably DCL-Edit).\nHere’s a link to a the currently active experiences that were developed by MetaGameHub DAO:\n\n*   https://play.decentraland.org/?realm=artemis\\&position=-62%2C45\\&island=I61lm\n*   https://play.decentraland.org/?realm=artemis\\&position=-4%2C-60\\&island=I61lm\n*   https://play.decentraland.org/?realm=artemis\\&position=65%2C-49\\&island=I61lm\n\n### EkoLance\n\n*   Content Manager\n*   Project Manager\n    Maria Eneva-Olms (https://www.linkedin.com/in/menevaolms/), Founder at EkoLance. EkoLance has conducted 6 training programmes with 20+ blockchain professionals as trainers and content creators resulting in the education of 650+ professionals to work in the web3 space in the past 7 months.\n\nWe expect full-time effort for the backend and frontend developers. Content Management will most probably take a bigger portion of the overall effort as well. Modeling / Scene building is expected to take considerably less time.\n\nNote that $5K of the $30K are meant for covering the cost for the land acquisition (2 Lands).\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### February 2023 - Prototype\n\n*   Prototype building with a learning board covering a first topic: Decentraland Development\n\n*   Backend prototype server with interface for course content management\n\n*   Video walls with tutorials on different topics such as Tokenomics (https://www.ekolance.io/youtubelive) , Game Development (content will be created), Solidity Development (https://www.ekolance.io/solidity-developer-training), Web3 Content Creation (https://www.ekolance.io/blockchain-content-creator-training), Web3 Community Manager Training (https://www.ekolance.io/blockchaincommunitymanagertraining), Smart Contract Auditor Training (content will be created)\n\n*   First live events: live training sessions on screen, Networking, After-parties to socialize\n\n*   NPCs handing out POAP certificates for courses\n\n### March 2023 - Improvements + Guided Learning\n\n*   Basic version of guided learning measures: basic UI showing learning categories, lessons, and progress through the courses\n*   More learning content\n*   Further development of learning board and backend server\n\n### April 2023 - Finalizing\n\n*   Reception and info-center\n*   New area for partner placement and job boards\n*   More lessons, more courses for further topics\n*   Final building\n*   Polish, Testing and QA\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=85b77c60-7c61-11ed-ad27-015f26e7c35c)**",

    "title": "Should The Foundation or the DAO Host a \"Welcome to Decentraland\" Onboarding Event",
    "body": "> by 0x7bbea9c18cd0541acab8c19da2b11d0c03faef1c (1Existence)\n\nShould The Foundation or The DAO host a \"Welcome to Decentraland\" onboarding event?\n\nWe have done and continue to do big events with big names meant to bring people into Decentraland.  Before the MVMF 2022 the discussion amongst the residents of DCL was about doing what they could do to retain those that came for the event. (It would be nice to see if there are some sort of results somewhere on that but not what this is about.) No matter who funds it this will ultimately require a large number of those currently in DCL to help make this a success.\n\nWhat do I mean by \"Welcome to Decentraland?\" This is meant to be an onboarding event on a large scale. When DCL was first constructed The Foundation had to find a way to draw people into DCL.  I propose we have an event similar in some ways to what they did (at this time I am not sure what all occurred) and new ideas to make this an exciting event that will have people coming back.  I'm imagining Devs and Coders hosting some building classes.  Wearable and Emote creators hosting some, wearable and emote classes as well.  DJ's hosting some music classes.  Streamers hosting some streaming classes.  Gamers hosting Gaming classes.  I hope you got the idea now.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nBuilding Decentraland - a 5 day course where you will be shown how to construct a (Insert a structure that can be done in that amount of time).  Each day a new topic with Q\\&A showing new and current users how they can create builds within DCL.  By the end of the 5 days they will have hopefully created their first building.\\\nThe same with the wearables and emotes.  DJ's can show other musicians how to DJ in the metaverse, how to promote themselves and at the end of the 5 days, they perform for us.  I would love to see 2 - 1hr courses maybe each day to accommodate different time zones.\n\nWe would work closely together and make sure that DCL Brasil and Arabia, Germany, China etc are included and have courses for them.  Perhaps language courses as well.\nSomething like Canessa mentioned in the CBD Space today Dec. 14, a greeting in different languages with  arrows and instructions directing them to a location in the Plaza with the events in their language.  We'd have a few people in the Plaza to help answer questions.\n\nThis would be a workshop of sorts and could also lead to ideas of events for a future convention.  There could be prizes for the best new builder or wearable creator etc. If we show them they can build IT, they will come and now because they know how, they will stay.\n\nDid I mention that hopefully people would donate their time to help make this a success for those new to DCL and for ourselves. All would equal land sales, wearable sales, more events.  A budget and possibly a committee to put this together would have to be made but with all of us pitching in we can keep the costs down to a minimum.  Fun had by all and best of all, We Build a Better World, Together!\n\nI thank you for taking the time to read this and please feel free to ask questions, I don't have all the answers but maybe someone else will know what I do not.  I appreciate all constructive criticism and welcome it.\n\n1Existence\n\n- YES, ABSOLUTELY \n- NO, FORGET IT\n- I NEED MORE INFO\n- I JUST DONT CARE\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1bd9cab0-7bf7-11ed-ad27-015f26e7c35c)**",

    "title": "Continued Enhancement of Decentraland VR Clients - Resubmission",
    "body": "> by 0x9a739c2e212754c3d8432cb717dc9437e5b3dfae (Sean#dfae)\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nIn this proposal resubmission, the team behind Decentraland’s VR client is seeking a grant for continued development and expansion of VR support for Decentraland. We submitted a grant proposal on November 8, 2022, which did not meet the voting threshold. We received constructive feedback in the proposal’s forum discussion. Based on the feedback received, the team has resubmitted the grant proposal and incorporated the community requests. Project details are provided in the description and specification sections of this proposal. The team is honored to be considered for a DAO grant for the continued development of Decentraland VR.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x6340676C1604186893Ab14521fDFc1C81AF07161\n\n## Email address\n\nsean@onginnovations.com\n\n## Description\n\n### Background\n\nIn May 2022, the community voted to approve a [Decentraland DAO grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8fe0e0a0-d62b-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0) that expanded the scope of the DAO-funded Decentraland VR client. The VR client was ported to run natively on the Meta Quest, a significant technical milestone that made Decentraland’s codebase Android compatible.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/wcO6pccF7qaJvEgRhl/giphy-downsized-large.gif)\n\nThe team brought the PCVR and Quest VR clients to parity with the web/desktop versions of Decentraland by bringing all screen UI and pop-ups into VR and made in-game interactions work with the VR controllers.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/Zve6MHsVpafIDDine1/giphy-downsized-large.gif)\n\nThe VR client team also made stability improvements, implemented a new VR user interface, and made heavy strides towards squashing bugs and incompatibilities related to the Android headset conversion. For the final deliverable of the previous grant, the team published Decentraland VR to the SideQuest store, which can be downloaded at: (https://sidequestvr.com/app/11626)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GdxH4ggl.png)\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/hSZwZkQeStWXoPv1gB/giphy-downsized-large.gif)\n\nIn this grant proposal, the VR client team seeks to continue maintaining, enhancing features, and improving the performance of the Decentraland VR clients over the next 6 months.\n\n### Summary of proposed work\n\nA summary of proposed activities is provided in this section, with additional details in the specification section of this proposal.\n\n*   **New Minimum Viable Experience approach:** Shout out to Yemel for this item! Our team agrees with [community feedback](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-dba1365-continued-enhancement-of-decentraland-vr-clients/16537/7?u=mr0ng) from our previous grant proposal that rearchitecting the current Decentraland VR client may be in the best interest for the long term success and efficiency of the project. Our proposed approach is outlined in the specifications section.\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/wdki9fal.png)\n*   **Feature enhancements:** The team proposes to add several VR enhancements, including hand tracking, more natural avatar movements for VR and VRM avatar support, and enhancements on the VR user interface. VRM support is also in response to this [DAO proposal that passed](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bdafe1c0-1d6b-11ed-96c7-2fa07c6df25b) by Morph.\n    ![](https://vrm.dev/en/\\_images/alicia_scene2.png)\n*   **Maintenance and Stability:** The team will continue to maintain the VR client over the next 6 months, fixing any breaking issues that may occur and keeping the VR client in sync with any changes from the main Decentraland branches. The team is committed to improving the performance and reliability of the VR client. This includes increasing frame rate and reducing crashes and other bugs.\n*   **Marketing, PR and Social Media, store submissions:** Shout out to Gino for this item! Per [community feedback received on our previous grant proposal](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-dba1365-continued-enhancement-of-decentraland-vr-clients/16537/6?u=mr0ng), we’re dedicating a portion of the grant budget towards Marketing and PR for raising awareness of Decentraland VR. We will also push the client to more stores in order to bring Decentraland to a wider audience.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### New Minimum Viable Experience Refactor\n\nThe team agrees with the [approach proposed by Yemel](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-dba1365-continued-enhancement-of-decentraland-vr-clients/16537/7?u=mr0ng) that we need to start building a dedicated Decentraland VR client from the ground up. This is in contrast to the current approach, which is a VR port of the existing Decentraland client. In order to maintain continuity and keep a version of Decentraland VR available to the community, we propose to work on this MVE refactor in parallel to maintaining and enhancing the current VR client. This is because any work done towards the current VR client such as hand tracking or VRM support (and more) can also be used on the new MVE.\n\n### VR Feature Enhancements\n\nThe team proposes to add several VR enhancements, including hand tracking, [VRM Avatar support](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bdafe1c0-1d6b-11ed-96c7-2fa07c6df25b), and enhancements on the VR user interface. The VR client will still maintain controller support. The hand-tracking update will not replace controller support, but will be an alternative way to interact within Decentraland VR. We will also look at enhancing the avatar movements to leverage expanded movement in VR. For example, waving hands, limb movements (crouching), and more avatar movements that follows the user’s physical movement. We will expand upon the VR UI implement during the previous grant to make it easier to access quick actions like emotes, mic settings, and teleportation to parcels.\n\n### Maintenance and Stability\n\nThe team will continue to maintain the Decentraland client for the duration of this grant period (6 months), fixing any breaking issues that may occur and keeping the VR client in sync with any changes from the main Decentraland branches. This includes increasing frame rate and reducing crashes and other bugs.\n\nThe largest component of this category will be to convert Decentraland existing asset bundle system (currently only set up for the web client / WebGL) and make it android-compatible for the standalone VR clients. This will result in a major improvement in frame rate, memory usage, and overall stability of the VR client because the asset bundles are more optimized than loading in the GLTF models directly.\n\nWe also propose to set up a CI/CD pipeline for the VR client and implement a synchronized release schedule with the primary Decentraland client.\nWe will seek to automate this process as much as possible to reduce future manual maintenance needs.\n\n### Marketing, PR and Social Media, store submissions\n\nPer [community feedback received on our previous grant proposal](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-dba1365-continued-enhancement-of-decentraland-vr-clients/16537/6?u=mr0ng), we’re dedicating a portion of the grant budget towards Marketing and PR for raising awareness of Decentraland VR. This will involve regular social media posting, video and tutorial publications, blog posts, interviews, press releases and other dissemination methods. We will also push the VR client to more stores to reach a wider audience. This includes being published first to Meta’s AppLabs store, and then to its full store which will make Decentraland VR available to an estimated 15-20 million players and vastly lower the technical hurdles to get it installed. We will also look to publish Decentraland VR to the SteamVR store.\n\n### High level budget breakdown\n\n![Budget](https://i.imgur.com/b21JBUI.png)\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe items outlined in this grant proposal will be managed and completed by the Ong Innovations team and our associated partners.\n\n### The team comprises\n\nSean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n\nClint Campbell (XR developer)\n\nPaul Gumpert (XR developer)\n\nClinton Reddie (XR Developer and Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nVeeRuby (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nAppVolks LLC (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\n### Additional information on our company, team members, and partners can be found in the links below\n\nhttps://www.xrdevstudio.com/\n\nhttps://www.veeruby.com/\n\nhttps://www.appvolks.com/\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe team will report progress to the Decentraland community on an ongoing basis and will monitor the project's forum closely for questions or to provide updates as needed.

    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[DAO Grants Program - Budgeting System](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b2626480-75b0-11ed-bc92-ef497b387215)\n\n## Summary\n\nDefine a budgeting strategy for the DAO’s Grant Program in order to secure the good standing of the treasury and long-term operations of the DAO.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Decentraland DAO has been granted a  [10-year vesting contract](https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac)  worth 222M MANA starting on Feb 19, 2020. The MANA in this contract vests every second, thus gradually increasing the size of the DAO’s fund, at a rate of 1.8M MANA per month. Also, the DAO has its own revenue streams such as marketplace fees and wearable curation fees.\n\nThis proposal defines a strategy to limit the maximum amount of funds that can be allocated quarterly via the Grant Program.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO’s grant program is one of the best vehicles to help grow the Decentraland ecosystem. However, at this moment there is no general consensus about how much the DAO should be investing in this program.\n\nBy  [reviewing the results of more than one-year operations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DjeIf5hXON6jOWagaTj\\_3M2rCm7wa-mrt9bqUE8pfLc/edit?usp=sharing) , *the total budget allocated* since the beginning of the grant program can be calculated:\n\n*   Platform Contributor 35%\t= $2,584,100 USD\n*   Gaming  26%\t= $1,887,500 USD\n*   Community  21%\t= $1,558,400 USD\n*   Content Creator 18%\t= $1,346,809 USD\n\nAlternatively, the results can be displayed in these categories (aligned with the proposed  [new categorization of grants](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fec954c0-75ae-11ed-bc92-ef497b387215) ):\n\n*   In World Content    \t49%\t= $3,545,400 USD\n*   Platform    \t\t21%\t= $1,585,169 USD\n*   Core Unit    \t\t7%\t= $520,200 USD\n*   Sponsorship    \t9%\t= $687,500 USD\n*   Documentation    \t3%\t= $193,800 USD\n*   Social Media Content\t4%\t= $282,240 USD\n*   Accelerator    \t\t7%\t= $487,500 USD\n\nThe DAO needs to agree on how much should be spent and implement a control mechanism to ensure there is no overspending. This will secure the long-standing operations of the DAO.\n\nIt’s also necessary to agree on the distribution of the funds over different categories of projects. This will prevent allocating 95% of the funds to one category and not leaving space for other important initiatives. The DAO should agree on a diversification strategy and revisit it periodically.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Grant Program will be divided into four periods (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4). At the beginning of each quarter the maximum amount of money that can be allocated through the Grants Program will be defined using the formula:\n\n*5,500,000 \\* MANA_PRICE \\* 0.7*\n\nThis means the DAO at maximum capacity will be spending 70% of the MANA received from the vesting contract. For example, using $0.39 as the  [current MANA price](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decentraland/) , the total budget for the quarter will be $1,501,500 USD.\n\nAlso the DAO should set a desired distribution of funds on the different grant categories. Define the maximum amount of funds that can be allocated to a particular activity and when that number is reached, it won’t be possible to request more grants of that category until the start of the next quarter.\n\nBelow is the proposed distribution for the first quarter, including the quarter budgets using the previous example of a MANA price of $0.39:\n\n*   Platform \t\t40% \t= $600,600 USD (per quarter)\n*   In-World Content \t20% \t= $300,300 USD\n*   Core Unit \t\t15%\t= $225,225 USD\n*   Sponsorship \t\t10%\t= $150,150 USD\n*   Accelerator \t\t7%\t= $75,075 USD\n*   Social Media Content 5%\t= $75,075 USD\n*   Documentation \t3%\t= $45,045 USD\n\n![budget distribution](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/decentraland/original/3X/c/b/cb4a009b32ddaccd80977da92f494b256a3e9cb7.png)\n\nThe DAO can change this distribution in the future via a Governance Proposal or by implementing an alternative voting mechanism such as *weighted voting*.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe proposed changes to the vesting contract will have the following impact:\n\n*   Calculate a total budget per category to spend at the beginning of each Quarter.\n*   No more grant requests will be accepted for a category that already reached its budget.\n*   The DAO will be able to change the percentage to spend (70%) and budget distribution for the next Q via a binding proposal.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe Governance Squad will implement the following changes:\n\n*   Update Decentraland documentation.\n*   Display the total budget for the quarter and for each category.\n*   Invalid the submission of grants for categories exceeding the budget.\n\nThese changes are all feasible and can be developed in one or two weeks. The DAO Committee will ensure to don’t exceed the quarterly and categories budgets, effective since January 1st, 2023.\n\nAny community member can send a governance proposal to change the overall budget and distribution for the next quarter. Eventually, this could become a binding proposal without the need to go from Poll > Draft > Governance.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe DAO has an income of 1.8M MANA every month and it should set up a limit control to not spend more than 70% of such a stream. This will mitigate the risk of running out of funds in the next 7 years.\n\nThe DAO should agree on limits for each category, so that the funds are distributed based on a targeted strategy. This will encourage initiatives in underfunded categories.\n\nThe DAO refreshes and recalculates the category budgets using the MANA price at the beginning of each quarter. It’s possible that many grant requests will be submitted when such limits are refreshed, looking to secure their budget before it’s allocated to other initiatives. This could be beneficial for the DAO, encouraging competition and ultimately leveling up the bar.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bfab7b70-7b75-11ed-ad27-015f26e7c35c)**",

A  [community vote](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b265e3e0-bcb0-11eb-a871-a927ffd81f49)  approved the current categories, more than a year ago, and now is a good time to review the results and propose improvements.\n\nBy  [reviewing the results of one-year operations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QM7pHOcR9yUdJstdudcoHi9qKXwj\\_6Q9rDY89wjHU0k/edit?usp=sharing) , some conclusions can be drawn:\n\n*   The Grant Program has allocated funds to a diversity of projects.\n*   The current categories are too broad and sometimes misused.\n*   Each category should have clear requirements and impact measurements.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nEvery active grant must:\n\n*   Comply with Decentraland’s Content Policy,  Terms of Use, and  Code of Ethics.\n*   Provide monthly updates on the Governance dApp.\n*   Provide a presentation in a video format to be shared publicly.\n*   Be responsive to DAO Committee and Core Unit communications.\n*   Be ready to summarize how the grant funds were used every month.\n\nThe proposed categories are:\n\n**1- Core Unit**\n\nProvide core infrastructure and operations for the DAO. The work done is essential for the organization and grantees may be considered official representatives of the DAO.\n\n*   Requirements:\n    *   Provide an essential or strategic value to the DAO.\n    *   Build in the public, publishing open source code and documentation.\n    *   Define their own performance metrics.\n\n**2- Platform**\nCreation of tools and applications that extend the power of the Decentraland platform or provide alternative ways to explore Decentraland’s ecosystem.\n\n*   Requirements:\n    *   Build in the public, publishing open source code and documentation.\n*   Performance Metrics:\n    *   The number of contributions made to the main repository of code.\n    *   Publish the tool or application to production and provide usage metrics.\n\n**3- Documentation**\nCreation of free educational content about how to contribute, build and play on Decentraland. The content should be published on official mediums to be found and preserved for posterity.\n\n*   Requirements:\n    *   The topic shouldn’t be already well-covered in the official documentation.\n    *   Provide examples of documentation done in the past.\n    *   Describe the format of documentation to be produced.\n    *   To be published in official mediums.\n*   Performance Metrics:\n    *   The number of contributions to Decentraland Documentation\n    *   The number of contributions to the Awesome Repository.\n\n**4- In-World Content**\nDevelopment of attractive experiences in Decentraland that generate retention of users. The experiences can be in the form of scenes, games, and events, in any case, consumed by players through the reference client.\n\n*   Requirements:\n    *   Deploy content or host events in Decentraland.\n*   Performance Metrics:\n    *   Newley populated land, Active Users, Returning Users, Time on Scene.\n    *   Events created and # of attendees to the event.\n\n**5- Social Media Content**\nProjects to create content on social media platforms such as Twitch, Twitter, Youtube, Tik Tok, and Discord. The project aims to reach new users and keep them engaged.\n\n*   Requirements:\n    *   Explain audience size and relevancy to Decentraland.\n*   Performance Metrics:\n    *   Number of pieces to be produced\n    *   Total of views and interactions of the created content.\n    *   Engagement metrics (likes, retweets, reach, retention)\n    *   Mentions in other media outlets.\n\n**6- Sponsorship**\nSupporting conferences, side events, community meetups, hackathons, and contest prices that target audiences relevant to Decentraland.\n\n*   Requirements:\n    *   The event is happening IRL or online but outside of Decentraland.\n    *   Ensure Decentraland DAO brand awareness during the event.\n*   Performance Metrics:\n    *   Number of attendees and level of brand awareness.\n    *   Evidence of the project execution (photos, videos, publications).\n    *   Mentions in media outlets.\n\n**7- Accelerator**\nA private company or revenue-generating initiative looking forward to receiving an investment from the DAO.\n\n*   Requirement:\n    *   Revenue share with the DAO or alternative value proposition.\n*   Performance Metrics:\n    *   Returns of Investment.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe proposed changes to the vesting contract will have the following impact:\n\n*   Formalize good practices expected from grantees.\n*   Include in the grant application form a section for detailing a budget.\n*   Include in the grant application form a question for each category requirement,\n*   Grant vesting can be stopped based on low-performance metrics.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe Governance Squad should implement the following changes:\n\n*   Update Decentraland documentation with detailed requirements.\n*   Update the grant submission form to reflect new questions for each category.\n*   Update the grant submission form to request information about the budget.\n*   Update the grant submission form to improve personnel and roadmap questions.\n\nThese changes are all feasible and can be developed in one or two weeks.\n\nThe Grant Support Squad should be responsible for measuring performance metrics for each grant and overviewing its roadmap progress. A grant should be revoked if such performance metrics are poor or fails to meet any of the requirements.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal redefines the previous four categories into a new set of seven categories, each of them with a clear scope, requirements, and key performance indicators to measure its impact.\n\nThe application form to request a grant should make the requester acknowledge the requirements for the grant category. Grants that do not pass the requirements or are badly categorized should be rejected by community vote.\n\nIt’s important for the community and the grantee to agree on the goal of the project and the performance metrics that will be used to measure the impact of the project. Failing to demonstrate results on these performance metrics may result in revoking the grant funding.\n\nHaving well-defined categories is a prerequisite for doing proper budgeting, based on these categories the DAO will be able to vote on how to allocate the resources to each category.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=77475620-7b74-11ed-ad27-015f26e7c35c)**",

    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[DAO Grants Program - New Vesting Contract](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=10b93a80-75ad-11ed-bc92-ef497b387215)\n\n## Summary\n\nRedesign the smart contract used to allocate funds to projects supported via the Grants Program.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe DAO is currently using a *linear vesting* contract to pay grantees. This proposal aims to replace the current second-by-second schedule with a regular 30-day payment scheme.\n\nThe new vesting contract should also allow the DAO to preemptively pause the vesting contract, to later decide to resume it or revoke it.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO’s grant program is one of the best vehicles to help grow the Decentraland ecosystem. Since the inception of Decentraland, linear vesting contracts have been used to distribute funds.\n\nA typical *linear vesting* schedule has a month *cliff*, in which no funds are accessible, and after day 30 the payment for the elapsed month is made available. The rest of the funds are released second by second until the end of the contract.\nThe linear vesting model is a simple and elegant method to distribute funds over time, however, it might be too optimistic and generate some caveats around the revocation process.\n\nNowadays, when a project doesn’t report any progress for a while or the reported progress is not related to the project roadmap, the DAO committee proceeds to a *preemptive revocation*. It is the best course of action to protect the DAO’s treasury.\n\nThe concept of preemptive revocation strikes really badly on grantees and the general morale in the community. Implementing a new vesting schedule and a mechanism to pause/resume the vesting can ease a lot the process of overviewing grant-funded projects.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe new vesting schedule should follow a step function, where compensation is made available in chunks over periods of time. This means the beneficiary is paid in arrears; they are paid for a working period AFTER the work is done.\n\nThe Grant Program should standardize payment contracts with 30 days periods and equal payment amounts for each period. Different amounts per month could be defined for non-standard situations after the review of the DAO Committee.\n\nThe vesting contract should be always initialized on the 1st day or the 15th day of the month, this will give some time of preparation to the grantee between the votation finishes and the work starts. This will also order projects over time and synchronize updates made by grantees through the Governance dApp at the end of half of the month.\n\nThe new vesting contract should include the capacity to pause and resume the vesting schedule. This can be used to warn the grantee in case of any concerns about the project status/health For example, in case a grantee didn’t report progress after 30 days, the contract should be paused. If the project reports progress short after, the vesting can be resumed without delays in the schedule. Otherwise, the vesting contract should be revoked and later recreated if necessary.\n\nThe operations of pause, resume and revoke can only be performed by the DAO through the DAO Committee.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe proposed changes to the vesting contract will have the following impact:\n\n*   Allow the grantee to pick the starting date of the project (1st or 15th).\n*   Grantees will receive payments every 30 days from the starting date.\n*   Improve the operations of monitoring grant projects.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe dApps Team from Decentraland Foundation had already implemented the following changes:\n\n*   Develop a new vesting contract.\n*   Conduct external security auditing of the contract.\n*   Update the vesting deployer tool.\n*   Update the vesting viewer page.\n\nThese tools have been already implemented by Decentraland Foundation. They made sure to include all the DAO needs in the new implementation. The code changes are  [ready](https://github.com/decentraland/vestings-builder)  and  [4 audits](https://github.com/decentraland/vestings-builder)  have been completed.\n\nThe DAO Committee can start using the new implementation of vesting contracts immediately.\n\nThe Governance Squad should update the grant submission form to allow the selection of the starting date. Such change can be developed in one or two weeks.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA new vesting schedule of constant periods of 30 days it’s an easy model to understand and better protects the DAO’s treasury.\n\nIt removes the anxiety of overviewing projects that are not reporting progress but still continue to vest funds every day. It pays for the work done and not while it’s being performed.\n\nThe capacity to pause and resume it later adds an extra layer of security, setting expectations to grantees about making a public update of their progress every month, otherwise, the vesting contract will be preemptively paused. In case they show up with progress, the vesting is resumed quite easily. Otherwise, the contract can be revoked and recreated with a new schedule if necessary.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=71987090-7b71-11ed-ad27-015f26e7c35c)**",

    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[DAO Grants Program - New Tiers & VP Threshold](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=69b1fb50-75ac-11ed-bc92-ef497b387215)\n\n## Summary\n\nRedefine the tiers of the DAO’s Grant Program, making it more flexible and secure.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nCurrently the grants program allow the following Tiers:\n\n*   **Tier 1:** Up to $1500 USD in MANA (1M VP + 7 days) - One Time Payment\n*   **Tier 2:** Up to $3000 USD in MANA (1M VP + 7 days) - One Time Payment\n*   **Tier 3:** Up to $5000 USD in MANA (1M VP + 7 days) - 3 Months Vesting\n*   **Tier 4:** Up to $60,000 USD (2M VP + 14 days) - 6 Months Vesting\n*   **Tier 5:** Up to $120,000 USD (4M VP + 14 days) - 6 Months Vesting\n*   **Tier 6:** Up to $240,000 USD (8M VP + 14 days) - 6 Months Vesting\n\nThis proposal simplifies all six categories and redefines the VP threshold required to access such grants. It also makes it more flexible by allowing the grantee to define the duration of the project and the payable currency (MANA vs stablecoins).\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO’s grant program is one of the best vehicles to help grow the Decentraland ecosystem. The current tiers structure was approved by a  [community vote](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b265e3e0-bcb0-11eb-a871-a927ffd81f49)   almost a year ago, and now is a good time to review the results and propose improvements.\n\nBy  [reviewing the results of one year operations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VAVGZYbhV98hHxc2M39d-6XqeVG8ov2kvS9Yaxp0TyY/edit?usp=sharing) , some conclusions can be drawn:\n\n*   The tiers 1, 2, 3 represent 2.5% of the money granted.\n*   Tier 6 represents ~60% of the money granted, with an acceptance rate of 27%.\n*   The tier 4 is the most easily approved one, with an acceptance rate of 45%.\n*   Voters generally abstain from expressing their decision if the current result is aligned with their preference and the threshold has been achieved.\n*   Grantees almost always request the maximum budget allowed in the tier.\n*   Many projects requested funds for a scope longer than 6 months.\n*   The VP involved on grants has steadily increased over time, and it’s likely that only highly contentious grants get voted on by more voting power.\n\nFor this revised version of the Grants Program, the following changes are proposed:\n\n*   Adjust the minimum VP threshold required to pass a small-tier grant.\n\n*   Make the VP threshold variable based on the requested amount; the more money you need, the more VP is needed.\n\n*   Allow more flexible vesting schedules to support different kinds of projects (longer and shorter than 6 months).\n\n\n## Specification\n\nA new scheme of two tiers is recommended:\n\n**Lower Tier:**\n\n*   Up to $20,000 USD, payable in stablecoins or MANA using a Vesting Contract, or a one-time payment (after 30 days).\n*   Vesting duration can range from 1 to 6 months.\n*   Votation period: 2 weeks.\n*   Votation threshold: 2M VP.\n\n**Higher Tier:**\n\n*   From $20,000 to $240,000 USD, payable in stablecoins using a Vesting Contract.\n*   Vesting duration can range from 3 to 12 months.\n*   Votation Period: 2 weeks.\n*   Variable votation threshold, using the formula:  [1.2M + TOTAL_BUDGET \\* 40VP/USD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VAVGZYbhV98hHxc2M39d-6XqeVG8ov2kvS9Yaxp0TyY/edit#gid=146607161) .\n    *   E.g. $60,000 USD requires 3,600,000 VP\n    *   E.g. $120,000 USD requires 6,000,000 VP\n    *   E.g. $240,000 USD requires 10,800,000 VP\n\n![image1](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/decentraland/original/3X/2/4/247e6a14d8465bd5cbda4c404c3fe8c9c6ba3594.png)\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe proposed changes to the tiers scheme will have the following impact:\n\n*   Simplify the grant program into only 2 tiers.\n*   Increase budget for one-time payments up to 20k in MANA or USD.\n*   Allow flexible project roadmaps (shorter/longer than 6 months).\n*   Incentivize conscious budgeting by raising the VP threshold based on $$.\n*   Increase the minimum VP threshold required to pass a grant.\n\nThere are two parameters of this model that could be easily changed over time in contrast to the current tiers system, allowing for more flexibility and a quicker iteration of this structure over time as participating VP increases. Those are:\n\n*   The 2M threshold on the lower tier\n*   The slope of the threshold on the higher tier (currently set to 40 VP per USD requested)\n\nParticipation over time could be monitored and changes in these parameters could be proposed in a future governance proposal.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe Governance Squad should implement the following changes:\n\n*   Update Decentraland documentation.\n*   Display and validate new thresholds based on budget.\n*   Update the grant submission form to reflect new options.\n\nThese changes are all feasible and can be developed in one or two weeks.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed change aims to adjust the required VP thresholds, aligning them with current standards of participation in the DAO.\n\nMaking the VP threshold variable based on the requested amount will encourage the grantees to be more mindful of their budgets.\n\nAlso, removing the limitation of 6-month vesting and allowing grantees to define the duration of the project would make it possible to fund short-term goals such as conference sponsorships and IRL gatherings; and also year-long initiatives that are considered core to the operations of the DAO.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=853092a0-7b70-11ed-ad27-015f26e7c35c)**",

    "body": "> by 0x40e021b3fc43705ba2db1c0c985cd4457e3729eb (DiVerge)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nDiverge is a Metaverse fashion brand and ecosystem that creates high-end wearables for virtual realities. Check the presentation to find more of what we already did in DCL!\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1EClpBmFD3KxCiqzDk580k6upt_V2KzxJ/view?usp=sharing\n\nDue to the huge number of different wearables in the marketplace, finding a perfect total look could be confusing. With the grant Diverge will develop and create an interactive game where everyone can get fashion advice, win wearables and create a total look for their avatar in a fun and easy way.\n\nDiverge will host fashion shows and educational events to choose your way of self-identification and attract more new users to the DCL ecosystem.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x40e021B3Fc43705bA2DB1c0c985cd4457e3729eb\n\n## Email address\n\ndina@diverge.me\n\n## Description\n\nBusiness goal: To increase space retention with interactive gaming experiences and engaging fashion events.\n\nConcept:\nDiverge is asking for your vote to help fund its idea to solve the styling problem and create the AI Style Expert (fashion game) and host fashion workshops and fashion events.\n\nIdea:\n\n1.  to create an AI Stylist slot machine, to get a styling advice and win wearables\n2.  to host fashion shows to increase awareness for the designers and creators\n3.  to create an educational MetaFashion space in DCL with regular workshops and events and to invite fashion and crypto experts.\n\nAI STYLIST\nThe idea of the game comes from the decision to solve the following problem: it's very confusing and hard to style your avatar due to the huge number of different wearables on the marketplace in DCL. Styling the look may be confusing in IRL, and definitely not easier in Metaverse where there are no limits in choosing your way of self-identification. You can be whatever you want to be, whatever you feel to be in every moment and you can change your character or outfit in seconds. We want to help the community to style their looks in the best way and share our fashion experience.\n\nThe AI Stylist Expert will be open for every DCL member and available at Diverge’s MetaFashion Space (Crystal City location(-1;51)).  Everyone can stop by and receive their wearable prizes and fashion advice!\n\nThe AI Style Expert will work this way:\n\n1.  You choose your gender:\n\n*   Male\n*   Female\n*   Gender neutral\n\n2.  First time you can play for free and have 3 attempts to play. Each attempt you get  advice and you have a chance to win a wearable. After the first free attempt you pay 1 MANA to play more and have more chances. Every attempt you get a different style (totallook) which you can purchase right away. For this we’ll create different wearables ourselves and collaborate with other DCL designers and brands. Also there will be a chance to win a wearable.\n\nEveryone who starts their game with AI Stylist will get an entry role. For example, it can be the “Fashion Addicted” role.\n\nThere will be a leaderboard with the levels on how fashionable you are.\nFashion Addicted is an Entry Role. Fashion Icon is the highest one.\nFor the entry role you have just to play at least once for free.\nFor the Fashion Icon you need to play for example 100 times and have in your Closet minimum 10 total looks from Ai Fashion Expert (can be changed if needed).\n\nMETAFASHION SPACE\nWe’ll take responsibility to enlighten everyone from Web3 to start their Decentraland journey and create social media activities for user adoption. For this we’ll create wearables and emotes and will collaborate with Web3 fashion projects to motivate their community to join the space.\n\nFor the DCL community we’ll host workshops with invited fashion and crypto experts to talk about crucial topics and share their experience. The community will have a chance to win wearables and MANA prizes during our fashion shows. Of course, every event will include proper marketing strategy, invited guests and artists (DJs, influencers).\nWe’re honored to be a part of DCL and have a chance to contribute to the Space!\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAI Stylist Game development – $4180\nAI Stylist design – $3700\nCode/Build – $6820\nProject management – $6000\nContent creation – $3500\nWearables development – $7000\nCommunity manager – $7300\nEvent creation and management – $10000\nFashion experts onboarding – $1500\nPR curator – $3500\nFashion curator – $5000\n\nTotal: $60000\n\nSummary of the operation costs followed by more info:\n\n*   AI Stylist Game development: game logic, leaderboard, auth & mana payments, slot machine animation, fashion advice prize, wearable item drop prize;\n*   3D design, models and paid digital creation tools;\n*   Code/Build: building the MetaFashion space, location of AI Stylist;\n*   Project management: communication, team-building and leading, coordinating, organizing corporate events and meetings on a consistent basis and completing reports;\n*   Content creation: creating a good-quality content for social media and press-releases using additional softwares for the best quality;\n*   Wearables development: hiring designers to create wearables from our moodboards;\n*   Community manager: actively engage with the community on social media, motivate and encourage new people to join Decentraland;\n*   Event creation and management: creating fashion shows and workshops, inviting fashion experts;\n*   Fashion and crypto experts will be invited on our workshops and fashion events to educate the community, share their experience and insights from both web2 and web3 fashion industry;\n*   PR Director: developing and executing an integrated marketing strategy, launching brand marketing projects to grow both Diverge’s and Decentraland’s presence in target media;\n*   Fashion curator: creating the moodboards, doing research to find and develop fashion wearables;\n\nMore detailed specifications https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VFamKC9SUzBJQUOeSnDmAT-qmN1eUX9z4aLw96vHLPU/edit#gid=0\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nDiverge founder\n\nDina Perfilieva\n\nLinkedin  https://www.linkedin.com/in/diana-perfilieva-360b6a16/\n\nTwitter  https://twitter.com/di_uni_verse\nDiscord di.universe#3479\n\nDeveloper\n\nRezon\nTeam Lead of DCL Full Cycle Builders @inceptionfun\n(One-year dev experience in DCL)\n\nco creator. 0xa9F07D4B9FF368851Af454DfFea60A3F7F587eee\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/inceptionfun\ndiscord: @rezon#5280\n\nFashion Curator\n\nOlga Yanul\nInstagram Instagram https://www.instagram.com/olgayanul/\n\nCommunity manager\n\nAsya Sumik\nTwitter https://twitter.com/AsyaSumik\nDiscord\n\nPR Director\n\nAnastasiia Bilous\nInstagram  https://www.instagram.com/nastasiabilous/\n\nStaff to hire:\nProject manager, event manager, 3D designers, content creator.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nRoadmap and milestones:\nMilestone One:\nMain development of the AI Stylist;\nCreation the event plan with user adoption;\nMoodboards for the wearable creation;\nLaunch social media activities to attract new users;\n\nMilestone Two:\nWearables creation and on-boarding Decentraland designers and brands;\nSocial media activities for Web3 user adoption in Decentraland;\nWorkshops with fashion experts;\nFashion events with DJs and influencers;\nAI Stylist implementation;\n\nMilestone Three:\nMetaFashion Space implementation with various fashion activities for the community to win wearables and receive the fashion advice\nFashion shows with wearable and MANA prizes.

This proposal is to extend the Decentraland DAO's Governance Facilitation Team’s term of service for an additional six months, to support operation of the Decentraland DAO.\n\nLink to the team's constitutive grant, which is drawing to a close, can be found [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f8b699c0-e810-11ec-82d9-d917cdd158ac).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n78,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x19f43564A02599DdaE651599aCc03c523a06F4D4\n\n## Email address\n\nmatimio@decentraland.org\n\n## Description\n\nThis proposal is to extend the operations of the DAO Facilitation Squad, for an additional six months. Over the course of its first term, the DAO Facilitation Squad developed a cadence of operations and regular reporting, and identified core areas where our engagement is most useful, this includes but is not limited to:\n\n1.  Hosting of DAO Town Halls, In-World Meet Ups and DAO Facilitation Office Hours;\n2.  Strategic Communications and Reporting on DAO Operations and Governance issues;\n3.  Development of a Formal Working Group Process and Facilitation of Issue-Specific Working Groups;\n4.  Coordination of engagements and collaborations between the Decentraland DAO Community, DAO Core Units, the DAO Committee, and the Decentraland Foundation.\n\nThe operations of the DAO Facilitation Squad are further intended to support the work and community engagement of other “Core Units” of the DAO, which include the [DAO Governance (dApp) Squad](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4772fdb0-74e3-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556) and the [Grants Support Squad](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c5c2f9a0-5fa7-11ed-9e27-9944727da95a).\n\nOur **primary objective over the coming term will be to focus on our DAO’s collective decision-making and consensus building processes.** Many in the web3 space often equate governance to voting. However, over the past months we have seen that voting is often not the end, but the beginning of a divisive issue or debate, and that collective decision-making and consensus building is as, if not more important, than the final outcome of a proposal or poll.\n\nDrawing on leading policy decision-making frameworks, including what is known as the Delphi Method, we will focus on finalizing and implementing a robust working group process that can be led by Community and/or Facilitation Team Members; and further focus on creating and maintaining multiple forums for increasing communication, coordination, and collaboration between the DAO Community, Committee, Core Units and Decentraland Foundation.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis grant will set up a budget to fund operations of the Facilitation Team for a six month period. The grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stable coins assigned to a 2-out-of-3 signatures Multisig. Participants are Matimio (Mathew Markman), Fractilians (Natalie Nunez - both members of the Facilitation Team); and Gino Cingolani (Gino), who is a member of the DAO Governance Squad. Once claimed from the vesting contract, payments will be automated to each team member using [parcel.money](https://parcel.money/).\n\nDuring our first term of operations, the DAO Facilitation Team focused on [Operations](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOeomRcA=/?share_link_id=184697690463) and [Research & Analytics](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOvsEcOM=/?share_link_id=435185352063). We will continue to work in these two areas, however, we have refined our scope, work flow and cadence of deliverables; as well as terminology for the above fields of work.\n\nOperations, will be reclassified as **Strategic Relations** and includes, but is not limited to:\n\nClose coordination with Decentraland Foundation & Grants Support Squad\n\n1.

    "body": "> by 0xdce7d7f3ea933b214b1e73b47b079b631122596e (Metancy)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal is to ask the DAO funding to organize, participate, and list Decentraland as co-organizer of the first Metaverse Architecture Biennale to be held cross-metaverse in Decentraland and ARhead in 1Q-2Q 2023.\n\nBiennale would unite the best creators from all over the world to manifest the significance of architecture and design for the metaverse. During the Biennale two metaverse platforms would showcase bespoke projects and ideas and become a place to speculate about the future of this new environment, meet co-thinkers and formulate the vision of our future!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xDCe7D7F3eA933B214b1E73B47B079b631122596e\n\n## Email address\n\ninfo@metancy.agency\n\n## Description\n\nKEY INFORMATION\n\n50 000+ visitors\nbased on engagement of Decentraland Art Week, Metaverse Festival\nand Metaverse Fashion Week\n\n2 metaverse platforms\nDecentraland & Arhead, providing huge area to explore the Biennale\n\n10+ expositions by headliners\nwell-known architecture & design studios from all over the world\n\n10+ expositions by selected talents\nopen-call for creators to design their own pavilion for the Biennale. The best selected\nprojects would win a grant to build it\n\n5 days of events and lectures\nfrom architecture, design, metaverse & marketing industry leaders\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nWe believe that there is only one decentralized metaverse that unites all of the platforms, technologies and communities. To emphasize this idea we’ve decided to run the event on two platforms simultaneously, in Decentraland a massive neighborhood would be developed specially for this event and from there you could teleport to a new world in\nArhead to explore even more amazing spaces.\n\n*   huge exhibition space in two metaverse platforms: Decentraland and Arhead\n\n*   architectural competition open to creators with any experience\n\n*   more than 20 pavilions by the creators from all over the world\n\n*   expositions by well-known architects and designers\n\n*   lectures and public talks\n\n*   thousands of amazing people to meet during the event\n\nThe event will consist of several pavilions designed by well-known architectural studios such as Zaha Hadid, SpacesDAO, Atrium, Shop, Crosby Studios (TBC) and others as well as emerging designers selected by a contest. In addition to this there will be lectures, discussions, NFT-exhibitions, art-installations and more, so anyone with interest in architecture and design could enjoy the event.\n\nMANIFESTO\n\nWe believe that as graphic designers have created the internet we’ve been using for the last decades, the Metaverse would be created by architects and designers.\n\nThe tittle of Biennale \"Presence of the future\" refers to the name of the first Venice Architecture Biennale - one of the greatest events to celebrate architecture and design. \"Presence of the past'' was actually the name of the 1980 Biennale directed by Paolo Portoghesi who has managed to organize an event of global significance bringing together great architects from around the world.\n\nNowadays, more than forty years later our perception of the world and design approach have changed dramatically, digital design tools became the main instruments and created a totally new language and, some might say, in our society and culture Postmodernism has been replaced by Metamodernism (whatever that means after the word Meta has become a brand).\n\nAll in all, \"Presence of the future\" aims to recall the power of architecture to reinvent the modernity and formulate the new quality of life in the immersive virtual space. In the moment when we are witnessing the creation of a new game-changer in the way we communicate, entertain and collaborate we challenge the architects and designers to envision our future in the built form and take the responsibility for it. We believe that this exhibition would bring the life-changing power of architecture and design to the metaverse and would set up a new positive vector for its development.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOPEN CALL FOR PARTICIPANTS\n\n1st stage: open call for submissions\nCandidats will send 3 visualisations of 3d-modeled architectural object reflecting the theme of the Biennale “Presence of the Future” and 200-500 words description of the concept. The jury would rate all projects by several criteria such as concept, formal / spatial complexity, atmosphere (use of light, textures, landscape). The function of the space is not limited: event hall, showroom, maze etc.\n\n2st stage: finalists projects realisation\nAll finalists are guaranteed to receive a grant from the organizers to produce the final spaces for the event. The designers with the high estmarks from the open call are paired with selected brands - partners of the event,producing the space in collaboration with them for additional financial grant.\n\nAll submitted projects are checked by the technical team and placed on site of the event prior to its opening.\nOn the final day of the event the jury announces the best project of the Biennale, its creators are invited to become the jury of the next event.\n\nHEADLINERS TO BE INVITED BY THE CURATORS\n\nZaha Hadid Architects - one of the most internationally recognized studios, designers of Liberland Metaverse platform\n\nBIG - one of the most internationally recognized studios, designers of Vice Media Group building in Decentraland\n\nSpacesDAO - one of the most successful metaverse architecture studios founded by Fatemeh Monfared\n\nIheartblob - experimental architecture and design studio, headliners of Tallinn Architecture Biennale\n\nSpace Popular - experimental architecture and design studio, exploring the limits of virtual design\n\nCrosby Studios - design studio working on intersection of art, design and fashion with several metaverse inspired projects\n\nPLP architects - leading design studio, who have recently released NFT collection\n\nDewan architects and engineers - international architectural studio with their own office in metaverse\n\nMVRDV - one of the most internationally recognized studios, who had designed virtual projects already twenty years ago\n\nAsymptote - internationally recognized studio, who had designed virtual projects already twenty years ago\n\nSHOP - internationally recognized studio, who’s recently released a collection of 2500 generated nft-buildings\n\nATRIUM - leading design studio who have compleated several bespoke metaverse projects on different platforms\n\nBIENNALE EVENTS PROGRAM\n\nIn addition to the “build” environment on the Biennale the visitors would have a chance to participate in cultural and entertainment events: Opening + closing ceremonies with the announcement of the participants and the winner.\nLectures & public talks with the participating architects and designers,journalists and metaverse opinion leaders.Topics: The future of virtual architecture, From virtual to augmented reality, How can architecture & design help your business in the metaverse, etc.\n\nSPACE\nWe are looking for an opportunity to invite Decentraland as the main organizer of the Biennale and discuss the possibility of holding an event at one of the plazas.\n\nHowever we have our own dedicated plot in Dragon district with a size of 60 parcels as well as the ownership of 150 parcels in Aetheria district.

The MANA in this contract vests every second, thus gradually increasing the size of the DAO’s fund, at a rate of 1.8M MANA per month. Also, the DAO has its own revenue streams such as marketplace fees and wearable curation fees.\n\nThis proposal defines a strategy to limit the maximum amount of funds that can be allocated quarterly via the Grant Program.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO’s grant program is one of the best vehicles to help grow the Decentraland ecosystem. However, at this moment there is no general consensus about how much the DAO should be investing in this program.\n\nBy  [reviewing the results of more than one-year operations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DjeIf5hXON6jOWagaTj\\_3M2rCm7wa-mrt9bqUE8pfLc/edit?usp=sharing) , *the total budget allocated* since the beginning of the grant program can be calculated:\n\n*   Platform Contributor 35%\t= $2,584,100 USD\n*   Gaming  26%\t= $1,887,500 USD\n*   Community  21%\t= $1,558,400 USD\n*   Content Creator 18%\t= $1,346,809 USD\n\nAlternatively, the results can be displayed in these categories (aligned with the proposed  [new categorization of grants](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fec954c0-75ae-11ed-bc92-ef497b387215) ):\n\n*   In World Content    \t49%\t= $3,545,400 USD\n*   Platform    \t\t21%\t= $1,585,169 USD\n*   Core Unit    \t\t7%\t= $520,200 USD\n*   Sponsorship    \t9%\t= $687,500 USD\n*   Documentation    \t3%\t= $193,800 USD\n*   Social Media Content\t4%\t= $282,240 USD\n*   Accelerator    \t\t7%\t= $487,500 USD\n\nThe DAO needs to agree on how much should be spent and implement a control mechanism to ensure there is no overspending. This will secure the long-standing operations of the DAO.\n\nIt’s also necessary to agree on the distribution of the funds over different categories of projects. This will prevent allocating 95% of the funds to one category and not leaving space for other important initiatives. The DAO should agree on a diversification strategy and revisit it periodically.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Grant Program will be divided into four periods (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4). At the beginning of each quarter the maximum amount of money that can be allocated through the Grants Program will be defined using the formula:\n\n*5,500,000 \\* MANA_PRICE \\* 0.7*\n\nThis means the DAO at maximum capacity will be spending 70% of the MANA received from the vesting contract. For example, using $0.39 as the  [current MANA price](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decentraland/) , the total budget for the quarter will be $1,501,500 USD.\n\nAlso the DAO should set a desired distribution of funds on the different grant categories. Define the maximum amount of funds that can be allocated to a particular activity and when that number is reached, it won’t be possible to request more grants of that category until the start of the next quarter.\n\nBelow is the proposed distribution for the first quarter, including the quarter budgets using the previous example of a MANA price of $0.39:\n\n*   Platform \t\t40%  = $600,600 USD (per quarter)\n*   In-World Content \t15% \t= $225,225 USD\n*   Core Unit \t\t15%\t= $225,225 USD\n*   Sponsorship \t\t15%\t= $225,225 USD\n*   Accelerator \t\t5%\t= $75,075 USD\n*   Documentation \t5%\t= $75,075 USD\n*   Social Media Content 5%\t= $75,075 USD\n\nThe DAO can change this distribution in the future via a Governance Proposal or by implementing an alternative voting mechanism such as *weighted voting*.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe DAO has an income of 1.8M MANA every month and it should set up a limit control to not spend more than 70% of such a stream. This will mitigate the risk of running out of funds in the next 7 years.\n\nThe DAO should agree on limits for each category, so that the funds are distributed based on a targeted strategy. This will encourage initiatives in underfunded categories.\n\nThe DAO refreshes and recalculates the category budgets using the MANA price at the beginning of each quarter. It’s possible that many grant requests will be submitted when such limits are refreshed, looking to secure their budget before it’s allocated to other initiatives. This could be beneficial for the DAO, encouraging competition and ultimately leveling up the bar.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b2626480-75b0-11ed-bc92-ef497b387215)**",

A  [community vote](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b265e3e0-bcb0-11eb-a871-a927ffd81f49)  approved the current categories, more than a year ago, and now is a good time to review the results and propose improvements.\n\nBy  [reviewing the results of one-year operations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QM7pHOcR9yUdJstdudcoHi9qKXwj\\_6Q9rDY89wjHU0k/edit?usp=sharing) , some conclusions can be drawn:\n\n*   The Grant Program has allocated funds to a diversity of projects.\n*   The current categories are too broad and sometimes misused.\n*   Each category should have clear requirements and impact measurements.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nEvery grant must:\n\n*   Comply with Decentraland’s Content Policy,  Terms of Use, and  Code of Ethics.\n*   Declare personnel, budget breakdown, and roadmap.\n*   Provide monthly updates on the Governance dApp.\n*   Provide a presentation in a video format to be shared publicly.\n*   Be responsive to DAO Committee and Core Unit communications.\n\nThe proposed categories are:\n\n**1- Core Unit**\n\nProvide core infrastructure and operations for the DAO. The work done is essential for the organization and grantees may be considered official representatives of the DAO.\n\n*   Requirements:\n    *   Provide an essential or strategic value to the DAO.\n    *   Build in the public, publishing open source code and documentation.\n*   Performance Metrics:\n    *   Participation in Governance dApp, DAO Town Halls, and Discord server.\n\n**2- Platform**\nCreation of tools and applications that extend the power of the Decentraland platform or provide alternative ways to explore Decentraland’s ecosystem.\n\n*   Requirements:\n    *   Build in the public, publishing open source code and documentation.\n*   Performance Metrics:\n    *   The number of contributions made to the main repository of code.\n    *   Publish the tool or application to production and provide usage metrics.\n\n**3- Documentation**\nCreation of free educational content about how to contribute, build and play on Decentraland. The content should be published on official mediums to be found and preserved for posterity.\n\n*   Requirements:\n    *   The topic shouldn’t be already well-covered in the official documentation.\n    *   Provide examples of documentation done in the past.\n    *   Describe the format of documentation to be produced.\n    *   To be published in official mediums.\n*   Performance Metrics:\n    *   The number of contributions to Decentraland Documentation\n    *   The number of contributions to the Awesome Repository.\n\n**4- In-World Content**\nDevelopment of attractive experiences in Decentraland that generate retention of users. The experiences can be in the form of scenes, games, and events, in any case, consumed by players through the reference client.\n\n*   Requirements:\n    *   Deploy content or host events in Decentraland.\n*   Performance Metrics:\n    *   Newley populated land, Active Users, Returning Users, Time on Scene.\n    *   Events created and # of attendees to the event.\n\n**5- Social Media Content**\nProjects to create content on social media platforms such as Twitch, Twitter, Youtube, Tik Tok, and Discord. The project aims to reach new users and keep them engaged.\n\n*   Requirements:\n    *   Explain audience size and relevancy to Decentraland.\n*   Performance Metrics:\n    *   Number of pieces to be produced\n    *   Total of views and interactions of the created content.\n    *   Engagement metrics (likes, retweets, reach, retention)\n    *   Mentions in other media outlets.\n\n**6- Sponsorship**\nSupporting conferences, side events, community meetups, hackathons, and contest prices that target audiences relevant to Decentraland.\n\n*   Requirements:\n    *   The event is happening IRL or online but outside of Decentraland.\n    *   Ensure Decentraland DAO brand awareness during the event.\n*   Performance Metrics:\n    *   Number of attendees and level of brand awareness.\n    *   Evidence of the project execution (photos, videos, publications).\n    *   Mentions in media outlets.\n\n**7- Accelerator**\nA private company or revenue-generating initiative looking forward to receiving an investment from the DAO.\n\n*   Requirement:\n    *   Revenue share with the DAO or alternative value proposition.\n*   Performance Metrics:\n    *   Returns of Investment.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal redefines the previous four categories into a new set of seven categories, each of them with a clear scope, requirements, and key performance indicators to measure its impact.\n\nThe application form to request a grant should make the requester acknowledge the requirements for the grant category. Grants that do not pass the requirements or are badly categorized should be rejected by community vote.\n\nIt’s important for the community and the grantee to agree on the goal of the project and the performance metrics that will be used to measure the impact of the project. Failing to demonstrate results on these performance metrics may result in revoking the grant funding.\n\nHaving well-defined categories is a prerequisite for doing proper budgeting, based on these categories the DAO will be able to vote on how to allocate the resources to each category.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fec954c0-75ae-11ed-bc92-ef497b387215)**",

    "title": "DAO Grants Program - New Vesting Contract",
    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Restructuring the  Community Grants Program](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e2fbd710-426c-11ed-9eb2-21be7ab68113)\n\n## Summary\n\nRedesign the smart contract used to allocate funds to projects supported via the Grants Program.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe DAO is currently using a *linear vesting* contract to pay grantees. This proposal aims to replace the current second-by-second schedule with a regular 30-day payment scheme.\n\nThe new vesting contract should also allow the DAO to preemptively pause the vesting contract, to later decide to resume it or revoke it.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO’s grant program is one of the best vehicles to help grow the Decentraland ecosystem. Since the inception of Decentraland, linear vesting contracts have been used to distribute funds.\n\nA typical *linear vesting* schedule has a month *cliff*, in which no funds are accessible, and after day 30 the payment for the elapsed month is made available. The rest of the funds are released second by second until the end of the contract.\nThe linear vesting model is a simple and elegant method to distribute funds over time, however, it might be too optimistic and generate some caveats around the revocation process.\n\nNowadays, when a project doesn’t report any progress for a while or the reported progress is not related to the project roadmap, the DAO committee proceeds to a *preemptive revocation*. It is the best course of action to protect the DAO’s treasury.\n\nThe concept of preemptive revocation strikes really badly on grantees and the general morale in the community. Implementing a new vesting schedule and a mechanism to pause/resume the vesting can ease a lot the process of overviewing grant-funded projects.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe new vesting schedule should follow a step function, where compensation is made available in chunks over periods of time. This means the beneficiary is paid in arrears; they are paid for a working period AFTER the work is done.\n\nThe Grant Program should standardize payment contracts with 30 days periods and equal payment amounts for each period. Different amounts per month could be defined for non-standard situations after the review of the DAO Committee.\n\nThe vesting contract should be always initialized on the 1st day or the 15th day of the month, this will give some time of preparation to the grantee between the votation finishes and the work starts. This will also order projects over time and synchronize updates made by grantees through the Governance dApp at the end of half of the month.\n\nThe new vesting contract should include the capacity to pause and resume the vesting schedule. In case a grantee didn’t report progress before the current period ends, the contract could be paused. If the project reports progress short after, the vesting can be resumed without delays in the schedule. Otherwise, the vesting contract should be revoked and later recreated if necessary.\n\nThe operations of pause, resume and revoke can only be performed by the DAO through the DAO Committee.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA new vesting schedule of constant periods of 30 days it’s an easy model to understand and better protects the DAO’s treasury.\n\nIt removes the anxiety of overviewing projects that are not reporting progress but still continue to vest funds every day. It pays for the work done and not while it’s being performed.\n\nThe capacity to pause and resume it later adds an extra layer of security, setting expectations to grantees about making a public update of their progress every month, otherwise, the vesting contract will be preemptively paused. In case they show up with progress, the vesting is resumed quite easily. Otherwise, the contract can be revoked and recreated with a new schedule if necessary.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=10b93a80-75ad-11ed-bc92-ef497b387215)**",

    "title": "DAO Grants Program - New Tiers & VP Threshold",
    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Restructuring the  Community Grants Program](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e2fbd710-426c-11ed-9eb2-21be7ab68113)\n\n## Summary\n\nRedefine the tiers of the DAO’s Grant Program, making it more flexible and secure.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nCurrently the grants program allow the following Tiers:\n\n*   **Tier 1:** Up to $1500 USD in MANA (1M VP + 7 days) - One Time Payment\n*   **Tier 2:** Up to $3000 USD in MANA (1M VP + 7 days) - One Time Payment\n*   **Tier 3:** Up to $5000 USD in MANA (1M VP + 7 days) - 3 Months Vesting\n*   **Tier 4:** Up to $60,000 USD (2M VP + 14 days) - 6 Months Vesting\n*   **Tier 5:** Up to $120,000 USD (4M VP + 14 days) - 6 Months Vesting\n*   **Tier 6:** Up to $240,000 USD (8M VP + 14 days) - 6 Months Vesting\n\nThis proposal simplifies all six categories and redefines the VP threshold required to access such grants. It also makes it more flexible by allowing the grantee to define the duration of the project and the payable currency (MANA vs stablecoins).\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO’s grant program is one of the best vehicles to help grow the Decentraland ecosystem. The current tiers structure was approved by a  [community vote](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b265e3e0-bcb0-11eb-a871-a927ffd81f49)   almost a year ago, and now is a good time to review the results and propose improvements.\n\nBy  [reviewing the results of one year operations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VAVGZYbhV98hHxc2M39d-6XqeVG8ov2kvS9Yaxp0TyY/edit?usp=sharing) , some conclusions can be drawn:\n\n*   The tiers 1, 2, 3 represent 2.5% of the money granted.\n*   Tier 6 represents ~60% of the money granted, with an acceptance rate of 27%.\n*   The tier 4 is the most easily approved one, with an acceptance rate of 45%.\n*   Voters generally abstain from expressing their decision if the current result is aligned with their preference and the threshold has been achieved.\n*   Grantees almost always request the maximum budget allowed in the tier.\n*   Many projects requested funds for a scope longer than 6 months.\n*   The VP involved on grants has steadily increased over time, and it’s likely that only highly contentious grants get voted on by more voting power.\n\nFor this revised version of the Grants Program, the following changes are proposed:\n\n*   Adjust the minimum VP threshold required to pass a small-tier grant.\n\n*   Make the VP threshold variable based on the requested amount; the more money you need, the more VP is needed.\n\n*   Allow more flexible vesting schedules to support different kinds of projects (longer and shorter than 6 months).\n\n\n## Specification\n\nA new scheme of two tiers is recommended:\n\n**Lower Tier:**\n\n*   Up to $20,000 USD, payable in stablecoins or MANA using a Vesting Contract, or a one-time payment (after 30 days).\n*   Vesting duration can range from 1 to 6 months.\n*   Votation period: 2 weeks.\n*   Votation threshold: 2M VP.\n\n**Higher Tier:**\n\n*   From $20,000 to $240,000 USD, payable in stablecoins using a Vesting Contract.\n*   Vesting duration can range from 3 to 12 months.\n*   Votation Period: 2 weeks.\n*   Variable votation threshold, using the formula:  [1.2M + TOTAL_BUDGET \\* 40VP/USD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VAVGZYbhV98hHxc2M39d-6XqeVG8ov2kvS9Yaxp0TyY/edit#gid=146607161) .\n    *   E.g. $60,000 USD requires 3,600,000 VP\n    *   E.g. $120,000 USD requires 6,000,000 VP\n    *   E.g. $240,000 USD requires 10,800,000 VP\n\n**Analysis and considerations for the future**\nThere are two parameters of this model that could be easily changed over time in contrast to the current tiers system, allowing for more flexibility and a quicker iteration of this structure over time as participating VP increases. Those are:\n\n*   The 2M threshold on the lower tier\n*   The slope of the threshold on the higher tier (currently set to 40 VP per USD requested)\n\nParticipation over time could be monitored and changes in these parameters could be suggested based on more information and data collected from this new schema. This factor could also follow a nonlinear relationship to the amount being requested, but a thorough analysis of why that would be beneficial should support such change.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed change aims to adjust the required VP thresholds, aligning them with current standards of participation in the DAO.\n\nMaking the VP threshold variable based on the requested amount will encourage the grantees to be more mindful of their budgets.\n\nAlso, removing the limitation of 6-month vesting and allowing grantees to define the duration of the project would make it possible to fund short-term goals such as conference sponsorships and IRL gatherings; and also year-long initiatives that are considered core to the operations of the DAO.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=69b1fb50-75ac-11ed-bc92-ef497b387215)**",

    "title": "Delegate the Reference Client roadmap to the Decentraland Foundation",
    "body": "> by 0xadd3b79052ae213a732c9267081f0a943fc6ff7c\n\n### Summary\n\nShould the Decentraland DAO delegate the responsibility of developing and executing the roadmap for the Reference Client to the Foundation?\n\n### Abstract\n\nThe Reference Client (the app at play.decentraland.org) is currently the most widely used Decentraland client. Right now, the Decentraland Foundation is the main contributor to the Reference Client’s open source code base, but given the DAO’s ownership of the client (and the need to have the DAO approve major changes), the Foundation is hindered in how quickly and effectively it can develop new features and improvements.\n\nTo overcome this hurdle, the Foundation is suggesting that the DAO delegate the development and maintenance of the Reference Client to the Foundation. This delegation would be reviewed and renewed every 12 months.\n\nThis delegation would empower the Foundation to:\n\n*   Communicate and execute a solid roadmap both for community developers and users\n*   Build a richer feature set (e.g. better in-world navigation, social interaction, and content moderation tools)\n*   Ensure that the client is faster and more stable\n*   Improve the quality and performance of the client’s graphics\n*   Improve the client’s ability to support more concurrent users\n\n### Background\n\nTo better understand the scope of this proposed delegation and the extent of it’s impact on the broader platform, it’s important to define some terms:\n\n#### The “DAO”\n\nThe DAO was created to help the community direct the development of Decentraland’s policies, infrastructure, content moderation, and smart contracts. The DAO owns the smart contracts for Decentraland’s digital assets (like LAND, Names, Wearables, etc.), so any changes made to those contracts must be approved by the DAO. Furthermore, platform-impacting decisions or changes to Decentraland’s codebase (i.e. decisions that impact the entire Decentraland community, like strategic decisions for the client) must be approved by the DAO.\n\n#### The “Decentraland Foundation”\n\nThe Foundation is a non-profit organization that was formed to help protect the intellectual property of the Decentraland brand (something that the DAO lacks the legal status to do). The Foundation was also tasked with supporting the decentralization of the platform alongside the community.\n\n#### The “Decentraland Stack”\n\nDecentraland is made up of a complex “stack” of different smart contracts, protocols, and applications. Together, they make up the Decentraland Platform. Generally speaking, the different decentralized layers can defined as:\n\n1.  The **smart contracts** that make  Decentraland’s scarce digital assets (like LAND, Estates, Wearables, Names, etc) possible.\n2.  The **Catalyst software** used to run the distributed network of servers that host and provide content to users.\n3.  The **software development kit** that people use to build content for Decentraland’s virtual world.\n4.  **dApps like the Builder** that allow people to create and arrange content for Decentraland’s virtual world without writing code.\n5.  **dApps like the Marketplace** that allow people to manage and exchange Decentraland’s digital assets.\n6.  **Clients** that allow users to interact with the content of Decentraland. Decentraland clients are like web browsers (e.g. Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox) in that they all provide access to the same network and information, but are not the web itself. In 2022, this also includes the PC and Mac clients, currently in beta and available to download from https://decentraland.org/download.\n\n#### The “Reference Client”\n\nThe Decentraland Reference Client discussed in this proposal is the web based app and the PC and Mac clients that allow people to access and interact with content and other users within Decentraland’s virtual world. This application sits at the top of the Decentraland Stack.\n\nIt’s helpful to remember that the Reference Client does not constitute the entire Decentraland Platform, that it is just one alternative for accessing the Decentraland Platform, that anyone can develop a customized client, and that the roadmap discussed in this proposal for the Reference Client can’t dictate changes to any other components of the platform—those must still be approved by the DAO on a case by case basis.\n\n### Specification\n\n#### Duration and renewal of the delegation\n\nThe DAO would delegate to the Foundation the responsibility of developing and maintaining the Reference Client for a period of 12 months, according to a roadmap approved by the DAO on a biannual schedule.\nThe Foundation will be responsible for presenting and delivering a product roadmap for 2023.\n\nThe roadmap will be prioritized in collaboration with the DAO by implementing a mechanism for proposing and signaling support on new initiative.\n\n#### Ideation and validation for the roadmap\n\nThe DAO will have a clear path to contribute ideas and requests to the roadmap. This could take the form of a new polling category within the DAO, specific to client feature requests and suggestions. These proposals could then be voted on by the community, with accepted suggestions being passed to the Foundation for inclusion in the next iteration of the product roadmap.\n\n#### Deviations from the roadmap\n\nThe Foundation would be able to reasonably depart from the roadmap to make full use of the Foundation’s familiarity with the competitive market, Decentraland’s user base, and regulatory requirements\n\n#### Funding development\n\nFunds to develop the Reference Client (e.g. payroll for developers) would still be provided by the Foundation, not the DAO.\n\n#### Termination of the delegation\n\nThe DAO may choose at any time to revoke this delegation in favor of giving it to another entity.\n\n#### Limits of the delegation\n\nThe delegation is limited to the Reference Client and does not allow the Foundation to make changes to other areas of the Decentraland platform; any such changes must pass through a vote in the DAO.\n\n### Rationale\n\n*   The Reference Client is a complex application that is relevant to the continued development of the platform.\n*   The development life cycle for something as complex as the client requires countless technical and strategic decisions to be made on a daily basis\n*   Given the time it takes to write proposals and pass them through the DAO, it would be extremely impractical to have the DAO weigh in on each of these decisions\n*   So, it’s clear that in order to develop the client at a speed sufficient to compete with other metaverse projects, at least some level of formal delegation is needed\n*   The Foundation is the best candidate to receive this delegation given its proximity to the platform, its resources, and its knowledge of the market and the Decentraland community\n*   The suggested delegation would provide the Foundation with the autonomy needed to execute quickly, while still being subject to the relevant decisions, directions, and control of the DAO\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2c061ab0-75a3-11ed-bc92-ef497b387215)**",

    "body": "> by 0x56469159d91eb810dce34dd13ec4ed8194bca7be (iNikki)\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nVroomway is a racing game where players race and collect resources to craft their dual utility NFT. Our NFTs double as Skins and Vehicles. Players can race, craft, and upgrade completely free. We have a 4x4 estate that houses 6 different interactive instanced scenes. That’s a total 1,536 square meters packed with unique experiences.\n\nVroomway’s mission is to provide a safe haven for vehicle lovers and racers of all kinds. We aim to provide a dynamic variety of experiences for both solo play and cooperative play. Start your laps today and earn your very own Metaverse Vehicle!\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3fxFGqx.jpg)\n\nPlay Link: https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-103%2C-144\nGame Trailer: https://vimeo.com/763237194/d59035c4f6\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4b99aD2Fad8B5553dc734EDA80695591b3CA1fD5\n\n## Email address\n\nvroomwayracing@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nVroomway tells the story of a future where machines and human consciousness are one. A world created by machines for everyone to enjoy. Vroomway is the space station that bridges worlds all over the galaxy to Planeta Volo. This means the Planet of Speed in Latin. Vroomway provides the bridge to the future of what is possible. To inspire hope and encourage everyone to live in the moment and enjoy all the fun experiences life has to offer.\n\nVroomway is managed by a core team of 3 with our lead developer handling the infrastructure and back end. We have a community manager that is in charge of engaging our community on discord and in-game. Our community manager also helps onboard new players and provides community events to keep the core engaged. Our marketing person handles the social media accounts, and partner relationships and ideates/execute our marketing strategies. Our Project Manager manages and executes our business direction and project vision. They lead the game development process and 3D artwork development.\n\nVroomway has seen a gradual increase in our analytics since launching our Grand Opening on October 1st, 2022. Currently, we are seeing an average of 50 daily active users. Some days we peak at 150 while other days we valley at 43. On a monthly basis, we are seeing over 3700 sessions from our players. We expect to triple our Daily Active users over the next 3 months by fully utilizing our Social Friday experiences, consistent game releases, and upcoming partner collaborations. We plan to release a brand new Fuego Circuits track every month, and brand new vehicles and attributes often.\n\n### Milestones Achieved:\n\n*   Revenue has been generated each month from in-game purchases, wearable royalties, and build commissions. We have given 5% of those revenues back to the DAO total of $152.40 USDC over 3 months.\n*   NFT floor prices rising as high as 750% on some vehicles.\n*   Players have already earned 224 mana from crafting 7 of the 12 new skins/vehicles. The highest floor is currently 60 mana.\n*   Twitter account nearing 600 followers.\n*   Fully integrated 21 NFT-based vehicles with full functionality.\n*   Two additional non-vehicle NFT-based wearables with full functionality.\n*   Established a new sponsor: The Holy Ones to our 3 existing sponsors.\n*   Created 3 Game Modes: Solo-Sprint, Demo Derby, and Fuego Circuits.\n*   Created 5 different game tracks.\n*   Integrated 9 different collectible resources and a robust crafting system.\n*   Built an interactive club with Dance and Earn utility with live events and unique musical entertainment.\n*   Held 3 different parties to celebrate the launch of each stage of the game with a DJ performance, and community giveaways - One for Alpha, Beta, and the launch.\n*   Including performances by our own Nikki Fuego in Drag, bringing more Drag culture to Decentraland.\n*   Organized 9 giveaways, of Beta wings, vehicles, and in-game rewards.\n*   We started a 10-week tournament where we pick 1 winner with the fastest Solo-Sprint time and awarded 10 MANA. In our first 4 weeks, we have had 175 participants!\n*   Started our weekly events with LIVE entertainment and giveaways. (In week 4 as of writing this)\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eTmkZq7.png)\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8f27Rkd.png)\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tZgaIh0.png)\n\nGameplay Promo: https://vimeo.com/773551445/93a5942257\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo get Vroomway to the next level we will need additional resources. We have an extremely unique setup with our instancing and require some outside skillsets to elevate parts of our infrastructure. Our integration with the Infinity Engine was a huge accomplishment and enhanced Vroomway’s original vision tenfold. We learned a lot with that integration and it has sparked even more innovation on how to develop this going forward. We would like to both upgrade and enhance the current game modes, but also release some community-suggested game modes that we believe will put Vroomway above par with previous racing games in the web3 industry. This new budget also allows the majority of our team to give more full-time attention to the project.\n\nWe have generated revenue consistently over 4 months and have generated revenue this month (November) as well.\n\nOur game generated over 2,500 MANA sales in wearables (primary and secondary combined). In addition, our players purchased 452 MANA worth of FUEL in-game.\n\nIt’s worth noting that since the beginning of our first grant we vowed to pay 5% of our revenue generated each month back to the DAO until the grant is paid back. We are keeping that vow with this grant as well. We have already shown good faith in this with 4 consecutive months of giving 5% back totaling $155~. Although a small amount, it shows that we can create revenue and eventually pay back the grants in full.\n\n### Budget Breakdown & Road Map:\n\nMarketing: $19,800 - 6 months\n\nPersonnel: $54,000 - 6 months\n\nDevelopment: $43,000 - 6 months\n\nUnexpected/Cushion: $3,200 - 6 months\n\nTotal: $120,000\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xqg7Qa2.png)\n\nWe have revised the previous budget to exclude 50% of the personnel cost, $30k in development cost, and 50% of the previous marketing budget.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nNikki Fuego - Founder, Project Manager, Lead 3D Artist:\nhttps://twitter.com/NikkiFuego92\n\nNeocyber - Lead Developer:\nhttps://twitter.com/neocyber_eth\n\nDOCTORdripp - Community Manager:\nhttps://twitter.com/DOCTORdrippNFT\n\nckbubbles - Marketing, PR, Event Coordinator:\nhttps://twitter.com/iamckbubbles\n\nDoki - 3D Wearables:\nhttps://twitter.com/Doki3D\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe believe we can achieve the goals mentioned above with 3 phases:\n\nJanuary 2023 & February 2023\nPhase 1 - Refactor & Upgrade:\n\nWe plan to refactor some of our earliest infrastructure for better scene performance. We will also refactor our Demo Derby Game Mode as this has been the most difficult hurdle we have faced. We want to redesign the game mode with better technology. We will upgrade our other game modes and the gathering profession to provide variety in difficulty and experiences. We will also add in-game coin sinks with these upgrades.\n\nMarch 2023 & April 2023\nPhase  - New Game Modes and Player Ownership Value:\n\nPlayers have heavily requested two new game modes that are Drag Racing and a new version of our Grand Prix that was held in April of 2022. Drag Racing would be a linear sprint utilizing the infinity engine. It would be a point a to point b sprint with gear-shifting mechanics integrated.\nThe Grand Prix game mode would be an event every 6 months that supports up to 20 racers racing in an Indie 500-style race.\n\nMay 2023 & June 2023\nPhase 3 - Player Economy and Ownership Value:\n\nWe believe that the players are the most important part of our game aside from the fun factor. With this in mind, we want to always provide value both in the economy and the time spent in-game. We would like to introduce new ways to earn via mini-games that add more value to the main game modes.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=29b3a3a0-74fd-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556)**",

A detailed view of the objectives can be found in the Roadmap and Milestones section of this proposal.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis grant will set up a budget to run this team for the next 6 months. This grant could be extended upon a further decision of the DAO if the grant succeeds in its objectives. The DAO Governance Squad has been set up as a Panama sole-purpose, Non-for-Profit Foundation. The costs associated with maintaining the foundation are included in this Grant. The same Conditions of the Grant detailed in the [original founding proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) still apply.\n\nThe grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stablecoins assigned to a 2-out-of-3 signatures [wallet](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x3bf800b6F5c987b3738432068f789b7d131F1698/transactions/history).

We will build monitors that will display the game for your DCL Character & with your mouse you can control the character in- game by clicking on the display.\n\nWe are now seeking for a $59,470 grant build our game for Decentraland.\n\n**Demo**\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jtjSLj9CrM\\&feature=emb_title\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n59,470 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xed0E0cb94F60F72ec94beF848f5dF4Cbd365aF1D\n\n## Email address\n\naskingaskin@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n**What is Duel Arena P2E?**\n\nDuel Arena is an open world game where you will be able to play with your own character, you can choose from 4 great nations, Fire, Water, Air & Earth. Each nation will start with 2 characters which is going to be 1 female character & 1 male character.\n\nYour character will always spawn in the hub where you have 4 core teleports each teleport leading you to a different nation, each nation has its own challenges to accomplish.\n\nYou will be able to explore the nation, dual AI bots & players. A duelling match will be strategic based, almost like a chess board. In the duelling instance you will be able to use certain NFT skills which are purchasable through the store but don’t worry you will have the basics to start the game with.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Specification**\n**Why do we need this grant?**\n\nWe started up this project with our own funds, our input is estimated around 45,000$ and are still living of this credit. This start-up helped us build a demo game, website, web market & a gameplay paper.\n\nWe haven’t seen a game in DCL yet with unlimited power to expand through 1 parcel since all of the projects are limited with lands & scenes. We are going to change this with our tech building monitors in a 1x2 Parcel where the game will be playable on for each individual.\n\nIt would be possible for us to build this game independently from Decentraland, but we intend to grow together, we want our players to be able to interact with the game through the MetaVerse. This would help us get more players and it will help Decentraland to be the MetaVerse with this enjoyable game.\n\n**Building the game**\n\nWe are building the game mainly in Unity engine, Photoshop, Blender & SDK. On our weblink you will be able to see all of our progress, Gameplay paper, update changelog & expense calculations we have made so far.\n\nWe keep updates for the game mainly on:\nhttps://www.duelarenap2e.com/grant\n\n**How is the Grant going to be spend?**\n\nWe have a nice written documentation of our expenses written on our website, showing our initial expenses with & without DCL.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https:%2F%2Ffastly.jwwb.nl%2Fplugin-documents%2Fee8bbd84249a13c543e7f098bc041b94803ae266.pdf\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**Personnel**\n\nBurak Ucar Management\nInJesterr Management\nEmselada & InJesterr Graphical designer\nDilara Community manager\nGhuskh & Philip Game Developer\nKaan Aydin Web Developer\nFurkan, Oguzhan, Michael, Kaan & Dilara Moderator\nLead & Management (1 & 2) Burak & InJesterr are needed to guide the team somewhere, we come up with the idea’s, holding finance and working materials. https://nl.linkedin.com/in/burak-ucar-898b8b133\n\n**Graphical designers (3)** InJesterr & Emselada Drawing artist\n**Instagram; @emselada\\_**\n\n**Community manager (4)** InJesterr Maintaining community by doing events, helping the moderator to function properly.\n\n**Game developer (5)** Ghushkh & Philip are both independent game developers, they are both necessary for this project since 1 works with the 3D game development & the other with 2D Game development. https://www.fiverr.com/drenk0?source=inbox\n\n**Web developer (6)** Kaan is a skilled web developer who was ready contributing us a domain name, webmail, web build & even webserver for free. https://k-e-aydin.com/\n\n**Moderators (7)** They keep everyone in the game & community chats satisfied, they moderate our social accounts and keep an eye on e-mails.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**You will be able to see all our progress through:** https://www.duelarenap2e.com/grant we do have a meeting every sunday at 17:00 UTC+2 and will update the page at least at 21:00 UTC+2 after the meeting if we have updates.\n\nOn this site you will be able to read our gameplay paper, expenses, view our progress & check out our demo (only playable to developers and early beta testers).\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=aeef5550-74d5-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556)**",

    "title": "Should VP keep assigned to the landowner in a LAND Rental transaction?",
    "body": "> by 0x87956abc4078a0cc3b89b419928b857b8af826ed (Nacho)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Should VP keep assigned to the landowner in a LAND Rental transaction?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bfe67a00-6b4d-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598)\n\n## Summary\n\nFormalize the mechanism to assign Voting Power in a LAND Rental transaction making sure the VP stays assigned to the LAND owner wallet and it’s not lost or assigned to the renter in the transaction.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal promotes to the next governance stage the outcome decided by the community on the previously published poll regarding Voting Power assignation in the new LAND Rental protocol being built by the Decentraland Foundation.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, there are multiple LAND Rental protocols created by the community but by using them, every time a LAND or Estate is rented, a smart contract functions as the escrow of the asset. Therefore, the asset owner is the Rental smart contract, and that Voting Power (VP) gets “lost”. In other words, that VP will be assigned to the Rental smart contract who cannot possibly vote or do anything on the DAO. We need a strategy to assign the VP to the renter’s wallet to fix this. We need to ensure that in the ideal case of renting is a widely used strategy in the Decentraland ecosystem, the circulating Voting Power is not retired from circulation.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation has already created a Snapshot strategy to keep the VP as the owner of the LANDs and Estates.\n\nThe way this would work is that whenever a rental starts and the NFT is transferred to the Rentals contract, a new entity in the Rentals subgraph is created called RentalAsset that keeps track of the lessor (original owner), the contract address, and the tokenId of that NFT, as well as whether the NFT has been claimed back from the contract.\nGiven a list of user addresses, the strategy first queries the Rentals subgraph to obtain all RentalAssets that have the provided addresses as lessors. For example, if the list contains User 1 and User 2, it will look for all RentalAssets where User 1 and User 2 are lessors.\nFor the rental assets that correspond to Lands, the strategy will give VP for their lessors determined by the multiplier determined by configuration. For example, if 5 of the obtained rental assets are Lands where User 2 is the lessor, User 2 will be given 5 \\* multiplier of VP.\nAn extra step is required for the rental assets that correspond to Estates. As VP for Estates is determined by the size of the Estate, we need a way to obtain that information, as the rental asset does not provide it.\nSo for each rental asset that is an Estate, the strategy will query the Marketplace subgraph to obtain their sizes, once the data is obtained, the strategy will give VP for their lessors determined by their sizes and a multiplier determined by configuration. For example, if User 2 has 2 rental assets that are Estates that both have 10 Lands each, User 2 will be given a 2 \\* 10 \\* multiplier of VP.\n\nYou can check the strategy [here](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/tree/master/src/strategies/decentraland-rental-lessors)\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nLAND and Estate owners will keep their VP to vote on proposals while renting the asset.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe strategy is already implemented. You can  take a look [here](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/tree/master/src/strategies/decentraland-rental-lessors) to the code\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLAND Rental is fundamental for the Decentraland ecosystem because it will allow content creators and Metaverse builders to get access to LAND without having to buy it. By making sure the reference rental protocol created by the Decentraland Foundation does not reduce the circulating Voting Power in the DAO we are strengthening our governance mechanisms\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c98bd010-74b1-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556)**",

Without problems I have been able to work basic concepts due to the clarity in the use of the sdk provided and of course thinking of the storing of this accounts:\nhttps://github.com/orgs/decentraland-scenes/repositories\nHowever I've been wondering while working on the main logic controllers to animate entities... and if this is done already?... what about if someone developed some similar functionality? Sometimes it is essential and very helpful to have a guide or index to review. How about if we make one? When i used dcl sdk to try some things when anímate entities… my head surrounded with this Kind of questions all the time…\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x916b441eA876B1c59084f8c9BDE233155dD14c0C\n\n## Email address\n\ndcledgar23@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nFor this first part... if the community likes it... we would build a platform that will help to have visibility on some functionalities made in developed projects provided by the community where the code is already stored in github. Thing that would serve as a base for anyone who wants to appreciate the way someone else solved a certain problem.\nThis index would be feeding in the long term by anyone who wanted to contribute or share the information with the same community in an orderly manner, appreciating the context in which a certain project related to decentraland was created. Being the first to collect some base links, some of you shared to me the knowing of their repos existence and i was grateful.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWhat I would like to cover with the support of the community is the structure of the platform, on a basic server for this first instance with an AWS EC2 machine, I will use docker to containerize the services, mysql to manage the database, and I will be developing the project with the python stack on the FLASK framework, using bootstrap framework for help me with the style and responsivity renders.\nExcited, I began to develop the basic structure in dlchub.co with some basic renders to visualize the uses, I have not yet released the generation and registration of users, but internally they already have a basic structure to visualize the basic renders from inside and outside the login . I attach a screenshot of the section my profile: https://imgur.com/uIEqjsD\nAs well as the generation of the forms that fill the database from the myprofile section leave the following link of its operation through twitter https://twitter.com/dcl_edgar23/status/1599626159662112768?s=20\\&t=EwS9BOnbJs6dr-WqqvliYA\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nAt this time i have been working solo, as developer working for 6 years solving backed issues for a telecommunications company using python, flask, django, reactJs as well as nodejs i will leading the Project.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nBeing this a pilot test mounted in production on dclhub.co to be liked by the community I would like for this first part (in addition to obtaining feedback from the community):\n\n*   Finalize the functionality of the forms to store on the server online together with the information of each one of them, which will include the title, description, author, creator of the post, date of creation and up to 3 images per post\n*   Finalize the main public render where all the posts with the information are appreciated at a macro level in an aesthetic and ergonomic way\n*   Have some predefined contributors for this instance while we deploy and grow the idea to generate structured and valuable information, which at this stage the contributions will not be available to users in general, but the public information would be available for everyone to appreciate the posts and the information inside them.\n    In the long term we would love to add more features that allow to give even more value to each post provided, that serves as a guide for all users who are interested in getting involved in the development of scenes through the sdk.\n    Hoping to be assertive with this development i would like tho work on this and finish it in 2 weeks max, I am attentive to the comments of each one and thank you very much for taking the time to read this request.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4a3e37a0-745f-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556)**",

The collection was generated with more than 500 unique wearable items, each created from Ha Jung-Woo's original artworks. The collection features the unique style of Ha Jung Woo’s artwork in the form of NFTs that embodies the beauty and diversity of what Supernormal stands for. Because there is a limited supply of only 978 NFTs, you will be provided with a rare opportunity to enjoy multiple linked wearable items that allow your Decentraland avatars to look like your Ha Jung-Woo X SuperNormal PFP.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nFashion allows people to express themselves and their identities without saying a word.\nOur mission is to keep generating digital wearables so that Decentraland players can enjoy beautiful and unique wearables that we will continuously be creating.\n\nAvant Garde is increasing partnerships with various artists and fashion brands to generate more digital wearables to present more variations of wearable items. We hope Decentraland will become our main stage for releasing upcoming collections as well.\n\nWe will never stop until people can fully express themselves in metaverse games.

    "body": "> by 0x86edb92e217605dbecf606548e48daaf1b817da1 (MetaTrekkers)\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nBudget Breakdown - https://bit.ly/3Xyyiwf\n\nBy now, the word metaverse has become a household name. This concept is one of a new, alternative reality complete with almost all the amenities of real life.\nTo be able to truly compete with real life experiences, the metaverse has to step up its offerings and start including features that transcend the virtual/real barrier and provide its users with value they can benefit from in their day-to-day life. This is the premise of our platform.\nMetaTrekkers, using its reputation and connections, is set to bring the most ambitious and comprehensive educational proposal, which will actively work towards increasing the number of highly-engaged users in Decentraland, interested in learning and development.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x50a83425d537e39a0b7f884dCC07e6f4F37A09F3\n\n## Email address\n\nhello@metatrekkers.io\n\n## Description\n\nThe belief that positive development and evolution of the metaverse can only be achieved through educating the users, has been at the core of our value proposition from the very beginning.\n\nIn preparation for development of this education platform, MetaTrekkers has already begun securing collaborations with various keynote speakers and personalities who are considered leading professionals in their fields.\n\nOur aim is to onboard their massive follower audience and those interested in the topics promoted by these guests, and introduce them to the perks of education through the metaverse:\nGlobal accessibility\nFirst-hand, personal experiences\nUnlimited networking opportunities\nLike-minded community\n\nAs part of this platform, MetaTrekkers will develop a dedicated center in Decentraland, with a total surface of 9 parcels, which will provide multiple settings and environments designed to cater to the specific educational requirements of any topic presented by our guest speakers.\n\nWe strongly believe that the long-term success of the metaverse depends on proving it’s a stable environment that provides its users with valuable tools and means to expand their knowledge, and a long list of opportunities for self and professional development.\n\nWhat makes our proposal unique in the web3 educational space is an innovative concept which we like to call the Institute for Decentralized Education Opportunities (IDEO) – a fully decentralized organization where the users can take on an active role in the educational process by voting on topics, speakers and activities, and engaging in interactive learning experiences.\n\nBeing a long-term project, the education platform will also include a program that rewards attendance, activity and involvement with education-related NFT giveaways, job opportunities and exclusive experiences. This rewards program will employ the support and collaboration of many other venues, projects and organizations, from both Decentraland and outside the metaverse. In addition, MetaTrekkers is currently in the process of securing partnerships with organizations like the Texas Blockchain Council, which would translate into access to real-world summits, seminars and sessions where platform users would benefit from exclusive networking opportunities and access.\n\nEstablishing Decentraland as an environment that not only supports its community’s development but provides the actual educational resources to achieve such growth, is a technique that can reach a large audience and help onboard and transform them into highly active Decentraland users.\n\nGiven the nature of this initiative, MetaTrekkers is currently seeking to obtain TEDx certification as an official partner for the metaverse, thus adding considerable value and credibility to this space, and paving the road for the launch of the educational platform.\n\nWith the funds from the grant, MetaTrekkers will develop and market the platform, and will compensate the speakers.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nIn order to put the plan in motion, MetaTrekkers has already started taking action towards the development of the education platform.\n\nFirst of all, while we’re waiting for an official response on our TEDx application, MetaTrekkers has begun the process of applying to other academic talks platforms in the effort to guarantee an exclusive educational experience to Decentraland users.\n\nTo ensure a successful result for this initiative, MetaTrekkers will develop its own program, within the IDEO platform, which will feature metaverse streaming services for a host of seminars, courses, and other academic sessions.\n\nIn addition to the value we’re bringing to the existing Decentraland community, we’ll also be taking care of injecting new visitors and users into the Decentraland world. This will happen by constantly engaging with new audiences through our favorite tool – The MetaTrekkers Onboarding Program, composed of four steps:\n\n*   Onboarding speakers\n\n*   Onboarding speakers’ fanbase\n\n*   Exclusive Decentraland tours for speakers and fan base\n\n*   Speakers will lead an extra talk/session on the confirmed onboarding date\n\nThe first step towards developing this education platform is hosting the “Dia de los Muertos” event at the MetaTrekkers Club venue, where Decentraland users and visitors will be able to discover and learn about the customs and traditions of one of Mexico’s most important holidays of the year. The event, led by none other than VJ Deliria, is set to educate guests through NFT art, music and direct engagement, about the rich culture surrounding this day of celebration.\n\nAnother successful step we’ve taken is to secure a strategic partnership with DCENTRAL CON, through which we’ve gained exclusive rights to stream the November 28-30 Miami event at the MetaTrekkers Club in Decentraland. This will already translate into an influx of new visitors and users, composed of an audience unable to attend the event in person. If we take a look at last year’s numbers, the NFT convention reached an in-person attendance of more than 5,000 individuals, with many more seeking a means to participate virtually. Just to get an idea of the importance of this conference, here are a few speakers who will be engaging the audience: Baron Davis (NBA), Michael Blank (Polygon), Anastasia Drinevskaya (Cointelegraph).\n\nOne of MetaTrekkers community’s advantages is that its founder, Chris Oniya, is also Texas Blockchain Council’s (TBC) ambassador for Houston. For the Decentraland community, this means that Lee Bratcher, Founder and President of TBC, will be one of the first speakers to engage with the IDEO users.\n\nAnother key speaker that will headline one of the main events of the educational platform will be Lennox Matsinde, co-founder of Satoshi’s Index and Product Manager at Starbucks Corporate – one of the latest additions on the list of big brands actively exploring the opportunities of metaverse representation.\n\nYu-Kai Chou, a crowd favorite, is the creator of the Octalysis framework, a keynote speaker on our education platform, and regarded as #1 Gamification Gurus. His work in the field of gamification is linked to substantial improvements in the experience of over 1 billion users.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nDirectory: https://bit.ly/3Um9mFx\n\nThe team of professionals responsible for the development, launching and marketing of the educational platform:\n\nChris Oniya, MetaTrekkers Founder\n\nJim Flint, Local Search Group Digital Marketing, Founder and President\n\nJulia, Web3 Educational Advisor\n\nChris West, Digital Marketing Specialist\n\nSwivel Meta, Metaverse Development\n\nMelanie Girald, Strategic Planning Consultant\n\nJulio Balbueno, Strategic Planning Consultant\n\nSynthia Nominae, Metaverse Onboard Lead\n\nJay Vee - Project Manager\n\nJulie Anne - Administrative Assistant\n\nPsyche - Social Media Coordinator\n\nNeo - Video Editor Assistant\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe initial stage of the project implies the development, marketing and launching of the platform, including hosting a minimum 15 educational events featuring at least 15 keynote speakers.\n\nStarting at the beginning of the year 2023 we’ll deploy the development tasks to our team of professionals, while the month of February will kick off the first series of seminars, sessions and talks.\n\n2022\n\n*   Exclusive streaming of the TBC Summit\n\n*   Women of Web3 Summit\n\n*   DCentral Con Miami\n\n*   Maxing Out Your Meta-Con Experience Conference\n\nJanuary 2023\n\n*   Development of the educational platform begins\n\n*   Pre-launch, marketing campaign\n\nFebruary\n\n*   Development of the platform ends\n\n*   First educational sessions hosted in Decentraland, complete with 4-step onboarding program\n\n*   Bloomberg/Forbes news article about the launch of the platform.

    "title": "35+ Opensource Scenes and Assets for the Community by MrDhingia (Revised)",
    "body": "> by 0x447c9058be5c164e0c4aae380381e7a5215052d4 (MrDhingia)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\n**Problem:** Development of 3D structures on the land is the major bottleneck in creating experiences on Decentraland. Many creators/individuals holding land with great ideas don’t have funds or skill sets to build the structure themselves. To solve this, we want to offer our services to the community.\n\n**Proposal:** Dhingia Builds wants to create 35+ stunning builds in various parcel sizes for the community. The community of Decentraland will be able to make use of these builds for free. Those who own land can use and deploy these builds on their parcels.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x447C9058bE5c164e0c4aae380381e7A5215052D4\n\n## Email address\n\ncontact@mrdhingia.com\n\n## Description\n\nDhingia Builds founded by Mr. Dhingia is a team of young passionate builders and coders who have worked on 30+ projects and Individuals in Decentraland. Together the team wants to make it easier for users to build structures and make fully active spots by themselves. Users and landowners in Decentraland will benefit directly from this proposal. We offer unique build designs that can be used for free by everyone in Decentraland.\n\n**Some of the projects developed by MrDhingia**\n\nApes 3D (103,150)\nBverse (-30,-108)\nVoxboards (142,-146)\nPeanutbutta  (-108,-95)\nWilderness (old build)\nCryptoNovo’s Novoverse (23,69)\nHaus Of Daybed (124,-15)\nDJ Category 5 Yacht Club  (-63,-111)\nGremlin Society (31,-116)\nDhingia Club (144,-148)\nHousi Casa (-70,42)\nDoctorD Club (-91,-21)\nZevi G (-21,-53)\nEashoo Law (-101,-63)\nMetaTron - (-150,-144)\nKandy Girl - (-55,-129)\nSlavik Fruit Farm (161,92)\nAfro Build (134,-141)\nCastle Zeitgeist (136,-141)\nCommunity Green Screen (143,-149)\nBusiness Centre (142,-143)\nLadies Lounge (6,-47)\nNCPI - A Government of India Project in DCL.\nDhingia Festive Build (Deployed on Cultural festivals)\nDhingia Exhibition Booth (-90,26)\nNovoverse Halloween Build\nTriverr Showroom\nRacing Punks Showroom\nSome builds are designed on NDA contracts.\n\n**Pros to Decentraland:**\n\nThe owner of a parcel can start some activity without the hassle of building a structure.\nThis proposal will revitalize dead lands and increase engagement as it would be a hassle-free process to deploy scenes/ builds.\n\nThese builds can be used by several users who are doing events and need a better build.\nThe builds will include 1x1, 2x1, 2x2 (Clubs with SDK), offices, headquarters, NFT Galleries, and 3x3 event spaces, and concert stage.\nThis will lead to more engagement on the platform since there will be multiple active scenes.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Build Features:**\n\nBuilds will have striking and distinctive designs. Some builds will have copies in various textures and theme. For instance: Build A will have color options and textures like A1, A2, A3. Decentraland norms and specifications will be followed when building.  Builds will have various size options. Builds will have the facility of light, interiors and elevators. Builds can be customized using DCL builder. Builds will be within triangle limits and SDK friendly. Builds will have perfect collisions and layout for movement.\n\nBuilds are fully functional and can be customized by USER based on an individual's needs and project requirements. Comes with an instruction video “How to deploy the scene?”. We will also provide a series of videos detailing how to place the build on land, install other GLB files, assets, and other general SDK features to make the build more functional. Also, the videos for editing the Game.ts and Scene.json files and setting up the build for deploying on the land parcel. A special discord and website will be developed for distributing these builds to the community.\n\n**10 Projects/Individuals get custom build who are active in the community and deliver value to the platform.**\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nMr. Dhingia Personal: I Joined DCL in Nov 2021, as a Decentraland builder, I have built 3D architecture for projects and individuals. I own/operate Dhingia Club (144,-148) and . Dhingia club hosts many events including birthday parties, cultural events, and launch parties for builds.

    "body": "> by 0xaca8fbbdddfce169114f344d8ee739bde665f4f4 (Seanny)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should we temporarily pause DCL's grants programme until Q1 2023?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c8aa85b0-65e8-11ed-bf97-7dbf9f54c71d)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis draft proposal is a continuation of the already approved poll calling for a temporary pause in the Decentraland grants system.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\n\\[Please refer to this poll https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c8aa85b0-65e8-11ed-bf97-7dbf9f54c71d to remain up to date on this decision]\n\nThe poll setting this draft proposal led to open dialogue where multiple different members of the community brought opinions, information and value to the table, aimed at debating this proposal.\n\nIn spirit of agency, this draft proposal aims to add more of a focus on the question at hand:\n\n> Should we temporarily pause DCL's grants programme until Q1 2023?\n\nThrough this proposal, we wish to propose the following action points:\n\n*   Temporarily pause the uptake of new grant proposals;\n*   Ensure the pause does not negatively harm the creative community;\n*   Reach a consensus on the potential pause itself;\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nGovernance is a fundamental part of our DAO, and a *two-month* pause in our grants system can give the DCL Community a chance to turn its energy toward passing a multitude of upcoming governance decisions.\n\nThe record for the highest-voted draft proposal was 103 votes. The average amount of votes achieved across all our draft proposals is 51.\n\nOn the horizon, we have upcoming decisions for:\n\n*   Restructuring of the Community Grants Program:\n    https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e2fbd710-426c-11ed-9eb2-21be7ab68113\n*   Grant Revocation Committee:\n    https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ced918f0-6b85-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598\n*   Implementing a Bidding and Tendering process:\\\n    https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ce730570-6053-11ed-bf97-7dbf9f54c71d\n*   Denomination of Names:\n    https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2ad02720-6f1e-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598\n*   Land Concessions:\n    https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=cb5488d0-5399-11ed-be45-c5d5549af004\n\n*...and that's just to point out a few.*\n\nAll debates, discussions, and interests aside; this proposal reaffirms the belief that voting on grants requires constant, arduous contributions to the DAO; at the expense of attention, time, and energy. A pause in voting on grant-focused decisions is an opportunity for delegates and voters to *breathe* and take stock of all the decisions they have taken over the past months.\n\nAs DAO voters, we must also have time to pause and look back at the stands we have taken, with the curiosity of knowing how our decisions played out over time.\n\nRemember; within a DAO, you are far more similar to a parliamentarian than you are to a citizen within a state. Decision fatigue is a serious risk, that we would be intelligent to avoid.\n\nA pause in our grants system is the perfect opportunity to both reflect on our past decisions, whilst also shifting our collective focus on the most important decisions we have to collectively make.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Proposed Plan of Action**\n\nThe Final Governance vote must be *BEFORE* the 20th of December, 2022.\n\nCurrent open grants remain *unaffected* by this pause.\n\nThe pause will only remain in effect for a maximum of **TWO** months.\n\nThe pause must cause as little disruption as possible to the creative community. This draft proposal can serve as a potential initial notice on the dates and potential plans for the pause, should the proposal pass.\n\nThis draft is to feed into a final governance proposal, which shall outline the entire step-by-step process with clarity and ease, whilst also outlining the different responsibilities related to the decision (such as who will be implementing the pause on the backend).\n\n**Proposed Timeline:**\n\n> Last day to submit a grant proposal: **24th December,** 2022 23:59PM EST\n\n> Last day to vote on a grant proposal: **31st December,** 2022 23:59PM EST\n\n> Grant Programme Pause \\[no votes on grants; full focus on governance]: **1st January,** 2023, 00:00AM EST\n\n> Grant Programme Resume: **1st March,** 2023, 00:00AM EST\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe intended outcome of this entire proposal is to continue building on the great discussions had in the last poll, with the ultimate aim of gathering the community together to focus on governance-based decision-making.\n\nA pause in voting for grants can be the perfect moment for us to enter the new year with both energy and conviction to make 2023 the best year for DCL yet.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2b2a3f40-7035-11ed-beaf-a14520403f7b)**",

    "title": "DCLPanel: let’s take events to a next level, 100% free, Open Source ( and also *HIRING*)",
    "body": "> by 0x664eabe08871a7b7f13ade88bc34605ed5eaeae6 (Tobik)\n\nHello, community. I see a big part of the community working on games, and while I think it’s great, I think we are missing one of the most important activities: events.\n\nThe thing with events is that there is a lot of potential that can be unlocked but we are most of the time doing the same thing: a streaming screen and a musician. And if that was not enough, we also enable auto-dance, one of the most (in my opinion) pathetic implementations that it’s just another way of faking interaction.\n\nHow is possible we have this 3D environment where we could allow tons of interactions, and all we do is stand in front of a screen? It makes no sense.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why this is happening: one could be that some people are too comfortable to innovate and the other one is that it’s extremely hard from a technical perspective if you are not a developer. Believe it or not, there are multiple events that are being hosted by non-techie people, using the builder.\n\nWith this idea in mind, the point here is to basically create a web panel where ANYONE can manage his land and create different narratives through interaction. It needs to have a bunch of features integrated such as teleporting, spin wheels, streaming, and more.\n\nIt also needs to be modular and let anyone create their own plugins. Also, we need to make sure it’s possible to install it using the builder (through smart items) and needs to be 100% free and Open Source so anyone can install it on their own server. But: I would also like to publish a hosted version on my website just to make sure it’s accessible to anyone who doesn’t know how to host it. In that sense, the DAO needs to cover all the server costs of this too.\n\nI think we can start with 6 basic tools: teleport (you can teleport a player to specific coords inside your scene),  message (to display an announcement in the middle of the screen), spin wheel (this could be useful for giveaways or to take random decisions), countdown (to enable a countdown inside DCL), screen (to manage a screen inside DCL) and a poll so people can vote.\n\nAfter we achieve this basic stuff, we add more stuff:\n\nDiscord integrations with your DCL scene\nControlling lights inside your scene to make a show of lights that could be awesome with a DJ\nThe possibility of extracting the chat of your scene and adding it to your stream so you can also display it on Twitch/YouTube.\n\nThere are tons of things we can achieve. And by making this 100% free and idiot-proof, we should be able to convince almost everyone who hosts events to start using it.\n\nIf a feature cannot be integrated due to Decentraland limitations, we can also find developers who push code to GitHub, but in general, the vast majority of ideas can be implemented right now.\n\nNow, how do we pay for this? using the DAO. I already have enough contacts to make it pass, I just need to create a team who wants to build this. Everyone will get compensated, and at the same time, we improve this platform a lot.\n\nThis is also can be a good precedent for doing changes through the DAO and not waiting for The Foundation to solve them.\n\nThere is no need to create a business model here, the money will come from the people who host events. By making them better, more people should stay here.\n\nI need people interested in collaborating (developers, mostly) >>>\nhttps://unve.rs/discord\n\nA good thing is that most of the features I want to add are scattered across multiple GitHub repositories.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/pnT2F65.png\n\nP.S.: sorry for the *hiring* clickbait, it’s partially true.\nP.S. (2):  It should also be possible to give access to your personal panel to other members. Maybe we can also implement a permission system where you can create roles so another user is only allowed to spin the wheel, for example.\nP.S. (3): one last time: 100% idiot-proof, free and Open Source.\n\n- Cool idea, I support it 😎\n- This is crap 😂\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ac4ef4b0-6c81-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598)**",

    "body": "> by 0x858343382132b9ab46c857a7d52fdbafc039f784 (Zino)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Who should make the decision of revoking grants?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=823c92e0-2ad2-11ed-ac99-5bece7edccd0)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to create the structure and guidelines for the New Committee who decides when to revoke grants, to function effectively\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nFollowing a nurturing discussion on a [previous draft](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fca083a0-595a-11ed-be45-c5d5549af004), the community saw it necessary to split the creation of a New Committee into two steps:\n\n*   One with the structure and guidelines for the New Committee who decides when a grant should be revoked.\n*   Another after the framework is designed, to propose the Committee members.\n    This is a next step towards defining this framework.\n\nTo unify criteria we´ve used this [Governance Proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)  as a starting point to include the procedure to create this new Committee and to add and remove a Committee member.\nDue to the character limitations, you can find more information about this [framework here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1Cm8pfd3uCWYf8TuUXnWyCnp8WFP_uunEDHsKuIlnmLw/edit).\n\nThe New Committee will have the sole responsibility to order the revocation of a Grant provided by the Decentraland DAO.\nThis New Committee is important to decentralize the decision-making process of determining which grants should be revoked and to take care of the DAO treasury. If this draft proposal passes, the path to revocations would be the following:\n\n1.  The Grant Support Squad makes a recommendation to the New Committee to review a case when the grantee doesn't comply with the terms and conditions and the Grant Framework.\n2.  The New Committee of 5 members will study each case and will have the opportunity to request extra information regarding the case presented, and has the responsibility to provide a resolution to the community, either to revoke a grant or not to revoke a grant.\n3.  If a grant should be revoked, the DAO committee will execute the revocation.\n\nThe New Committee will be constituted by 5 members and 2 substitutes.  This committee selected by the Decentraland DAO Community is expected to be in office for twelve (12) months and the members could be re-elected only for one consecutive period.\nEach committee member will be compensated with 200 USD in MANA per grant case,  paid by the DAO treasury and executed by the DAO committee once the verdict has been posted on the Grant Proposal page.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDuring the 5 months that the Grants Support Squad has been active, we got to know the grantees on video calls, spent time with them, listened to their needs, provided support in various forms, and have seen successful grants. Walking through those [58 grants that finished ($3.5MUSD)](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7a236540-d305-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0) before the Grant Support Squad existed, we detected that 17 grants had some concerns regarding what they had first stated in their proposal and the finished projects. This represents 1,3M USD, almost 50% of the funds provided.\n\nIn the current active grants, we found cases where those grants were not able to complete the project that the community had voted on, and some other projects that were delayed on the proposed roadmap. The difficulty in these cases is that the contracts of these grants were still vesting, without clarity regarding their ability to complete them successfully.\n\nFor that reason, we recommended the DAO Committee (who has the ability to stop the vesting contracts using the contract action “revoke”), should execute the only technical mechanism that the DAO has to make sure those vesting contracts were stopped, as a preventive action. As soon as the grantee delivered according to their proposed roadmap, the DAO Committee also took the commitment to create a new vesting contract for the funds remaining.\n\nThe Grant Support Squad has started to work on the improvement of the Grants Program, particularly finding tools to mitigate the negative impact that the revocation has on the grantees.\n\nThis New Committee proposal would give an opportunity to the grantees to argue during the “revocation process”. This would mitigate the “centralized power” of the DAO Committee to judge the case, and execute the decision.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**To create this New Committee and to add a member:**\n\n1.  There will be an open application period in the forum (like the community [has done](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-for-delegates-apply-now/5840) in the past and is doing with the [new DAO Committee member](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569)). Applications will be submitted by the prospects as posts on the forum and applicants should answer the questions [mentioned in the complete framework document - art. 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cm8pfd3uCWYf8TuUXnWyCnp8WFP_uunEDHsKuIlnmLw/edit#heading=h.bu4jlg3b8o57).\n2.  The Grant Support Squad interviews the candidates and makes a final selection of 5 members and 2 substitutes. **For the creation of this committee and its renewals**, the final selection will be presented to the community in a poll.\n3.  There will be a final poll for the community to vote to accept or decline this selection. This process will be repeated when the committee is renewed.\n    **Once this committee is created**, the process for adding a new committee member if there is a vacancy will include these 3 stages: I) An Open Call is published in the forum in charge of the Grant Support Squad, II) The committee in office interviews the candidates for the vacant position and makes a final selection of the potential member from the applicants, III) and the community votes in a poll for the best fit.\n\n**To remove a member:**\n\nFollowing the DAO Committee framework, the DAO should add a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal category with the required parameters mentioned [in the complete framework document - art. 3](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1Cm8pfd3uCWYf8TuUXnWyCnp8WFP_uunEDHsKuIlnmLw/edit).\n\n1.  A member could be removed by an Internal decision of the Committee members.\n2.  A member could be removed by the community creating a proposal, and a simple majority vote would be needed to make it effective.\n\n**Procedure**\n\n1.  The New Committee starts to act when there is a [formal request from the community through a form](https://forms.gle/UGF1wj9ueHzvWGPN8).\n2.  The Grant Support Squad will request the grantee to respond to the concerns raised within 4 days.\n3.  After that, The Grant Support Squad will send, in the course of following 4 days, the arguments for the New Committee to evaluate the case. This triggers a preventive revocation, later to be executed by the DAO committee.\n4.  Then, the New Committee has 6 days to discuss the case among the 5 members.\n5.  During the period of 6 days, the New Committee has the ability to request further information to the Grant Support Squad or the Grantee about the case presented, not exceeding 30 days.\n6.  After that, the New Committee has 5 days to publish the final resolution.\n\n**Conflicts of interest.**\n\nAny member of the New Committee should be prevented from participating in a case according to the cases that are mentioned in the [complete framework document - art. 7](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cm8pfd3uCWYf8TuUXnWyCnp8WFP_uunEDHsKuIlnmLw/edit)\n\n**Execution.**\n\nThe New Committee will reach the final decision by simple majority.\nThe resolution should be clear and public with the committee’s arguments on why the grant should/should not be revoked.\nThe Final decision will be notified on Grant’s proposal page as a comment and on Grant’s dedicated discord channel.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith this draft proposal we aim to gather feedback and inputs from the community regarding this proposed framework with the objective of creating a final governance proposal that includes the vision and needs of our grantees and the community.\nPlease feel free to add any comments and suggestions to the [complete framework document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cm8pfd3uCWYf8TuUXnWyCnp8WFP_uunEDHsKuIlnmLw/edit)\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ced918f0-6b85-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598)**",

    "title": "Should VP keep assigned to the landowner in a LAND Rental transaction?",
    "body": "> by 0x87956abc4078a0cc3b89b419928b857b8af826ed (Nacho)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should VP be delegated in a LAND Rental transaction?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b21c30c0-5af6-11ed-8d3a-4fd4826afe14)\n\n## Summary\n\nFormalize the mechanism to assign Voting Power in a LAND Rental transaction making sure the VP stays assigned to the LAND owner wallet and it’s not lost or assigned to the renter in the transaction.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal promotes to the next governance stage the outcome decided by the community on the previously published poll regarding Voting Power assignation in the new LAND Rental protocol being built by the Decentraland Foundation.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, there are multiple LAND Rental protocols created by the community but by using them, every time a LAND or Estate is rented, a smart contract functions as the escrow of the asset. Therefore, the asset owner is the Rental smart contract, and that Voting Power (VP) gets “lost”. In other words, that VP will be assigned to the Rental smart contract who cannot possibly vote or do anything on the DAO. We need a strategy to assign the VP to the renter’s wallet to fix this. We need to ensure that in the ideal case of renting is a widely used strategy in the Decentraland ecosystem, the circulating Voting Power is not retired from circulation.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation has already created a Snapshot strategy to keep the VP as the owner of the LANDs and Estates.\n\nThe way this would work is that whenever a rental starts and the NFT is transferred to the Rentals contract, a new entity in the Rentals subgraph is created called RentalAsset that keeps track of the lessor (original owner), the contract address, and the tokenId of that NFT, as well as whether the NFT has been claimed back from the contract.\nGiven a list of user addresses, the strategy first queries the Rentals subgraph to obtain all RentalAssets that have the provided addresses as lessors. For example, if the list contains User 1 and User 2, it will look for all RentalAssets where User 1 and User 2 are lessors.\nFor the rental assets that correspond to Lands, the strategy will give VP for their lessors determined by the multiplier determined by configuration. For example, if 5 of the obtained rental assets are Lands where User 2 is the lessor, User 2 will be given 5 \\* multiplier of VP.\nAn extra step is required for the rental assets that correspond to Estates. As VP for Estates is determined by the size of the Estate, we need a way to obtain that information, as the rental asset does not provide it.\nSo for each rental asset that is an Estate, the strategy will query the Marketplace subgraph to obtain their sizes, once the data is obtained, the strategy will give VP for their lessors determined by their sizes and a multiplier determined by configuration. For example, if User 2 has 2 rental assets that are Estates that both have 10 Lands each, User 2 will be given a 2 \\* 10 \\* multiplier of VP.\n\nYou can check the strategy [here](\\[https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/tree/master/src/strategies/decentraland-rental-lessors]\\(https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/tree/master/src/strategies/decentraland-rental-lessors\\))\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLAND Rental is fundamental for the Decentraland ecosystem because it will allow content creators and Metaverse builders to get access to LAND without having to buy it. By making sure the reference rental protocol created by the Decentraland Foundation does not reduce the circulating Voting Power in the DAO we are strengthening our governance mechanisms\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bfe67a00-6b4d-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598)**",

    "body": "> by 0xa21de68ec34bc163cb1b84504419aa82c73ca8dd (Anaplays)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe are launching the first service for moving brand collections to DCL for digital fashion enthusiasts and contributors. Our service will simplify creating digital collections from physical ones and immediately transfer them to DCL. The entire procedure for one collection will take a maximum of one week (our goal is a few days) and will replenish the DCL market with a large quantity of fashionable and high-quality wearables at affordable prices.\nSeamm is a mobile app that stores and transfers digital collections to metaverses and video games. The current stage of development includes the feature transfer to DCL. Our team requires resources to optimize the speed of digitizing brand collections and publishing them on the DCL marketplace.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x0F8a07Cd05AA48fBB5aBEd5EaEfBcA8AF49b5B4C\n\n## Email address\n\npartnership@seamm.io\n\n## Description\n\nBrands desire to sell and market their garments and accessories in DCL, but frequently lack the knowledge and resources to do it quickly and effectively. Players in Decentraland desire to be able to purchase and wear trendy and cool wearables in DCL, however the marketplace's existing selection of wearables is characterized by sporadic, restricted releases from brands and generally prohibitive pricing. Our service will assist in bridging the gap between businesses and their audiences in order to enrich the material for the DCL marketplace and promote digital collections of brands with minimal effort.\nBrands will obtain a new channel for the quick and professional distribution of their fashion collections, while the DCL community will have access to a diverse selection of high-quality content (wearables and accessories) at a reasonable price.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe will construct more integration with the DCL API using the subsequent processes and combine it with the existing mobile application. To start we’ll work with three brands for\nProcesses:\n\n*   Create a collection\n*   Collection moderation\n*   Transfer\n    The project will involve the development of a server application and database to hold digital collections of brand names. We have already signed contracts with seven brands willing to digitize one item from their collections for inclusion in our initiative.\n    The finished solution will contain all required production-ready features, such as data security and encryption, as well as, if necessary, at least two server applications operating for failover/redundancy.\n    The first phase of the project will concentrate on server construction, 3D modeling (7 items), and UI/UX design,  while the second phase will involve integration with DCL API (or a possible way to connect directly).\n    The objective is to expand the number of brands with wearable collections and content and to generate greater market activity by offering a vast selection of outfits and accessories.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nWith a team from the fashion, technology, and gaming industries, Seamm cultivates a space to create, experiment, and release inhibitions.\nThe software engineers that have already published two versions of our core application will be a part of the new service development team. The UI/UX designer has a portfolio of successful fashion brand projects. Our 3D artists have launched wearables collections on the DCL marketplace for brands and have experience creating 3D models that adhere to constraints and optimize all needs. Business Development - 20+ years in the fashion industry (e.g., Bottega Veneta, Moschino, TSUM).\nOur crew is intimately familiar with the challenges that every brand has while designing collections for DCL. As players in DCL, our team members are familiar with the frustrations of consumers when the market for wearables is limited. Therefore, we are prepared to resolve this issue and propose a universal answer for both parties.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nPhase 1 features:\n\n*   Collecting technical requirements for DCL API integration\n*   UI/UX design and features\n*   Creation of 3D-models (7 items)\n    Total estimated time: 80 hours\n    Phase 1 extra features:\n*   Approve collection\n*   Implementation of comments and fixing in the interface\n\nTotal estimated time: 20 hours\n\nPhase 2 Features:\n\n*   Transfer process and approve\n*   Integration with DCL API\n*   Publishing in the DCL marketplace\n\nTotal estimated time: 40 hours\n\nTotal Project Estimated 140 hours\n\nDev budget 40k\nDesign and 3D-artists budget 20k\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=79869460-6a34-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598)**",

Each with their own tools, dapps, communities, founders, developers and financial ecosystems. A lot of these projects are building stuff that can be integrated into decentraland.\\\n\\\nLater this month I will be doing an event to showcase https://talisman.xyz\n(A non-profit metamask alternative that can already be used to log in to decentraland and access polkadot and ethereum data at the same time.. *-Drops mic-* )\\\nhttps://twitter.com/coinatomy/status/1594690826617200642/\n\\\n\\\n**How this benefits Decentraland?**\\\nOver the next couple of months I will be hosting events for individual parachains. DCL will receive more attention from the polkadot community resulting in more active users through organic marketing and more tools being built for decentraland. Polkadot has around 15,000 active developers and I plan to reach out to as many as possible, to see if they are interested in contributing..\nI've been involved in polkadot since 2016 and developed good relationships with a lot of polkadot/kusama brands. But with a new ecosystem being added every other week it is becoming hard to keep up with all the developer activity. So I want to bring them all together and show them why decentraland is the best metaverse on the market.\\\n\\\n**So what have we BUITL so far?**\\\nUNO (Which I will opensource)\\\nA Quiz system for inputting/approving/viewing questions..\\\nMaze (Ready for some paintball?)\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**What we want to build next?**\\\n**1.** So we want to allow cross chain transactions in-game from polkadot. This is considerably harder than polygon because most of polkadot is not EVM compatible. So our plan is to build a substrate pallet that can be added to an existing parachain like a piece of lego. Then we can work with the talisman code to build a kinda dot-connect (similar to the widely popular eth-connect) which should allow polkadot transactions in-game.\\\n**2.** The quiz we've **BUITL** is a really good tool for education. I would like to get all of the dot communities to submit good questions and answers about their projects so that we can expand the consciousness of education. Things we would like to include are; NFTs, games, competitions, leaderboards and more. Sure, we're open to suggestions.\\\n**3.** Paintball\\\n**4.** Once the above is completed we want to start working on a polkadot L2 in-game marketplace!\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**Who?**\\\n*Butter#4840* - Been promoting DCL since launch. Doing events on my own since May 2020. With the most notable being Keep Networks hackathon in Sept 2020 which received 2.2m views from 50,000 unique addresses.. Since then I've been doing smaller events for individual companies and projects.\\\n*Binh* - WSS/Backend stuff. Can build anything.\\\n*Max* - Graphic designer recently aquired. \\\\\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Budget?**\\\nCurrently I've spent about $25k on the quiz and UNO.\\\nAnd it will take about $30k to build a substrate pallet and dot-connect.\\\n\\\n**Why proposal?**\\\nAs you can see we're hitting new development milestones every day. Up until now I have been paying for everything myself. Cross-chain transactions is something that everyone will benefit from and it doesn't make sense to have to pay for everything myself.\\\n\\\n**So let's get it BUITL!**\\\nhttps://BUITL.com\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1c5a5390-69a7-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598)**",

    "body": "> by 0x0a05a8a135e3d1f035819dadb4484f74b104a346 (Crusty)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nNPACT (npact-village.com) focuses on community growth, research, and adaptation of Decentraland as our mission. With metaverses and gaming experiences evolving towards full Virtual Reality (VR)  we investigate potential effects of this transition. Virtual reality and sports will continue to grow recreationally, professionally, and medically, however biomedical research has yet to evaluate the impact of this new VR technology, as ethical and health concerns arise. This grant provides a scientific investigation of potential dangers and benefits of VR integration into the metaverse. Our expert teams of Medical Practitioners, Researchers and Decentraland community members seek to answer these questions.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x0A05A8A135E3D1F035819daDb4484f74b104A346\n\n## Email address\n\ninfo@npact-village.com\n\n## Description\n\nWe spend an increasing amount of our daily life in the digital environment. This is not a new thing, but the ability to meet social, work, educational, cultural, and even IRL maintenance without ever leaving your computer exploded in post-covid. With this explosion of work from home coupled with tradition gym closures and technologically leverage products like Peloton reaching mass adoption, the future partnership of exercise and the metaverse finally moved beyond its perpetually nascent phase.\n\nTo say it has reached full adoption, or is technically proficient as desired, would be taking great liberty with the truth. However, while the technology is lagging, the social structure of sports, includes its competitive nature, are taking subtle but significant steps. Beyond a traditional leader board displaying a name and temporary high score, individualized avatar athletes provide recognition, branding, and the under pinning of the tribal mentality associated with sports rivalries.\n\nDigital uniforms and team names and identities which under tradition are regionally formed, with specialized equipment and sponsorship following, has been turned on its head. In contrast, factors including time zones, preferred equipment, technological compatibility and political affiliations are component parts of the whole. While not the focus of this project, these factors must be considered during any ethical design review process. As these factors could lead to over exertion and injury in any environment, we will endeavor to identify and isolate their direct impact on the metaverse based virtual gaming environment.\n\nAs discussed above, home exercise has moved leaps and bounds from aerobic types of yesteryear. Now, instead of being led by the recording, we are now recording the leader. However, that leader is not always human and classes give way for competition on a more regular basis. Without the unpredictability of inclement weather, cost of ravel, ongoing communication, and generally large time commitment associated with organized sporting events, more frequent and bespoke functions are possible.\n\nRanging from a group of friends virtually cycling together to an esports arena teaming with thousands, virtual reality and sports will continue to grow recreationally, professionally, and medically. Biomedical research and implementation while quite conspicuous with the Invictus games, the impact of tech many not be as obvious in character design and movement. For example, at one of the most simple designs, an underwater adventure game, while perfectly safe for the human behind the goggles, would spell destruction if replicated in the real world. While seemingly far-fetched and low-hanging fruit as an example, it speaks to a potentially increasing problem, realism in avatar function and design. Even the greatest suspension of reality would have difficulty reasonably finding a gamer trying to fly off a building as a dragon. But could the same be said for a human gamer trying to imitate a Tetris style climbing game in the real world if digitally designed? In light of the multiple injuries suffered each year in pursuit of social media challenges like the mild crate climb, these risks become increasingly foreseeable. Simply put, as the likeness to human increases in avatar, does the risk of injury though imitation on competition simply increase?\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Research question\n\nTo what degree, if any, does an omnidirectional sporting device and combination with virtual reality increase the risk of injury to the participant?\n\n### Sub Questions\n\n1.  To what degree, if any, does the underlying physical condition of a participant contribute to risk?\n2.  To what degree if any are risks associated with physical condition mitigated or warned against by manufactures?\n3.  To what degree of commonality, if any, will new omnidirectional related injuries occur?\n    What are the most likely injuries?\n4.  To what degree, if any, does the environmental design of the game enhance risk of injury?\n5.  To what degree, if any, does the design and functionality of the avatar enhance risk of injury?\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nIt is our belief that game designers did not properly anticipate the incongruity of digital physical capabilities in design, resulting in participants mimicking unnatural actions or the avatar or game requirements resulting in new sports injuries patterns or occurrences.\n\n### Design\n\nUtilizing the Kat VR Omnidirectional system in conjunction with the Oculus Rift, our participants will engage in gaming and digital sports, captured on video. Following 10 sessions to allow familiarity and ease, our lead physician researcher will review the kinetics, identify the greatest points for risk of injury. This will be correlated with the gaming interaction for design review. Following processing and correlation of all data, the highest and most common risks will be identified for further study and to offer precautions to the community at large.\n\n### Methods\n\n1.

    "body": "> by 0x538ce85ccf6080cec960bc5341787691217c4d97 (Johnny#4d97)\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nTo build a presence/scene for brand in Decentraland requires experience and is accessible mostly for skilled people so far.\n\nIn DAPPCRAFT we realized that we can lower the entry barrier into Decentraland for everyone without platform/builder experience.\n\nThis is how Instaverse was born - an easy way for everyone to bring an Instagram profile into Metaverse as an auto generated scene with a few clicks. The scene is pre-customized to profile look and feel and then deployed into Decentraland.\nInstaverse is a great tool for anyone who wants to create a Decentraland presence, regardless of their skill level. With Instaverse, anyone can easily create and access their own Decentraland world.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n116,400 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xf49056577a9266cd6CFd1B8f6ac151D9BB3671d7\n\n## Email address\n\njohnny.k@dapp-craft.com\n\n## Description\n\n### This project is going to solve:\n\n*   easy entry for influencers and bloggers to share metaverse space with friends\n*   give landowners ability to lend their land\n*   lower barrier entry to business into Decentraland\n\nInstaVerse is a platform for anyone to create amazing scene in Decentraland based on Instagram profile in 3 easy steps:\n\n![3 easy steps](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/steps.png)\nThis means that there is a larger pool of people who are able to create amazing scenes and share them with friends to hang out together.\n\n### How Instaverse is going to be self sustainable?\n\nWe are going to use the subscription model for users and charge a monthly fee for a “private residence” scene in Decentraland or place in Instaverse Tower. This will allow keeping their \"spaces\" online, similar to hosting websites in classic web20 hosting business.\nAs we have a verbal agreement with the number of landowners, we are going to start with free of charge model to attract more users.\n\n### Instaverse Tower\n\nIt is a new skyscraper scene in Decentraland that will offer an affordable space for everyone at a lower price. This is a great entry point for creators/businesses to opportunity to get involved in the Metaverse. Creators can use this space to reach a wider audience.\nIn future plans, we have a vision to have multiple towers as a scalable solution.\n\n### For Landowners\n\nLandowners can make money by leasing out their land to Instaverse and use a subscription-based system. In this system, users pay a subscription fee that allows them to use the land to host a scene. The landowner makes money from the subscriptions that are paid each month.\n\n### Long term vision\n\nIn the future, we will expand our services to work with other social networks like Facebook (Facebook pages), LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, ArtStation, Behance, and websites to create a rich and easy-to-use experience for metaverse integration.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Private Residence\n\nA 1x1 private space generated based on Instagram profile.\n\n![proccess-1](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/scene-proccess.jpg)\n![proccess-2](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/scene-proccess2.jpg)\n\n**Space customization includes:**\n\n*   Pictures gallery from Instagram feed\n*   The Stable Diffusion AI models will generate unique textures based on the profile data. This will give a personalized look and feel for a scene\n*   Instagram highlights\n\n### USERNAME AND PICTURE\n\n![custom-1](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/preview-1.jpg)\n\n### PHOTO FEED AND HIGHLIGHTS\n\n![custom-2](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/preview-2.jpg)\n\n### DIFFERENT COLOR SCHEMES WITH AI-GENERATED TEXTURES\n\n![custom-3](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/preview-3.jpg)\n\n### Instaverse Tower\n\nEach Instaverse Tower will have 4x4 size and 15 floors. This will allow providing services for about 150 owners per one spot. This will save on renting/buying land, construction costs and get beautifully designed space. In the future, it opens a variety of others gamified in exciting ways that would include all participants and their guests.\n\n### System architecture\n\n![System architecture](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/system-flow.jpg)\n\n### We are going to build architecture with the following modules:\n\n1.  **Parser** - Instagram profile scraper. We need to make sure we respect the platform restrictions.\n2.  **Color picker.** This module will figure out the main 3 colors in Instagram profile based on avatar, highlights, feed.\n3.  **AI texture generator.** Based on the main color from Instagram profile, we use Stable Diffusion which is open source and specially trained model to generate textures. Example.\n4.  **Scene assembler.** The user data (links and pictures) is applied to a 3D scene.\n5.  **Deployment module.** We are going to create automating deployment scripts. At DAPPCRAFT we already have DevOps scripts in place. We're going to reuse them and adapt in this project.\n\n***\n\n### SCENE DEMO\n\n[![preview](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/video-preview.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3nAbzjpSYT8)\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**Total team: 10 members:**\n\n*   CEO, Johnny Kartakov (LinkedIn)\n*   Chief Metaverse Officer/Product Manager, Demian G (DAPPCRAFT co-founder & CEO)\n*   COO, Dmitry Gladky (COO DAPPCRAFT)\n*   3D Lead, Chris N.,\n*   3D modeling - Ayrat Abdullaev\n*   System Architect, Sergey Drobashenko\n*   Front-end developer, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Alexander Mikhutkin\n*   Front-end developer, TypeScript - Vlad Rytov\n*   Backend developer, Python - Andrey D.\n*   DevOps, automation & monitoring - TBD\n*   Quality Assurance Engineer - TBD\n\n**Budget**\n\n*   Team compensation: $16 600 per month or a total of $99 600\n*   UI/UX (external team): $4600\n*   Servers cost for 12 months: $7400 (~$500/month with GPU support server, ~$120/month web server stack)\n*   Operational budget: $4800\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMilestone #1: 28 of February 2023.\n\n*   Landing page with 3 steps.

So he suggested that I join the development of the ecosystem with an interactive activity, have you ever seen a fish in decentraland? WHAT CAN WE DO TO CONTRIBUTE?!\nThis proposal is to fund the development of a prototype fishing model that introduces a pond with some decentralized fish waiting to be caught and adding another interactive activity for the metaverse in decentraland!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x916b441eA876B1c59084f8c9BDE233155dD14c0C\n\n## Email address\n\ndcledgar23@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nOur goal is to incorporate a new type of activity into Decentraland that provides entertainment for all kinds of people within the metaverse. This fishing activity encourages players to hunt for them. For this first stage we hope to develop through the sdk, the idea is to generate the components, basic animations and programming logic to develop the fundamentals that shape the proposed activity.\nAll our progress will be communicated through a twitter account provided here, to help the community inform about project updates by informing those interested of our activities.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe hope to carry out the development through the elaboration of controllers that allow the basic techniques of the game to be carried out in order to give concrete form to the activity. We will be using Typescript and Node Js with the relevant libraries from the sdk as well as some components of the community-provided utilities in the Utils\\* package.\nAt this moment we have some basic prototypes of the line of work with which we will begin to work with interactive mobile entities, as can be seen in this first preview:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dcl_edgar23/status/1594510218234368001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1594510218234368001%7Ctwgr%5E97eeb2e488327e2384b048e71edc2321a59802e2%7Ctwcon%5Es1\\_c10\\&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Fdcl_edgar232Fstatus2F1594510218234368001widget%3DTweet\n\nWork has been done on the controllers to animate the entities and add interactivity to the scene Simulating the fish inside a pond being caught for this stage by the cursor as shown in this video:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dcl_edgar23/status/1594510405170524169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1594510405170524169%7Ctwgr%5E3afa08282337e07d32217efb5e1ed723a65752ce%7Ctwcon%5Es1\\_c10\\&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Fdcl_edgar232Fstatus2F1594510405170524169widget%3DTweet\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nOur main programmer has been involved in development for 6 years now solving backed issues for a telecommunications company using python, flask, django, reactJs as well as nodejs with experience in project management, he will be in charge of prototype development.\nI have particularly been involved in the crypto ecosystem since the ethereum hardfork at HOMESTEAD that led to the creation of the Ethereum Classic token, involved in the early phases of the uniswap project, as well as in this project since the launch of world explorer, convinced of the need to decentralization and web3 projects that feed the metaverse to obtain as a result the attraction of a critical mass of people to the ecosystem, I will be in charge of project management, the creative process, the presentation of progress and its monitoring.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOnce the project has started, we hope to carry out the technical development throughout the rest of November and part of December 2022.

    "title": "Build an app to create wearables for decentraland without technical skills",
    "body": "> by 0x6042a0368f7bf354b44aab2fad70c4977dc24afb (MandyJennifa#4afb)\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe identified that there was no existing tool that gave users the ability to create their own clothing for the metaverse without technical 3D design skills, advanced software and expensive hardware. These constraints limit the creative output of the Decentraland community. Over the past 12 months, our team has invested capital and time in building our first version of the MOD Studio software. We are seeking to further develop the studio with specific updates to support Decentraland users. These updates will include - importing Decentraland avatar armature and wearables, creating a catalogue of 100 Decentraland wearables, and building a live editor so users can easily create 3D assets in real time.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n108,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x001A6eABE9bC521b755fE3fB879A1fcD4F1b1A2b\n\n## Email address\n\namanda@getmod.studio\n\n## Description\n\nOur mission is to empower a global community of metaverse creators through intuitive technology. The team at MOD have been working for 12 months with experts in the field to create an intuitive application that allows users to easily make 3D wearables and accessories in the simplest way. Our achievements to date include building MOD Studio, a Unity, web browser based application that enables users to select from an extensive library or upload their own wearables and easily edit textures and materials to create high quality custom assets to wear or sell in the metaverse. Users are also able to adjust the lighting, skybox image and take pictures within the studio. With MOD Studio it is quick, easy and cheap for artists and communities to bring their vision to life, while staying in full control of the creative process. The software can be trialled here: https://app.getmod.studio/\n\nWe believe our application will be invaluable to the continued success of Decentraland. It will make 3D modeling and design more accessible to the Decentraland community, including the large user base without access to technical knowledge, expensive hardware and advanced software. For example, the cost to hire a designer to make a simple item like a T-shirt, hoodie or pants starts between $50-150, with an additional fee to publish to Decentraland. This makes wearables financially inaccessible to many users. Currently, there are no transaction fees in MOD Studio. In 2023 we will be implementing small transaction fees to publish wearables created in the software. This feel will be minimal in order to keep the application accessible to everyone and attract a wide user base.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe key updates that will benefit Decentraland users include:\n\n**1. Optimize MOD Studio for Decentraland**\n\na) Import Decentraland avatar armature with wearables\n\nb) Decentraland color palette incorporated into default textures and materials\n\nc) Export wearables with 2 textures (512 x 512px)\n\nBenefits\n\n*   Simplify the process for creating Decentraland wearables while maintaining a high quality output\n*   Make creating more accessible\n*   Allow collaboration between artists and within communities\n*   Ability to easily update existing models\n\n**2. Create a catalogue of 100 wearables based on community feedback**\n\nBenefits\n\n*   Provide a wide range of wearables for artists and designers to modify\n*   Guided by Decentraland users’ feedback\n*   Hire existing Decentraland creators\n*   Reduce revisions, thereby reducing work for Decentraland DAO as all wearables will abide by the existing guidelines\n\n**3. Live editor so that users are able to create wearables in real time easily by drawing or dragging stickers - see what you’re doing, while you’re doing it.**\n\nBenefits\n\n*   Allow 2D artists to start creating in 3D\n*   Simplify the process of 3D design to make it available to everyone\n*   Not available in any other metaverse\n\nWe have determined these features based on the following feedback from testing a basic Studio we built for Decentraland (https://www.getmod.art/try-now-dcl): (1) Users were unable to import existing models and armature; (2) users had access to a limited number of wearables and requested more; and (3) users lacked the software to edit templates or found this difficult as they couldn’t see them updated on the model in real-time.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe project will be carried out by the MOD Studio team. Amanda, Robert , Zoiner and Scott will lead the project.\n\nAmanda Pope (Co-founder, Project management) - Amanda has been an active member of the Decentraland community, working closely with the Limewire team and Decentraland Foundation to bring fashion to their iconic Decentraland experiences. These include the We Set the Trends, Migos and Jim Jones debut and Limewire MVMF22.\n\nRobert Nava (Co-founder, Project Management) - Robert is an entrepreneur with over ten years of experience in Technology, Digital Sales and Marketing. Robert is immensely knowledgeable and experienced in XR, metaverse, and blockchain technology, and an active member of the Metaverse Standards Forum.\n\nZoiner Tejada (CTO, Cloud Architect) - Zoiner has more than 20 years of experience in the software industry as a software architect, CTO, and start-up CEO. He was among the first to receive a Microsoft Azure MVP (“Most Valuable Professional”) designation and has since been awarded the MVP for eight consecutive years, including a dual MVP award for Azure and Data Platform and most recently for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Additionally, he is recognized by Microsoft as a Microsoft Regional Director.\n\nScott Reed (Senior Engineer, Cloud Architect) - Scott has 30 years experience as a cloud architect, starting at IBM in 1993. Scott is responsible for the day-to-day oversight, strategy, and supervision of our technical development system and team.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**First Objective:**\n\n*   Optimize MOD Studio for Decentraland\n\n*Total estimated time: 4 weeks*\n\n**Second Objective:**\n\n*   Build the live editor\n\n*Total estimated time: 8 weeks*\n\n**Third Objective:**\n\n*   Gather feedback from the community to curate the wearables catalog\n*   Hire 3D modelers from within the Decentraland community\n*   Finalise and test catalog of wearables\n\n*Total estimated time: 4 weeks*\n\nTotal project estimated time: 12-16 weeks\n\nDesign budget: $5,000\nDevelopment budget: $90,000\nWearables creation budget: $12,000\nHosting fees: $1,000\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1bdb1f10-68c3-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598)**",

    "body": "> by 0xca5b437dbc3c7f441f99c698d4b1fe1aa0599346 (MetaParty)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nMetaParty was founded in June of 2021, our aim is to deliver exceptional experiences and events for the Decentraland community. As of date we have hosted over two hundred and fifty events to include: Metaverse Fashion Week 22, Parkour to Earn challenges, unique mini game experiences, live stream content and collaborated with DJ artists.\n\nThe MetaParty team is dedicated to consistently providing high community engagement by rendering excellent service and valuable relationships. Our aim with this proposal is to elevate MetaParty events, create the MetaParty HQ, host a minimum of 12 events per month, and create a distributed CyberStrife game within Decentraland by working with the MetaZone team.\n\nhttps://bit.ly/3EFj3dp\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xca5b437dbc3c7f441f99C698d4B1FE1AA0599346\n\n## Email address\n\nmetapartydecentral@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nOur aim with the proposal is to take MetaParty events, experiences, and CyberStrife to the next level. Funding from the DAO will enable MetaParty to develop a multifunctional space within Decentraland, where the team can increase the quality of MetaParty events. The team will conduct the following:\n\n1.  MetaParty HQ:\n    Within the MetaParty HQ we intend to host 12 events per month including, dance parties, interactive mini game challenges and sponsored events. The build will have multiple levels and a user interface allowing players to easily teleport around the parcel and take part in multiple challenges. We intend to hire established artists from within the Decentraland community and onboard artists into Decentraland to perform at events. We intend to improve upon the MetaParty HQ over time.\n\n2.  CyberStrife: RPG style Play-To-Earn game:\n    Over the past four months, our team has been working hard to develop CyberStrife, a RPG-style Play-to-Earn game. We have released multiple versions of the game into Decentraland to gain feedback from the community. MetaParty has partnered with MetaZone to improve the experience of CyberStrife, by implementing a save game feature, NFT delegation feature and distributed version of the game. By having an array of diverse experiences in Decentraland, the team believes we will retain active users and build upon our community. By using a smart contract we will repay the DAO 10% royalties of all sales of the CyberStrife game. Furthermore, 10% of all CyberStrife and MetaParty merchandise will be sent to the DAO until the grant is fully repaid.\n\n3.  Monthly Community Fashion Shows:\n    The MetaParty team aims to highlight and showcase different artists within this space through our unique “Community Fashion Show” event. Earlier this year, MetaParty worked directly with the Decentraland Foundation to host MetaVerse Fashion Week 2022 (MVFW), in which numerous artists showcase their wearables to the community. Due to the success of MVFW the MetaParty team reintroduced Community Fashion Shows, originally we asked creators within the space to sponsor the event in an effort to raise a prize pool for the audience. We realized that this model limits certain creators from participating. Moving forward Community Fashions Shows will be free of charge, and aim to capture the phenomenal work of wearable artists within this community.\n\n4.  Regular Live stream and Podcasts:\n    As active YouTube and Twitch streamers, the MetaParty team (Rezinator and FriskyBumbleBee) has been creating live content surrounding topics and organizations within the Decentraland space, showcasing many individuals and organizations within this space and their hard work in getting to where they are today. The team believes that by providing engaging content and enabling collaboration between different organizations, we can potentially onboard and attract quality users into Decentraland.\n\n5.  Cross Metaverse Hub:\n    The team will engage in community outreach to new metaverses (spatial IO in particular) and create a cross-platform hub in the MetaParty HQ. By collaborating with community leaders within Spatial IO, the team believes it will increase the organic growth of new users in Decentraland. The goal is to not only create a hub located in the MetaParty HQ but to also collaborate with Spatial IO, creating a unique build within their platform; this will create a bridge between both metaverses, allowing multiple events to happen in both Decentraland and Spatial IO.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe MetaParty team will be working directly with MetaZone, achieving the following: implementing the save game feature, NFT delegation, listing the CyberStrife game for sale as a distributed version on the MetaZone website, redesigning the UI, ensuring data integrity and improving the game experience over time. The team will also create and release new NFTs, smart wearables, and create unique player experiences through the RPG system. We aim to collaborate with other Decentraland creators to bring more interoperability to DCL and diverse experiences which the team believes will assist in scalability and retention for the platform.\n\nThe CyberStrife RPG will be available to purchase on the MetaZone website as a Meta NFT. Owners of these NFTs can deploy the CyberStrife game to their land. Game data carries over between parcels and this offers landowners an opportunity to bring more foot traffic to their parcels. As previously mentioned, 10% of all CyberStrife game sales will be sent back to the DAO via smart contract until the grant is fully repaid.\n\nBy introducing the distributed CyberStrife game we aim to expand our team over time and embark on a road of becoming self-sustainable. The team aims to provide the utmost immersive experience for all citizens in Decentraland. The team will continue to create and host unique experiences with an aim to improve upon each event.\n\nIn addition, Community Fashion Shows are popular events within the Decentraland community and have been since MetaVerse Fashion Show 2022. The team will incorporate this as a continuous event that will be hosted once a month. A new build will be created by the team for each event and all community wearable / emote creators will be invited to walk the runway and showcase their designs for no charge. A prize pool will be allocated for each event, giving players an incentive to create and post Decentraland videos to Twitter and YouTube to win prizes. Furthermore, the entire audience will be invited to walk the runway at the end of the events and showcase their favorite outfits in the “Best Dressed Challenge”.\n\nYou can watch over 110 videos focused completely on Decentraland and MetaParty via The Rezinator's YouTube channel, furthermore FriskyBumbleBee has hosted over 25 streams centered around Decentraland on twitch, re-uploading those videos to YouTube.\n\nThe Rezinator:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC73LJQ2EVw0whsh9gEKlMZQ\n\nFriskyBumbleBee:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXjejVwNdLt36N1vel66M0w/videos\n\nBudget Breakdown:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QpxdThw-p91ZzBKc5f69KCh2THd4qFKNl4rpQApTTRU/edit#gid=0\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nRezinator:\nFounder, Global Director of Business Development and Community Management\n\n•\tRezinator leads community management, project development and event hosting/planning for MetaParty.

I’d like to propose we get the ball rolling with some graphic design oriented work. Currently, there’s not enough branding materials to accommodate for most common use cases (think sponsorships, swag at conferences, presentation templates, logos for press releases or official communication, among others) which is causing these sort of needs to either not be dealt with at all or to be solved on the go, resulting in inconsistencies, lack of coherence and overall questionable quality. Decentraland as a mother brand has already had certain work done on this matter, but it is important that we give the DAO and its branding an entity of its own.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x69115B5E106E26459D8FA5741448c9396B3160aB\n\n## Email address\n\njuan.echazu@decentraland.org\n\n## Description\n\nA small, deliverables-oriented project to be executed by a graphic design and branding specialist has already been scoped and budgeted.

    "title": "$12MM Treasury Diversification",
    "body": "> by 0x11cbb078596e5100f4cbb999c5c9b69ca2ff6477 (Bronstein)\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAlastor proposes to lead a treasury diversification effort for Decentraland to diversify $12M of MANA into stables.\n\n$12M represents a 12-24 month runway for the DAO at $500k - $1M per month of grant expenditure (DCL has averaged $640k per month over the last six months, with a high of $1.1M).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x11cbB078596E5100F4cbB999c5C9b69cA2FF6477\n\n## Email address\n\nsam@alastor.ooo\n\n## Description\n\nThis summer Alastor received a grant to do an analysis on DCL's historical performance and treasury on behalf of DCL. Our analysis had a number of takeaways but our primary recommendation was to diversify MANA in the treasury into stables.\n\nOur analysis is located here: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a31bfa40-ed02-11ec-aa01-87bd234b340d\n\nSubsequently, we proposed that Alastor be appointed to lead a strategy & finance squad, with our first priority being a treasury diversification effort. This proposal was rejected.\n\nSince the release of our initial report on August 12th, the price of Mana has fallen from $1.07 to less than $0.42. To be clear, we did not predict this price drop - but our stance was simply that DCL had uncapped capital downside, putting the prospective runway of the DAO in jeopardy. What was at the time a >$200M treasury (including unvested MANA) is now worth just over $90M. A $20M diversification of vested MANA (our initial proposal outlined in our report) would have saved the DAO ~$12M in value, roughly 100x the compensation we asked for to lead this initiative.\n\nWe would like to ask DCL to once again consider our proposal. Today’s treasury (including unvested MANA) sits at ~$90M, with 99.8% of the value denominated in MANA. $18.5M of that MANA is vested, and we still believe that a large portion of that value should be diversified into stables, to prevent further value loss and to capitalize on the value DCL has created to date.\n\nDecentraland is overexposed, unhedged, and undercapitalized. This was true in August, it’s still true today.\n\nPotential counterparties for diversification include:\n\n\\-Venture Capital\n\n\\-Liquid Token Funds\n\n\\-Market Makers\n\n\\-DCA using Uniswap v3\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe will contact venture capital firms and liquid token funds to assess if there is a single buyer for the $12MM in MANA. This transaction is likely to occur at a negotiated discount to current market price, with the tokens unlocking over a negotiated period of time\n\nWe will also contact market makers and explore alternative methods for diversification, such a DCA'ing on Uniswap v3\n\nUltimately our goal will be to secure the most favorable terms for the DAO amongst the potential options\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nSam Bronstein: https://twitter.com/Sam_Bronstein\n\nJordan Stastny: https://twitter.com/jstastny101\n\nAlastor provides strategic and financial services to DAOs. Alastor has done grant work for Uniswap, Lido, Gitcoin, and others and also serves as a core contributor to Llama. Most recently, Alastor prepared a deep-dive research report for the Uniswap Foundation on their fee switch: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/alastor-fee-switch-report/18020\n\nPrior to founding Alastor, Sam & Jordan were M\\&A advisors at Qatalyst, where they advised leading technology companies on M\\&A and strategy across more than $150Bn of M\\&A and capital markets transactions, including the sales of Slack, LinkedIn, Mailchimp, Glassdoor, and others\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe would begin reach-out to counterparties in December with the goal of having a fully fleshed out diversification plan (potentially allocated across multiple counterparties and strategies, dependent upon demand). The goal would be to have the diversification fully complete by the end of  Q1 of 2023.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ef44b230-66d4-11ed-a8f3-85d147463e4c)**",

We got financed by InJesterr, Kaan & Burak who at the time already had an idea to create game.\n\nWe are now seeking for a $60,000 grant to expand our game & express our ambitions.\n\nWe recommend you to visit for the full content: https://www.duelarenap2e.com/grant\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xed0E0cb94F60F72ec94beF848f5dF4Cbd365aF1D\n\n## Email address\n\ninfo@duelarenap2e.com\n\n## Description\n\n**What is Duel Arena P2E**\n\nDuel Arena is a open world game where you will be able to play with your own character, you can choose from 4 great nations, Fire, Water, Air & Earth. Each nation will start with 2 characters which is going to be 1 female character & 1 male character.\n\nYour character will always spawn in the hub where you have 4 core teleports each teleport leading you to a different nation, each nation has its own challenges to accomplish.\n\nYou will be able to explore the nation, dual AI bots & players. A duelling match will be strategic based, almost like a chess board. In the duelling instance you will be able to use certain NFT skills which are purchasable through the store but don't worry you will have the basics to start the game with.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jtjSLj9CrM\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Why do we need this grant?**\n\nWe started up this project with our own funds, our input was estimated around 45,000$ and are still living of this credit. This start-up helped us build a demo game, website, web market & a gameplay paper.\n\nWe haven't seen a game in DCL yet with unlimited power to expand since all of the projects are limited with lands & scenes. We are going to change this with our tech building monitors in a 2x2 Parcel where the game will be playable on for each individual.\n\nIt would be possible for us to build this game independently from Decentraland, but we intend to grow together, we want our players to be able to interact with the game through the MetaVerse. This would help us get more players and it will help Decentraland to be the MetaVerse with this enjoyable game.\n\nThe reason why we need this grant is because we need to build the game adjusted to DCL & separated from our Unity Engine. This will require a 4x4 Parcel, 3D Assets, SDK programming, Marketing, Strategy & Time.\n\n**Building the game**\nWe are building the game mainly in Unity engine, Photoshop, Blender & SDK. On our weblink you will be able to see all of our progress, Gameplay paper, update changelog & expense calculations we have made so far.\n\n***We keep updates for the game mainly on:***\nhttps://www.duelarenap2e.com/grant\n\n**How is the Grant going to be spend?**\n\nWe have a nice written documentation of our expenses written on our website, showing our initial expenses with & without DCL.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://fastly.jwwb.nl/plugin-documents/ee8bbd84249a13c543e7f098bc041b94803ae266.pdf\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nPersonnel\n\n1.

    "title": "Should we temporarily pause DCL's grants programme until Q1 2023?",
    "body": "> by 0xaca8fbbdddfce169114f344d8ee739bde665f4f4 (Seanny)\n\nTLDR: *The grants program has shown to be a key aspect and fantastic addition to Decentraland, however, the time might be right to pause and review its current structure, identifying valuable lessons from its shortcomings. A pause in the grants program would allow us to do this; coupled with a period in which governance and community roadmaps can be actively prioritized.*\n\n***\n\nHey everyone! I know this post is long, however, this is likely one of the most important governance decisions being proposed to the DAO this year, and requires quite a bit of context to lay out the reasoning behind this proposal. I encourage you to read and debate, especially if this is a proposal that you fundamentally disagree with.\n\nThe reasoning behind this proposal is fundamental to the debate, which is one of the reasons why this post is so long. You can find rest of the content in the comments section below.\n\n**Contents:**\n\n\\-> The Current Grant System\n\n\\-> The State of Our Treasury\n\n\\-> The State of Our Community \\[IN COMMENTS]\n\n\\-> General FAQs \\[IN COMMENTS]\n\n**The Current Grant System**\n\nWith its inception dating back to May 2021, the Decentraland grant system has been one of the Metaverse's most innovative, decentralized solutions to community-driven prioritization and community-led project management.\n\nSince the approval of the first Tier 6 Grant in November 2021, the Decentraland grant system has seen an exponential increase in both interest and activity; with sharp inclines in grant volume and voter activity.\n\nSo far, the grants programme has contributed a total of $2.6 Million Dollars to community-led and backed initiatives. This multi-million dollar investment has been split into the following grant priorities:\n\n*Content Grants: $269,369, 20 Grants \\[Average: $13,468]*\n*Platform Grants: $1,236,100, 14 Grants \\[Average: $88,293]*\n*Community Grants: $596,300, 19 Grants \\[Average: $31,384]*\n*Gaming Grants: $539,600, 12 Grants \\[Average: $44,967]*\n\nThe total amount of grants accepted thus far stands at 65 grants. This means that as a DAO, on average, we’ve been approving around one grant per week. 52% of these grants were grants over the size of $5,000 US dollars, with over 32% of the total grants approved being over the size of $50,000.\n\nThis exponential growth in DAO Activity has been coupled with some brilliant work conducted by our various governance squads, especially our grant support squad, who have actively been leading the application, implementation, and reporting of the DAOs grants for the last 8 months.\n\nHowever, whilst this system has generated quite a few success stories over the last twelve months, we are now facing new growing pains and paradigms that are not currently described and defined in our governance systems. The lack of clear, community-approved accounting guidelines for grants, alongside governance ‘code-of-ethics’/‘best-practice’ guidelines, has already been applying unnecessary pressure to grantees and DAO members alike. Additionally, our lack of a roadmap and collective vision as to what should be prioritized in the DAO leads to frequent and unfortunate misunderstandings/disagreements between DAO members in the process of reasoning the value of a Grant Proposal, which in the long-term, can prove to be detrimental to the DAO’s ability to generate far-reaching consensus.\n\nIn short; the current grant system is a victim of its own success, and in the run-up to 2023, it would be sound and prudent to temporarily pause the program for a short ‘grace-period’, which would allow us to assess, debate and review both the past, present and future of our grants system, with the aim of applauding our community’s successes, and learning from our collective mistakes. This data-oriented approach towards better understanding the outcomes of the $2.6M US dollars we have collectively invested thus far will be fundamental in setting the foundations and understanding necessary to begin solid footing for a potential upgraded grants system, alongside a potential community-led roadmap for the DAO.\n\n**Treasury**\n\nOne of the largest lessons we can learn from FTX’s collapse is that overexposing one’s treasuries and assets to a single type of asset as your primary source of funding and liquidity, is a major risk.\n\nCurrently, our DAO’s vesting contract is actively releasing 222M MANA over a 10-year period. This vesting contract started 2/20/2020, and so far, has vested a total of 60,871,487 MANA as of 16/11/2022. From this 60,871,487 MANA, 48,870,797.432 MANA has been released, and 12,000,689.536 MANA remains releasable.\n\nThis means that DCL DAO has a total of 161,128,513 MANA left to use until the 20th of February, 2030.\n\nAs of 14th November 2022, the DAO holds the following funds:\n\nAragon Agent:\n41,755,500 MANA | 18,437,056 USD,\n21 ETH | 26,957 USD,\n17 WETH | 21,686,\n16,738 DAI | 16,749 USD,\n2,607 USDC | 2,614 USD,\n\nDAO Committee:\n262,253 MANA | 115,797 USD,\n62,849 DAI | 62,893 USD\n8 ETH | 10,057 USD\n8,488 USDC | 8,511 USD\n1,428,019 MANA | 655,270 USD\n7 WETH | 9,104 USD\n56 DAI | 48 USD\n29 MATIC | 27.43 USD\n22 USDC | 20.60 USD\n\nThis amounts to a total of US Dollars 19,367,107, as of 14th November, 00:00 CEST Market Valuation. From this treasury of $19.3M USD Dollars; 99.1% of those assets are held in MANA, and only 0.9% of our assets are currently held in “other” tokens.\n\nCurrently, our grants programs are distributed in USD Value; meaning for each grant we approve, we usually sell the USD-Dollar Equivalent of MANA from our treasury to fund the said grants, which means the more grants we approve, the more sell pressure we are placing on MANA, as an asset.\n\nAs we increase sell pressure through the process of funding grants from our treasury, we open doors to potentially drop the price of MANA further, which further limits our available liquidity (in USD), and in turn places further pressure on both the treasury and the price of MANA as an asset.\n\nMoreover, we currently lack a prudent, clear vision on how exactly we plan to use our funds as a community; with no clear prioritization, roadmap, or goals being set by the community on what we collectively wish to achieve from our grants program. Coupled with this, there’s uncertainty surrounding how grants themselves should be accounted for, with an unclear direction being set on the financial reporting, due diligence, and overall compliance requirements for grantees (which is a fundamental best practice in most regulated industries).\n\nThe lack of a yearly budget, alongside discombobulated expectations across the community surrounding the ‘value’ the grants program should bring to the table, is not only a facet for severe catastrophic risk and potential mass-liquidation, but is also a sure-fire way of generating and accelerating community discord and societal fragmentation.\n\n- Yes, we should pause the grants programme\n- No, we should not pause the grants programme\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c8aa85b0-65e8-11ed-bf97-7dbf9f54c71d)**",

You can read the grant proposal [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b8219300-900f-11ec-9794-c9ea21a9ed8f).\n\nIn June 2022, [another grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4fad3e80-e74b-11ec-82d9-d917cdd158ac) was approved to continue working on features for the map and regularly update the project.\n\nSince getting the second grant, we’ve been updating the map with a weekly cadence (instead of monthly), we’ve worked on an optimized new mapping script with a transversal algorithm that is much more efficient than the old version and we’ve fully automated the zoom layer process by unifying the map zoom layer creation. We’ve also enabled showing extra info on top of LAND by creating a new layering system. We are now showing recently changed tiles and are currently working on showing estate delimitations. We also started saving weekly LAND content changelogs for archival purposes. Lastly, we’ve worked with a graphic designer who did the redesign of our website, getting a brand-fresh new view.\n\nPrevious map UI:\n![Previous](https://previews.dropbox.com/p/thumb/ABvkQE849OFf0zaJgZoM4frBRKwLF5SYjBlzEkGjE8G_jFNIYnY89zatBMo69irbZKFvTMsgTBCwSwI48dWy76664f7Hh5QC72MVs2l-hLJ8IsxqOHPV8\\_KR2TCvLeXEot_J0uB9a-qyFVrdDBJBkAX1nr6s8eg1Sl979dyKcJurmV3oDjnOjymhFRB500Nm62UJTvSk2kiaQAc0\\_GoKCY31bUcJqfhk-ZCY4G-qyn7PEmuwdv4JfRTL9-OTCrbr8CxYqpnxmy6MRwFctRVYOg9VL7VZBdh2IHvTyt8PH83ZOB21CVWf9cpW5\\_ZZ0R3QZ8fhYQjo6zSXwIWlgNZiz2zDVhEdhzkOgpCl6kePJdZoWVzBHr9MkrM6SgoZo79imwE/p.png)\nNew map UI:\n![New](https://previews.dropbox.com/p/thumb/ABuFEBBtiReAXwJOty7E1bsvGoUCGhI08WqkBsr0qHhpGJe2Bm5bIx8u57XXvRv31l1aM1dTuyy9esxjkjnO-SQJKD1NtO05x3rpQ3u0G_k-o9TlE7iMqAH5XvymJ0EcQcfyc4BqpSGTnoA6kqtWQKJdFl2IypT\\_3Qc-TDIs_HbaHI1fvnX3ZyY0lt4tN6zR6XBCAgKlbcwTSgqe-wFj_TQ1POXAUaH6Iu5rNuRfhnCSvlg_dxFRCu5jwBwkFkD9n1GW1CZPMdeEeruHVae078WdHOsEjXOMvtY_GmzhkltKhuPPFPrGmHZ6ZLkZk_lBULyMkh7-3h7fCTlzG1Kp_w8g6GB32R0EixmIezVTfpGgP6WPyI4buMXHisF39Wc7yrA/p.png)\n\nWe still receive a lot of feedback from the community, with requests to develop new features and things they would like to see. This grant will set up a budget, including salaries and expenses (web hosting, image storage, and domain name renewal, for now), to run this team for the next 6 months of developments and updates. Further grants will be requested by us in the future if the community continues to be happy with our work.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nA working version can be found at https://genesis.city/\n\nSite code: https://github.com/genesis-city/genesis.city\n\nWe’re using GitHub to host the images, and Netlify to handle deployments and building the website.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n*   **maraoz** - the original map prototype creator, will oversee that the project’s vision is aligned with the Decentraland community (Product Owner Role). https://github.com/maraoz\n\n*   **Rodrigo Heredia** - Full Stack Unity3d + Web Developer. https://github.com/rheredia-dev\n\n*   **seibo** - Project Manager - joined the Genesis City team in September 2022. https://twitter.com/seibo03\n\nBudget: $6,050 USD per month, resulting in a $36,300 USD grant total. This monthly budget includes the following:\n\n*   Team compensation: $6,024/month\n*   Operational expenses: $26/month\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe will continue updating a weekly version of the map and creating an NFT on Rarible with the full map once per month. The map’s content will be updated via script every week for 6 months. Once that time has elapsed we will request another grant in order to provide further maintenance and updates.\n\n**Here are the things in our roadmap:**\n\n*   Add new layers to the map:\n    *   points of interest\n    *   colors by owners\n    *   go-to-marketplace for tiles on sale\n    *   show districts\n*   Allow layers to be additive\n*   Add outline/boundaries of estates when hovering over it\n*   Add ability to have bookmarks/favorite destinations (similar to POI, but private)\n*   Add ability to share bookmarks/favorite destinations with others\n*   Implement Permalinks system\n    *   link to a specific coordinate\n    *   update URL when moving the map\n*   Have historical versions (to see the growth/change of an area over time)\n*   Allow the community to report dirty/broken coordinates\n*   Allow downloading images from the map centered at specific coordinates\n\n**We will continue developing and improving the website and mapping script based on this list and future suggestions by our community. Please let us know which features are the most important to you, so we can prioritize accordingly.**\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9d6efbe0-65d1-11ed-bf97-7dbf9f54c71d)**",

    "body": "> by 0x46c02de46629a2babe7c9ba1d9ebf0804d4f99aa (adi)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nDCLBuilderAI is a tool to generate scenes and other assets using natural language prompts (ex: create a scene with a park and a bench). Within seconds, it will generate the scene using the prompt as docstring, and a multi-layout view will display both the code for the scene and the preview. Users will be able to edit the code and preview it on the fly. For convenience, we’ll also add the option to connect your wallet and publish the scene to your land. We’ll be using Codex(an immensely powerful GPT-3 programming model) and Tensorflow for the project. We’ll later add support for using DALL-E in the scenes too.\n\nWatch this video preview of one use case that we got working by feeding in some examples from the SDK: https://youtu.be/1ldO85g10iM\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n56,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x46c02dE46629a2bAbe7c9ba1D9EBF0804d4f99AA\n\n## Email address\n\nasaxena1415@yahoo.com\n\n## Description\n\nCodex is the model behind GitHub copilot and a GPT-3 derivative which is itself trained on more than 170B parameters, making it ideal for code-generation. This is already starting to gain popularity in the industry (emerging projects: https://www.educative.io/blog/top-uses-gpt-3-deep-learning)\n\nDecentraland can benefit a lot from leveraging these OpenAI tools. Builders will be able to save thousands of hours spent on manually creating scenes, assets, avatars, etc.\n\nHere are some basic use cases we’re planning to integrate with our tool:\n\n**Generating Custom Entities, Components, Actions**\n\n*   Run primary queries like “*create a scene with a lot of trees*” and secondary queries like “*add a moving bird everytime a tree is clicked*”\n*   Actionable scenes like “*create a drunk zombie*”, “*add unicorns next to the zombie*”, “*a jumping shark*”, “*a jumping shark with a drunk zombie*”, etc.\n*   Event based assets like “*party rooms*”, “*sports avenue*”, “*cube jumper*”, etc.\n\nFor the scenes, there will be a split pane, with an editor, and a previewer - code generated through the prompt will be visible on the editor, and the user will be able to see its preview on the previewer, manipulate it, provide feedback, and even publish it to their land by connecting their wallet on DCLBuilderAI. We’ll be using SDK7 for enhanced performance/usability for our project.\n\nWe’ll create a separate pipeline to ingest all the available training data from decentraland scenes repo, SDK, and other public sources, and feed it into the codex da vinci model, fine-tuning for it to work with DCL (and generate valid output) will happen through OpenAI as well. On top of this, by giving the users the option to provide feedback on the accuracy of the results, we’ll be able to optimize feedback loops, decrease statistical errors like type-IIs, and just deliver better content. The model, training, fine-tuning, and api will be part of codex and will come from OpenAI whereas Tensorflow will be used for the data ingestion pipeline process.\n\nNote that this tool will not be assisting with minting and listing assets on the DCL marketplace but will be providing an editor and preview option for working with assets. Besides, the results are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate and will hopefully improve over time with the help of the feedback loop.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe project will require working with a number of key services such as OpenAI, Tensorflow, MetaMask, DCL SDK7, and other web development frameworks/tools. The tool will be used through a web app developed using React for frontend and Node for backend. Setting up and maintaining the infra will cost ~$12K a year.\n\nUsing OpenAI for training/usage would be expensive as well - we plan on using the da vinci language model – one of the most powerful ai models – to deliver state of the art results for our customers.\n\nOpenAI cost for running queries: $0.0200  / 1K tokens (which is roughly ~750 words)\n\nIn order to make the tool more accessible to the community, we’ll use up to $8k in funding to fund its usage so that users in the DCL community can play around with it for free. Once we’ve exhausted this funding, we will directly charge the end users to foot in the costs for their use cases.\n\nThe rest of the funds will be used as dev salary for our team - we all have skillsets in NLP prompt engineering/model training/data pipelines but would like to bring on board one data scientist/engineer too to help speed up the project development.\n\nThe project will be open-source and we’ll also try to partner with existing projects to help with components like publishing to the lands or making the previewer generate the scene as changes are made to the editor on the fly. We will later also work toward adding support for using DALL-E with GPT-3 to generate 3D models from text.\n\nBreakdown of Costs:\n\n| Work | Cost |\n| ------- | ------ |\n| OpenAI Project Community Access to DCL | $8K |\n| Web Tooling, Infra for frontend and backend, maintenance of project | $12k |\n| Total Salary | $32k |\n| Misc. Expenses | $4k |\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nAditya - Software Engineer\n\nTave - Software Engineer\n\nWe're both full-stack software engineers with prior experiences at companies like Amazon/Microsoft with exposure to large-scale AI/ML-based projects, and are also the team behind a peer-to-peer rental marketplace project called RentParcel delivered through a successful grant (https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8a1e3180-0e3a-11ed-9d53-7b405ea02bcb). We've been involved with several DCL landowners in the last 1 year, generating value for them by securing land rentals.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe plan to complete the project within six months, here are the goals we’re setting:\n\n*   Months 1-2: Work on developing the data ingestion pipeline, model training, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, creating backend for accessing OpenAI APIs for Codex.\n*   Month 3: Work on the UI for the web app that will use the tool, create scenes, other assets, previewer, and publish option to the lands.\n*   Month 4: Work on integrating the backend with the frontend.\n*   Months 5-6: Work on adding option to connect wallet, publish to land, and beta-testing the project, and granting access to the community.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9271a080-652c-11ed-bf97-7dbf9f54c71d)**",

Our NFTs double as Skins and Vehicles. Players can race, craft, and upgrade completely free. We have a 4x4 estate that houses 6 different interactive instanced scenes. That’s a total 1,536 square meters packed with unique experiences.\n\nVroomway’s mission is to provide a safe haven for vehicle lovers and racers of all kinds. We aim to provide a dynamic variety of experiences for both solo play and cooperative play. Start your laps today and earn your very own Metaverse Vehicle!\n\n**Game Trailer**:\nhttps://vimeo.com/763237194/d59035c4f6\n\n**Play Link**:\nhttps://play.decentraland.org/?position=-103%2C-144\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4b99aD2Fad8B5553dc734EDA80695591b3CA1fD5\n\n## Email address\n\nvroomwayracing@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nVroomway tells the story of a future where machines and human consciousness are one. A world created by machines for everyone to enjoy. Vroomway is the space station that bridges worlds all over the galaxy to Planeta Volo. This means the Planet of Speed in Latin. Vroomway provides the bridge to the future of what is possible. To inspire hope and encourage everyone to live in the moment and enjoy all the fun experiences life has to offer.\n\nVroomway is managed by a core team of 3 with our lead developer handling the infrastructure and back end. We have a community manager that is in charge of engaging our community on discord and in-game. Our community manager also helps onboard new players and provide community events to keep the core engaged. Our marketing person handles the social media accounts, partner relationships, and ideates/executes our marketing strategies. Our Project Manager manages and executes our business direction and project vision. They lead the game development process and 3D artwork development.\n\nVroomway has seen a gradual increase in our analytics since launching our Grand Opening on October 1st, 2022. Currently, we are seeing an average of 50 daily active users. Some days we peak at 150 while other days we valley at 43. On a monthly basis, we are seeing over 3700 sessions from our players. We expect to triple our Daily Active users over the next 3 months by fully utilizing our Social Friday experiences, consistent game releases, and upcoming partner collabs. We plan to release a brand new Fuego Circuits track every month, and brand new vehicles and attributes often.\n\n### Milestones Achieved:\n\n*   Revenue has been generated each month from in-game purchases, wearable royalties, and build commissions. We have given 5% of those revenues back to the DAO total of $152.40 USDC over 3 months.\n*   NFT floor prices rising as high as 750% on some vehicles.\n*   Players have already earned 224 mana from crafting 7 of the 12 new skins/vehicles. The highest floor is currently 60 mana.\n*   Twitter account nearing 600 followers.\n*   Fully integrated 21 NFT-based vehicles with full functionality.\n*   Two additional non-vehicle NFT-based wearables with full functionality.\n*   Established a new sponsor: The Holy Ones to our 3 existing sponsors.\n*   Created 3 Game Modes: Solo-Sprint, Demo Derby, and Fuego Circuits.\n*   Created 5 different game tracks.\n*   Integrated 9 different collectible resources and a robust crafting system.\n*   Built an interactive club with Dance and Earn utility with live events and unique musical entertainment.\n*   Held 3 different parties to celebrate the launch of each stage of the game with a DJ performance, and community giveaways - One for Alpha, Beta, and the launch.\n    *   Including performances by our own Nikki Fuego in Drag, bringing more Drag culture to Decentraland.\n*   Created 3 unique tracks for DecentRally demo during the MVMF22. This was a partnership with the Foundation.\n*   Organized 9 giveaways, of Beta wings, vehicles, and in-game rewards.\n*   We started a 16-week tournament where we pick 1 winner with the fastest Solo-Sprint time and awarded 10 MANA. In our first week, we had 58 participants!\n\n**ANALYTICS**\n\n    Database: 908\n\n    Daily Users: 50\n\n    Daily Sessions: 1,000+\n\n    Weekly Users: 350\n\n    Weekly Sessions: 7,000+\n\n    Monthly Users: 1,400\n\n    Monthly Session: 28,000\n\nVroomway Tutorial Featuring Roachkilla1746:\nhttps://vimeo.com/762813555/71d29cedd5\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo get Vroomway to the next level we will need additional resources. We have an extremely unique setup with our instancing and require some outside skillsets to elevate parts of our infrastructure. Our integration with the Infinity Engine was a huge accomplishment and enhanced Vroomway’s original vision tenfold. We learned a lot with that integration and it has sparked even more innovation on how to develop this going forward. We would like to both upgrade and enhance the current game modes, but also release some community-suggested game modes that we believe will put Vroomway above par with previous racing games in the web3 industry. This new budget also allows the majority of our team to give more full-time attention to the project.\n\n4.5 of our 6 months was building infrastructure. We have achieved nearly everything we set out to achieve and promised that we would. Our team has proven to be efficient with the tight budget and we believe we have produced a unique gaming experience within Decentraland. A few of our more dedicated racers have onboarded new players to our game as well as brand new players to Decentraland. We know that with more time we can scale these efforts!\n\nWe have generated revenue consistently over 4 months and have generated revenue this month (November) as well. The goal is, and always has been, to become fully self-sustaining so that we do not have to rely on future grants and can pay back the ones we do take. We believe we can achieve this with our 2023 goals.\n\nOur game generated over 2,500 MANA sales in wearables (primary and secondary combined). In addition, our players purchased 452 MANA worth of FUEL in-game.\n\nIt’s worth noting that since the beginning of our first grant we vowed to pay 5% of our revenue generated each month back to the DAO until the grant is paid back. We are keeping that vow with this grant as well. We have already shown good faith in this with 4 consecutive months of giving 5% back totaling $155~. Although a small amount, it shows that we can create revenue and eventually pay back the grants in full.\n\n**Goals**\n\n*   Scale DAU to 150+ within the next few months and 3x-10x within the next year\n*   Consistently generate revenue month-over-month\n*   Secure more partnerships\n*   More collabs with other games/experiences in DCL\n*   Host some of the biggest races in the Metaverse\n*   Improve in-game economy\n\n**Budget Breakdown:**\n\nMarketing: $35,000 - 12 months\n\nPersonnel: $108,000 - 12 months\n\nDevelopment: $92,000 - 12 months\n\nHere you can view our **full budget outline**: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gj-R2X15NUio7I6o9jK86OQ9ro9cItKx6rwCTIIw9oI/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nNikki Fuego - Founder, Project Manager, Lead 3D Artist:\nhttps://twitter.com/NikkiFuego92\n\nNeocyber - Lead Developer:\nhttps://twitter.com/neocyber_eth\n\nDOCTORdripp - Community Manager:\nhttps://twitter.com/DOCTORdrippNFT\n\nckbubbles - Marketing and PR:\nhttps://twitter.com/iamckbubbles\n\nDoki - Lead 3D Wearable Creator:\nhttps://twitter.com/Doki3D\n\n(Will hire) - Administrative Assistant\n\n(Will hire) - Secondary Developer/Support\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Road Map**\n\nDecember 2022 - February 2023 - $73,400\nPhase 1 - Refactor & Upgrade:\nWe plan to refactor some of our earliest infrastructure for better scene performance. We will also refactor our Demo Derby Game Mode as this has been the most difficult hurdle we have faced. We will upgrade our other game modes and the gathering profession to provide variety in difficulty and experiences. Lastly, we will be integrating a custom KPI tracking system. Because our scene is so unique with instanced scenes, we require a custom setup to understand foot traffic and player interactions.\n\nMarch 2023 - June 2023 - $78,050\nPhase  - New Game Modes and Player Ownership Value:\n\nPlayers have heavily requested two new game modes that are Drag Racing and a new version of our Grand Prix that was held in April of 2022. Drag Racing would be a linear sprint utilizing the infinity engine. It would be a point a to point b sprint with gear-shifting mechanics integrated.\n\nJuly 2023 - December 2023 - $83,750\n\nPhase 3 - Player Economy and Ownership Value:\nWe believe that the players are the most important part of our game aside from the fun factor. With this in mind, we want to always provide value both in the economy and the time spent in-game. We would like to introduce new ways to earn via mini-games that add more value to the main game modes.\n\nSee our **full road map** here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y10DdZyQi8URbv-4GyI0gcBQ6\\_8RGOanHxQkBi-iOpQ/edit?usp=sharing\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d68cbd60-6520-11ed-bf97-7dbf9f54c71d)**",

    "title": "Should a grant proposal be revoked if the grant requestor or their personnel listed, vote on their own grant proposal? (Updated version)",
    "body": "> by 0xd4f1cab694c4424c4796549edbb9b489789f4df5 (TudaMoon)\n\nIf you vote yes, this would prohibit grant requestors and initially listed personnel from voting on proposals that they have direct interest in. However, this would NOT revoke the grant if someone gets hired on the team at a later time without prior knowledge. The grant requestor or any of their accounts cannot vote on their proposal. This would not be retroactive. This would be implemented as a policy from now on if approved.\n\nWithout this CRITICAL rule, we are doomed to become centralized at some point in the future. If the DAO permits voting in a direct conflict of interest, then it will lead to Centralization. Centralization will kill the brand of Decentraland. Conflict of Interest is one of the most critical rules we must enforce to remain decentralized. Otherwise, it leads to a slippery slope of one grant passed here, one grant passed there, to owning millions of MANA to controlling the full outcome of the Decentraland DAO. It will be the Decentraland's DAO downfall, if we do NOT stop it now.\n\nI have heard current DAO members say we have a committee that would stop a centralized entity from doing acting outside the best interest of the DAO. However how does it look when Decentraland uses a centralized committee to fight against a centralized power? Right now the committee has to make a determination as a centralized entity, however if this critical rule is enacted by the DAO itself, the committee is then simply enforcing the rules that were made by the DAO. This makes the committee in the position of enforcing the rules of the DAO rather than making their own centralized rules.\n\nCurrently, revocation of Grants for conflict of interest is NOT a means for revoking a grant. Therefore, if that committee were to enact those powers of denying the grant for conflict of interest right now, when the committee hasn’t done it before, it would appear like centralized and unfair use of power. If we make the rule forbidding voting of conflict of interest, this would NOT be an issue. It would actually make the committee's job easier.\n\nAs of now, if this proposal were to be enacted, it would give the DCL Grant Squad the power to revoke grants based on conflicts of interest. However, to clarify it is not their job to do any research, it is their job to make the decision from a DAO member’s claim to them. The DAO member who makes the claim to the DCL Grant Squad must provide evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that there is conflict of interest before the DCL Grant Squad could revoke a grant. The DCL Grant Squad would have a duty to act in a timely manner.\n\nThose who care about decentralization will vote 'Yes' in this poll and will enact this critical policy to prevent centralized entities from taking over the outcomes of grant funding.\n\n- Yes, revoke grants in conflict of interest.\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c73ae920-63c4-11ed-bf97-7dbf9f54c71d)**",

This system encourages fairness and transparency of opportunities, as well as the effectiveness of funds allocation.\n\nThe DAO currently have a funds allocation process called **Grants Program**, however in such a process the project and the team are both voted at the same time.\nThe proposed Bidding and Tendering approach looks after separating the process of the DAO deciding *what needs to be done,* to the decision of *who should make it happen.* The idea is not to replace the Grants Program, but to have an impartial mechanism to carry out projects of strategic interest for the DAO.\n\nWe imagine structuring the process in the following four (4) stages, but a more detailed draft proposal should follow this poll.\n\n### 1° Community Signaling\n\nCommunity members could propose/request new projects to develop.

We propose to add several VR features, including hand tracking and hand-based menus, better avatar handling for VR, and enhancements on the VR user interface. We will continue improving the performance and reliability while also maintaining the VR client. We propose to set up a CI/CD pipeline for the VR client. The team is honored to be considered for a DAO grant for the continued development of Decentraland VR. We are excited to be part of Decentraland’s journey toward making the metaverse a fun, immersive and vibrant economy that increases accessibility to Decentraland citizens all over the world!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x6340676C1604186893Ab14521fDFc1C81AF07161\n\n## Email address\n\nsean@onginnovations.com\n\n## Description\n\n### Background\n\nIn May 2022, the community voted to approve a [Decentraland DAO grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8fe0e0a0-d62b-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0) that expanded the scope of the DAO-funded Decentraland VR client. The VR client was ported to run natively on the Meta Quest, a significant technical milestone that made Decentraland’s codebase Android compatible. The team brought the PCVR and Quest VR clients to parity with the web/desktop versions of Decentraland by bringing all screen UI and pop-ups into VR and made in-game interactions work with the VR controllers. The VR client team also made stability improvements, implemented a new VR user interface, and made heavy strides towards squashing bugs and incompatibilities related to the Android headset conversion. In this grant proposal, the VR client team seeks to continue maintaining, enhancing features, and improving the performance of the Decentraland VR clients over the next 6 months.\n\n### Summary of proposed work\n\nA summary of proposed activities is provided in this section, with additional details in the specification section of this proposal.\n\n*   **Feature enhancements:** The team proposes to add several VR enhancements, including hand tracking, more natural avatar movements for VR, and enhancements on the VR user interface. Additional details on this is provided in the specification section.\n\n*   **Improving performance and reliability:** The team is committed to improving the performance and reliability of the VR client. This includes increasing frame rate and reducing crashes and other bugs. Additional details on this is provided in the specification section.\n\n*   **Maintenance:** The team will continue to maintain the VR client over the next 6 months, fixing any breaking issues that may occur and keeping the VR client in sync with any changes from the main Decentraland branches. Additional details on this is provided in the specification section.\n\n### Final Remarks\n\nThe team proposes to build upon previous VR client efforts by submitting the current grant proposal, which is fully dedicated to the Decentraland VR client. The team is honored to be considered for a DAO grant for the continued development of Decentraland VR. We are excited and grateful to be part of Decentraland’s journey toward making the metaverse a fun, immersive and vibrant economy that increases accessibility and financial opportunities to Decentraland citizens all over the world!\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### VR Feature Enhancements\n\nThe team proposes to add several VR enhancements, including hand tracking, more natural avatar movements for VR, and enhancements on the VR user interface.\n\nUsing hand tracking (instead of controllers) is a more natural way of interacting in the metaverse. A hands-based experience will require some engineering to include items like palm-based menus, selection interactions, teleporting/movement, and other interactions that would otherwise require controller buttons/joysticks. The VR client will still maintain controller support. The hand-tracking update will not replace controller support, but will be an alternative way to interact within Decentraland VR.\n\nWe will also look at enhancing the avatar movements to leverage expanded movement in VR. For example, waving hands, limb movements (crouching), and more avatar movements that follows the user’s physical movement. We will also investigate VRM avatar support.\n\nWe will expand upon the VR UI implement during the previous grant to make it easier to access quick actions like emotes, mic settings, and teleportation to parcels.\n\n### Improving Performance and Reliability\n\nThe team is committed to improving the performance and reliability of the VR client. This includes increasing frame rate and reducing crashes and other bugs.\n\nThe largest component of this category will be to convert Decentraland existing asset bundle system (currently only set up for the web client / WebGL) and make it android-compatible for the standalone VR clients. This requires close coordination with the Decentraland foundation team and will result in a major improvement in frame rate, memory usage, and overall stability of the VR client. This is because the asset bundles are more optimized than loading in the GLTF models directly.\n\nThe team will also work closely with key Decentraland areas and community members such as the Museum District to ensure that content is VR-friendly and performant.\n\n### Maintenance\n\nThe team will continue to maintain the Decentraland client for the duration of this grant period (6 months), fixing any breaking issues that may occur and keeping the VR client in sync with any changes from the main Decentraland branches.\n\nAs part of this process, we seek to set up a CI/CD pipeline for the VR client and implement a synchronized release schedule with the primary Decentraland client.\n\nWe will seek to automate this process as much as possible to reduce future manual maintenance needs.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe items outlined in this grant proposal will be managed and completed by the Ong Innovations team and our associated partners.\n\n### The team comprises\n\nSean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n\nClint Campbell (XR developer)\n\nPaul Gumpert (XR developer)\n\nClinton Reddie (XR Developer and Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nVeeRuby (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nAppVolks LLC (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\n### Additional information on our company, team members, and partners can be found in the links below\n\nhttps://www.xrdevstudio.com/\n\nhttps://www.veeruby.com/\n\nhttps://www.appvolks.com/\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe team will report progress to the Decentraland community on an ongoing basis and will monitor the project's forum closely for questions or to provide updates as needed.

    "title": "Grant Support Squad Renewal",
    "body": "> by 0xe6af22b8fd4a2fdfec9a0b18c6be9683882d70e6 (Yararasita)\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nHi community! This proposal is to renew our Grant Support Squad. So far we have supported +100 grantees, fostering transparency and guaranteeing an efficient use of the DAO treasury. We’ve had the privilege to work closely with the grantees, and validated that the Grants Program is a key asset if we want to create a metaverse owned and created by their users, and enable the sustainable growth of Decentraland. Based on our work, the community now knows how many grants finished their projects, there is an onboarding, the updates are frequent, the grantees have a dedicated space in the TownHalls to promote their projects, and they have a clear space to ask for support to solve blockers and make requests. Here we present our following plans.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n103,200 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x658497d7681e4Fb18C65AbD5Ce066A1e3082c1e5\n\n## Email address\n\ngia.castello@decentraland.org\n\n## Description\n\nThe Grant Support Squad was created in June 2022 to support the grantees. During this period of time, this team was able to understand the grantees' needs, identified blockers and requests and provided solutions to the community. We have collaborated providing insights to the DAO Committee to [review Voting Power thresholds, the  grant's categories and budget requests to the Grants Program](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e2fbd710-426c-11ed-9eb2-21be7ab68113).\n\nWe've classified the main issues from our grantees into four categories (Tech support, Financial Support, Promotion Support, and others). We wrote the [grant's FAQs](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/grants-faq/), to the DAO documentation to provide responses to recurrent questions. On the other hand, we have started to work on advisorships with the Decentraland Foundation's team to organize frequent calls for the 5 and 6 Tier Grants (platform category), and an [AskMeAnything sessions](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-decentraland-foundation-technical-ask-me-anything-sessions/) to connect the community with the Decentraland Foundation, based on 4 tech support topics (Catalyst, SDK, Explorer, and Dapps). These facilitations will begin in November 2022.\n\nAnother frequent request from our grantees has been promotion. We hired a copywriter (Luis Mienville) to write the #Community Highlights category (with the help of the Decentraland Foundation’s MKT team) on the Decentraland official Blog . We have published 6 articles and our idea is to have more frequency, having Luis as an internal member of the team. We also encouraged the creation of the 2nd monthly Town Halls (on European timezone), to have more grantees showing their progress. Since September, we have an average of 3 grantees showing their progress in each Town Hall, who create videos and chat with the community. Since the beginning of our grant period, 20 projects were highlighted in TownHalls. We work with the Gov Facilitation Squad to spread the videos everytime we can in Social Media, Discord and DAO Newsletter.\n\nTo take care of the community treasury, we have recommended to the DAO committee to revoke grants that were delayed, not delivering their grant projects, or unable to finish due to technical blockers, until they can deliver their commitment with the DAO. We helped to recover more than $565.842 to the DAO treasury during this 5 month period since the Grants Support Squad was created. [We are aware of the negative connotation of this action](https://mirror.xyz/0x0D109CD701946D4cFE1a687b80b59Ca80732fAC5/74SS0fLMzAYS2m3noukxdsfsA3TjmOi3o6fSqolTjpQ) and that this method is not the best. But today, it is the only tool that we have to make sure the funds are going to projects that nurture our community. To decentralize this decision making, we asked who would be the best entity to revoke grants and [the community decided](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=823c92e0-2ad2-11ed-ac99-5bece7edccd0) to create a Revocation Committee to address these matters. They will be the stewards of the DAO treasury.\n\nLast but not least, we have collaborated with the DAO Facilitation Squad and the DAO Governance Squad to provide them with continuous feedback and partner with them to generate synergy among our efforts to build transparency in the community.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nFor this renewal, here are the goals, background, activities and methods we’d like to implement:\n\n**Support the grantees in Decentraland to make successful projects:**\nWe have supported +100 grantees, solving more than 80 requests and blockers and in the next 6 months we want to continue with this goal in mind, creating better and longer partnerships with the community. We are doing this by onboarding the new grantees, meeting virtually to provide support, constant communication on Discord/email, facilitating contacts, and creating strong relationships between Decentraland Foundation and our grantees to address blockers and requests.\n\n**Fostering transparency in the grants ecosystem:**\nIn the next 6 months, we want to keep on building along with the Governance App Squad a friendly platform for our grantees to post updates, communicate, receive feedback, support and review their project´s progress.\nOn this renewal, [we will work on requests for changes](https://www.figma.com/file/tL5dgm0VKP4J1JgSaHraPz/New-Grant-Request-Flow?node-id=0%3A1) to the form for requesting grants, that follow the Grants Framework, with the objective of giving the DAO more information about the grant being requested to have better context for voting. We are also requesting to implement a Final Report for the grants finished,  to understand how our grantees add value to Decentraland, and how our Grants program adds value to the community contributors. Measuring these impacts will help us understand the changes needed to make the Grants Program better in the future.\n\n**Guarantee an efficient use of the community treasury:**\nWe have been able to advise the DAO committee to execute preventive revocations for projects. This has been a difficult position, as it created friction on our relationship with some of our grantees. Nevertheless, all preventive revocations have been done with the commitment from the Grant Support Squad and the DAO Committee that if the grantees demonstrate that they deliver their projects, their vesting contracts would be resumed and paid fully. In this next period of 6 months, we will continue our efforts to design a [Framework for New Committee who decides when to revoke grants](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-275c146-framework-for-new-committee-who-decides-when-to-revoke-grants/16339), to provide transparency, decentralize the role of the Grant Support Squad and the DAO Committee, and start our role as providers of information to the New Committee.\n\nThis grant will set up a budget to run this team for the next 6 months. This grant could be extended upon a further decision of the DAO if the grant succeeds its objectives.\nThe proposed DAO Grant Support Squad will be implemented under the same non-profit foundation created for the [DAO Governance Squad](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7). This foundation provides a flexible vehicle to manage a budget with autonomy while still giving authority to the DAO to steer its direction.\n\nThe grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stablecoins assigned to a 2-out-of-3 signatures wallet. The key holders are the same as the [previous grant.](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7a236540-d305-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nSr. Grants Manager - [Gia Castello](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gia-castello-9294b238)\n\nSr. Grants accountability manager - [Pablo Lewin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewinpablo)\n\nSr. Grants Partnerships manager  - [Juan Pablo Cassinelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-cassinelli)\n\nNew member -  Ssr.

    "title": "Tower Defence Creation Kit",
    "body": "> by 0xc24789c6f165329290ddd3fbeac3b6842a294003\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThrough this grant, I am seeking funding to develop a tower defence creation kit and several deploy-ready tower defence game fields for Decentraland. The creation kit, game fields, and all assets used to generate them will be made available to the community as open-source repositories (free to use, with no strings attached).  I'll be working with several creators from the community to create sets of assets (enemies, towers, and environments) to be included in this module; providing our community with paid jobs, work experience, and providing them with an opportunity to display their talents!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n34,200 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003\n\n## Email address\n\nthecryptotrader69@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nTower defence games are a staple genre of gaming culture. The genre is so popular that fans have made variants of tower defence in nearly every RTS game that offers modding capabilities; some of these fan projects have even pivoted to become full standalone games (now that is dedication!). Decentraland has seen several different types of games break into the scene over the course of the platform’s development, but the foundations for tower defence games have never been cemented. I see this as a major missed opportunity not only for players, but also for creators and land owners within Decentraland.\n\nThe value provided by this project would benefit 3 major audiences: users, creators, and land owners. The created tower defence game fields would provide general users of Decentraland with a fun activity to partake in, while the developed creation kit could be used by creators to generate additional tower defence content. Land owners would be able to leverage the kit by hosting tower defence games on their land, likely monetizing access to premium content or wearables themed around their fields. On top of that, if we can achieve a baseline ecosystem for developing a self-propelling system of user developed content we would be able to apply that blueprint to other game genres.\n\nThis project will also provide important jobs and invaluable experience to Decentraland community creators. It is absolutely imperative that our community’s skill-level and proficiency in creating for the Decentraland platform is fostered and continues to grow. If developers cannot source resource creation from our community: they will either go elsewhere or choose to conduct their projects in a more developed metaverse. The deliverable tower and enemy assets outlined in this project will be developed and optimised specifically for the platform, giving an in-depth example of how to make assets for Decentraland.\n\nThe tower defence creation kit will provide everything a user needs to create their own tower defence field (from tower placement to enemy wave generation). The interfaces will be as simplified as possible and heavily documented to ensure users with no coding experience can still create their dream TD fields. The kit will also come pre-packed with the required assets to create a tower defence game (enemies, towers, etc), all for unlimited free use.\n\nAfter development of the kit has completed, four tower defence fields will be made using the creation kit. These game fields will be made available as open-source repositories, as well as being hosted for play by any user in Decentraland. This will allow any user looking to host a tower defence field on their land to do so with minimal effort. It also provides a great starting point for anyone looking to create their own tower defence field, as users will be free to customise/monitise these scenes or any derived scenes in any way they wish.\n\nIf we can capture the attention of even a small portion of the gaming audience by providing entertaining experiences and empowering tools then that would be a huge win for our community. By nurturing a thriving community of players and creators, we would see the constant generation of new content to attract more users to Decentraland. As we break into new genres of gaming the community (and amount of accessible content in Decentraland) would only grow. While this will likely take significant time and effort, we can begin to lay the foundations for community-based games now.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Tower Defence Kit Assets:\n\nThe kit will include a set of standard assets for creators to use in the generation of their own tower defence game fields. These will be designed to be as light-weight while still maintaining a quality appearance, ensuring in-scene resources are not misspent and acceptable performance can be maintained. Everything included in the creation kit will also be open source and made completely available to the community for use in other projects or games (including monetized scenes).\n\nThese assets will include vital components (models, animations, etc) following a single systemic doctrine that, when followed, would allow additional assets to easily be added to the module by users. Their raw pieces (such as UVs, textures, and .blend) will also be made available along-side the project in an additional compressed file. These resources will be extremely useful to anyone looking to modify existing assets or developing their own assets for the creation kit.\n\n### Tower Defence Kit Functionality:\n\nThe kit will provide all required functionality for creators to use in the generation of their own tower defence game fields. The interfaces for the kit should be easy to interact with and as hands-off as possible, enabling creators who do not have programming experience.\n\n#### Proposed Functionality:\n\n*   Tower Management: de/construction and upgrade towers that interact with enemies via classic tower defence mechanics (ie: direct damage, damage over time, movement slow).\n*   Enemy Management: enemy wave generation and spawn handling, as well as handling enemy entity specifics such as health, movement, and death.\n*   Economy Management: earn points by defeating enemies and clearing waves; spend points on building new towers and fortifying existing ones.\n*   Difficulty Management: modify the game’s ecosystem with variances to provide more/less challenge through different difficulties. (An additional feature I'd like to add, if I everything goes smoothly, is the inclusion of challenge modes where the player must complete game fields under certain constraints; something like 1-life mode).\n\nThroughout development modularity will remain a key requirement of the kit. While most users will likely be satisfied with the provided features, others might want to add their own functions/assets to the project. This process must be made as easy as possible: adding new assets to the project (such as towers and enemies) should require very little effort and only minimal knowledge of programming. Assets will be loaded at run-time through definition files targeting external assets, meaning users will only need to interact with a json file in order to add more turrets or enemies to the mix.\n\n### Tower Defence Fields:\n\nFour playable tower defence fields will also be produced with the tower defence creation kit during the project’s course. These will not only showcase the kit’s functionality, but also provide an example of how to put a tower defence game together. Like the creation kit, these playable fields will be provided through open-source GitHub repositories. Instances of these scenes will also be hosted and maintained so users can play some Decentraland Tower Defence anytime they wish!\n\nAs with previous projects, all produced content will be monitored and maintained to keep them relevant and functional within the Decentraland platform. Further features may be targeted and developed by request as the project progresses.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nHi, I’m Alex; I’ll be managing the development process, as well as tackling the module's programming implementation.\n\nI've been programming and developing projects for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). Over the past year I’ve been developing open-source projects through the DCL SDK with the primary goal of creating baseline content and examples for the community. I have already created several projects on the platform and I have a firm understanding of the development pipe-line.\n\nOne of the goals of this project is to provide an opportunity for Decentraland’s creators to showcase their talents. With that in mind, I’ve on-boarded some talented community members who will be working on generating the project’s graphical assets!\n\nArtist Core:\nCG-KING -  (Instagram)\\[https://www.instagram.com/mabanoking/]\nEmilie\nJacko\nOttonamas\nJetrolee\nFinegrapgh\n\nI feel this is the best direction to take in regards to the creation and composition of the project’s team. This orientation will not only provide the most utility-to-cost, but also enables Decentraland’s community creators and directly aligns with the results of previous community polling. After the module has been successfully developed and tested (at the close of this proposal’s term), we’ll be able to consider populating the creation kit with additional industry-grade assets.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nDuring development bi-weekly reports (every 2 weeks) on current progress and targeted goals will be published to the community.  As this project is very much for the community, feedback and suggestions on current/additional features will also be taken under serious consideration for inclusion in the project.\n\n### STAGE 0 - Viability\n\nThis phase has already been conducted.

    "title": "Support DCL Reporters and Improve Content Quality",
    "body": "> by 0xa4244f6711052752e6bb0271bf17c756e6598406 (KevinOnEarth)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nComing into our 4th revision of our proposal we have reduced our request by 75%, and retained only the costs necessary to maintain our operations while focusing on the one thing that matters most: Content Quality.\n\nWe have also established our rewards system automation, and approved a 10% royalty return from The DCL Report to DCL DAO\n\nSince January 2021 The Decentraland Report has been a platform for community members to join as reporters and preserve the history of the metaverse. By increasing the content quality and introductory ecosystem value tutorial content, we bring about a greater sense of community understanding of everyone's work across the entire Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe8C599568Fb76884C1100278A0430011067707Ec\n\n## Email address\n\nkevinonearth999@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe Decentraland Report team has been preserving the history of the metaverse since January 2021, bringing Decentraland to the attention of hundreds of thousands of people around the globe. As seen on Major News Networks such as CBS, NBC, Cointelegraph, and more, The DCL Report has grown by developing meaningful experiences around easily discovering and joining Decentraland. However, many creators/developers/designers have yet to discover ways to start exploring the Metaverse.\n\nTo prepare for a growing community, our team completed development of an automated rewards system which delivers our $REPORT tokens and NFTs via a smart contract. This initiative was accomplished with the help of community sponsors and the Decentraland DAO to solve problems in security, user retention and scalability.\n\nFor example, the increasing size of the community would be limited by the amount of prizes a person could manually send. By successfully automating this, we now are able to keep our $REPORT token distribution fair, transparent, and gives our DAO the potential to remain a platform for the community members to tell their story as they build and participate in the metaverse. Rather than request $240k at once to build this as well as optimize our quality systems, we broke this up into segmented efforts.\n\nThis is our 4th revision of this particular grant proposal as in the first 3 versions we seeked to do “Quality” and “Reach” efforts at once. After hearing community feedback, we will break this down into staged efforts, where currently quality is going to be the only focus.\n\nOur decentralized news network is a reputable and cost effective method to generate content about Decentraland. In addition, it gives community members an open platform they can participate in at various levels. Whether as a reporter, or viewers using their $REPORT tokens to reserve coverage and amplify their voice in the metaverse.\n\nOur goal is not to depend on DAO funding to sustain The Decentraland Report. We have budgeted this grant funding to elevate the overall content quality to help the ecosystem and reach a community size where we can maintain our monthly operational costs (i.e. developers, designers, video editors, community managers, social media/marketing director).\n\n\n## Specification\n\nCrafted content by DCL Subject Matter Experts explaining how to access ecosystem value will be used posting across our channels.\n\nTo address sustainability a SaaS business model has been established. Through a strategic partnership with Xpand.GG, The DCL Report retains 90% of revenue from donations and recurring subscriptions on our community page. Through our Xpand powered Community Page, we can automatically divide revenues across our team as well as our royalty payment to the DCL DAO. We will also pursue long term sponsor partnerships which can allow for more sustainable capital infusions to maintain operations.\n\nWith essential infrastructure to support our growth in place, we envision attracting like minded creators who will be positive contributing members of the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nThe style of our content will aim to attract individuals within the following demographic:\nAges 20 - 40\nIndividuals Interested/Active in Web3 & Metaverse\nUniversity/Higher Education Student & Faculty\nBackgrounds in Computer Science, Design, Music, and Art\n\nWe will focus on posting content within relevant contexts and social channels (i.e. Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, IRL events).\n\nWhile content is hosted on each Reporters individual channels, content is also now hosted across DCL Report social and content channels. The budget allocation below is a framework for spending which will allow us to optimize content, ultimately reach our goals in content quality and community size which would enable us to acquire sponsors that could offer sustainable capital for operations.\n\nWeekly Reporter Generated Micro-Content for Social Channels for 6 months ($3k/reporter, 6 Total Reporters)\n$18,000\n\nLead Video Editor (7 Individual Report Videos, and 1 highlight Video/week)\n$24,000\n\nCross Channel Content Manager\n$16,000\n\nMetaverse Quiz Giveaway Prizes\n$2,000\n\nTOTAL\n$60,000\n\nFunds managed via a Multi Signature Wallet via Gnosis-Safe.io; 3 wallet owners, 2 managed by KevinOnEarth and 1 by CEO of Xpand Alek. This is done to prevent hacking and transparent tracking of fund use and disbursement.\n\nWe are a Decentralized News Network that will always be owned by the decentralized community! By watching and joining our community they will earn rewards, learn how to navigate the metaverse effectively, and use the $REPORT tokens acquired to have their projects covered in the news when they decide to release work themselves.\n\nIn addition we will do weekly giveaways quizzing people on their metaverse knowledge. Those who have the skills and knowledge will be rewarded!\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nOperations\nFounder - KevinOnEarth999 (www.ImagineOnEarth.com)\nLead Video Editor - Nadim from Taxir\nContent Manager - Stefan (our content manager for last 1.5+ years)\n\nReporters\nKevinOnEarth NFTuesdays - Tuesdays from 11PM UTC to Wednesday 12AM UTC  & Thursdays from 11PM UTC to Friday 12AM  https://www.twitch.tv/KevinOnEarth999\n\nMetaTrekkers - Wednesdays from 1AM UTC to 2AM UTC\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/metatrekkers\n\nFriskyBumbleBee - Wednesdays from 11PM UTC to Thursday https://www.twitch.tv/friskybumblebee\n\nMoustafa - Thursdays from 4PM UTC to 5PM UTC\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/MoustafaSb\n\nFabinho - Fridays from 11PM UTC to Saturday 12AM UTC\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/fabinhodcl\n\nIna_DCL - Saturdays from 6PM UTC to 7PM UTC\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/ina_dcl\n\nReporters get rewarded as of now in a few ways:\n\n*   1 of 100 wearable Report #13\n*   1 of 1 Wearable Report #26\n*   Even revenue share of Xpand donations\n*   $REPORT tokens weekly\n*   Retain all of their own channel revenues, and sponsor fees.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nTo see our progress to date you can take a look at our Gitbook: https://kevin-on-earth.gitbook.io/the-decentraland-report-or-a-p2e-news-channel/\n\nWe conducted various surveys and analysis across our platform.

By forcing them to renew, it gives the delegator's the ability to review their delegate's history of votes and to ensure it aligns with their views.\n\nObviously it has always been up to the responsibility of the delegators to ensure their votes are being put up to good use by their delegate, however ones that don't care enough to re-delegate their VP over a chosen term are most likely the same delegators who don't care how their delegate is voting on their behalf.\n\n- Yes, expire after 6 months\n- Yes, expire after 1 year\n- Yes, expire after 2 years\n- No, keep delegation indefinitely\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=21f021b0-5e0b-11ed-9128-d95e3b6d7912)**",

If there are funds unaccounted for, fund distribution should pause until the grantee meets the conditions. This does not mean there cannot be some agile approaches to the use of the funds as unexpected circumstances happen.

Every update should include all funds used that aren't accounted for in the previous update, if applicable.\n\nIf you vote 'No,' the process will remain as is while allowing the potential misuse of DAO grant funds.\n\nInspiration: https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-3e07e00-sugar-club-operation-costs-2023/16430/17\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=31172150-5d36-11ed-9128-d95e3b6d7912)**",

Notably acclaimed  artists  Coldie3D, RobnessV2, Bootsy Collins, GraffitiKings  , Panther Modern, Connie Digital and more.\n\nWith this grant Sugar Club will be able to operate more efficiently while making sure that the quality of our events and designs remain high and engaging as well as having room for expansion.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n59,840 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xf8d8e8dCA72D41abA3E24518194E9eaF03fdDa86\n\n## Email address\n\nsugarclub@protonmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n### Here is our total budget requirements for 2023\n\n| **2023** | operation costs |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Audio / video servers | 3000 |\n| Software | 2860 |\n| Hardware | 3980 |\n| Event management | 24000 |\n| SDK game dev | 12000 |\n| Artist onboarding budget | 12000 |\n|Miscellaneous | 2000 |\n|**TOTAL 2023**| **59840 USD**\n\n### summary of the operation costs followed by more info:\n\n> Audio broadcasting (Icecast) and video streaming hosting + servers\n\n> Software subscriptions and paid digital creation tools\n\n> Hardware (DJ controller / mixer for live events, 2nd laptop during events separate from main desktop  )\n\n> Event creation and management ( designing Art posters, POAP delivery, promotion , hosting artists, live music mixing)\n\n> Wearable and emote production (mocap suit , paid software)\n\n> Upgrading and maintaining Sugar Club models and SDK code\n\n> Budget for paid gigs with DJs\n\n> Online broadcasting music licensing fee\n\n### Event creation and management:\n\nI am the sole creator and manager of events at SugarClub at the moment.\n\nThat includes creating the theme, designing the posters, updating the club to the relevant theme with animations and art, hosting the event, promoting on social, organizing the airdrops and giveaways on twitter.\n\nI plan on creating 2 branded events per month with paid dj gigs  / and NFT artists featured at our gallery ( included renown artists  from the early NFT scene )\n\nWith a bigger budget I can start looking for a community manager that could take a load off my shoulders while I focus on the main content creation.\n\n### Metaverse Electronic Music Event aka MEME\n\nI have a plan to create and organize an inclusive Metaverse Electronic Music Event (MEME) with some popular venues in Decentraland, fostering exchange and collaboration for the clubbing scene in Decentraland.\n\nPart of the Event creation budget would go towards leading the initiative and organizing the first  event in 2023..\n\n### Artist / DJs onboarding\n\nI would like to have a budget going forward that allows me to pay artists a fair price in exchange for great DJ sets. Sugar Club is welcoming existing DJs from our web3 network  ( Bufalo , Greencross, Gucci Toe,  Alien DJ , Panther Modern, Mighty33, Superflat , AmbieNFT , Mumbai Science , GraffitKings, EzzyLand , Eclectic Method , DJ Laroc, DJ LethalSkillz, Bootsy Collins etc.) .\n\nI also want to explore onboarding other  DJs and electronic producers by leveraging some of my existing contacts internationally. I have contacts in Europe, notably France, Belgium, Austria, the UK , Mexico/ South America, as well as South Korea.\n\n### Game dev\n\nLast year updates have included a new video screen projection code from the SDK repository, upgrading the main stage, optimizing textures, colliders, creating a new UI system to interact with, cleaning up all the modules of the code so they are better organized for debugging, and finally overhauling the VIP gate code to include Polygon as well as Ethereum contracts (an essential part of using NFT ticket access on Polygon)\n\nI would love to have a proper budget for game development, to maintain and debug code when necessary but also to be able to hire on demand for specific features such as a gamified experience at the club .\n\n### Retroactive costs\n\nI would like to use this grant to fund early hardware such as my mocap suit for emote creation and the 2nd laptop i use to log into DCL\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Budget specification\n\n### Servers and streaming\n\n| **Servers and streaming** | operation costs |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Audio / video servers | 3000 |\n|**TOTAL**| **3000 USD**\n\n### Software\n\n| **Software** | operation costs |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Photoshop (graphic tool)| 180 |\n| Substance Painter texturing  (3d model texturing)| 212|\n| Blender 3D add-ons (3d modeling tool) | 300 |\n| Marvelous Designer (digital garment creation) | 280 |\n| Zrbush sculpting (3d modeling tool) | 390 |\n| DJ software | 99 |\n|VJ software | 99 |\n| Audio library (paid tracks and samples) During Dj sets| 1000 |\n|Graphic AI generation tools for visuals (graphic tool) | 300 |\n|**TOTAL**| **2860 USD**\n\n### more info on software costs\n\nMaking 3d content via blender is free, however professional paid tools are essential to help with workflow and quality of delivery.\n\nOne example is wearable production. The professional workflow of designing a wearable with very detailed realistic textures is as follow:\n\nCreate High Poly model > retopology to low poly model > bake high level details onto low poly > finish texturing on low poly > dcl builder testing\n\nThis workflow requires multiple paid software such as:\n\n> Zbrush and Marvelous Designer for high resolution garments creation\n\n> Retopology add-ons for creating the low poly model\n\n> Substance Painter for texturing the garments and baking the details\n\nThese Tools are industry standards in 3d creation and are essential for digital fashion creation of high-quality garments.\n\nOther essential paid add-ons for blender include Motion capture retargeting tools for emote creation, Hard surface modeling tools, UV mapping tools etc...\n\nAll those subscriptions combined become a workflow that helps content creation tremendously and are essential to operate on a professional level as a digital artist.\n\n### Hardware\n\n| **Hardware** | operation costs |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Separate Laptop for DCL events (retroactive) | 1000 |\n|Mocap suit for emote creation (retroactive)|   2000       |\n| Pro DJ mixer / controller / audio interface | 900|\n| Headset | 80 |\n|**TOTAL**| **3980 USD yearly**\n\n> We use a main desktop station for our broadcasting,  and a smaller laptop to tune into Decentraland during events.\n\n> We also need to upgrade to a DJ controller/mixer for live DJ sets and live streaming.

    "body": "> by 0x87956abc4078a0cc3b89b419928b857b8af826ed (Nacho)\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation is working on a Rentals Protocol to let landowners put their LAND for rent in the Decentraland Marketplace. This will allow any community member who wants to build an experience in Decentraland but does not hold LAND, to rent it for a given period.\n\nSince LAND is an NFT that has Voting Power (VP) attached to it, a discussion and a decision around this need to be made. Currently, there are multiple LAND Rental protocols but with them every time a LAND or Estate is rented, a smart contract functions as the escrow of the asset. Therefore, the asset owner is the Rental smart contract, and that VP gets “lost”. In other words, that VP will be assigned to the Rental smart contract who cannot possibly vote or do anything on the DAO. To fix this, we need a Snapshot strategy that either reassigns the VP to the LAND owner or assign the VP to the renter’s wallet.\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation has already created a Snapshot strategy to keep the VP as the owner of the LANDs and Estates, but after discussing with community members the decision was to publish a community signaling poll first before activating the strategy.\n\nSummarizing, this poll tries to understand the community sentiment around the approach, should keep losing circulating VP when renting LANDs or should we maintain that VP in circulation via either the owner or the renter’s wallet?\n\nNote: A follow-up discussion needs to be made regarding other Rental protocols. Since they could also want to have a Snapshot strategy to manage VP, potentially a working group could be made to define the requirements and sort out an implementation plan.\n\n- Yes, VP remain attached to the owner’s wallet.\n- Yes, VP should be delegated to the renter's wallet while the rental is active.\n- No, VP should not be counted if the LAND/Estate is rented.\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b21c30c0-5af6-11ed-8d3a-4fd4826afe14)**",

    "body": "> by 0x858343382132b9ab46c857a7d52fdbafc039f784 (Zino)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Who should make the decision of revoking grants?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=823c92e0-2ad2-11ed-ac99-5bece7edccd0)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to create the structure and guidelines for the New Committee who decides when to revoke grants, to function effectively.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe New Committee will have the sole responsibility to order the revocation of a Grant provided by the Decentraland DAO.\n\nThis New Committee is important to decentralize the decision-making process of deciding which grants should be revoked, to take care of the DAO treasury. If this draft proposal passes, the path to revocations would be the following:\n\n1.  The Grant Support Squad recommends the New Committee to review a case when the grantee doesn't comply with the terms and conditions and the Grant Framework.\n2.  The New Committee of 5 members will study each case and would have the opportunity to request extra information regarding the case presented, and has the responsibility to provide a resolution to the community, either to revoke a grant or not to revoke a grant.\n3.  If a grant should be revoked, the DAO committee will execute the revocation\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDuring the 5 months that the Grants Support Squad has been active, we got to know the grantees on video calls, spent time with them, listened to their needs, provided support in various forms, and have seen successful grants.\n\nWalking through those [58 grants that finished  ($3.5M USD)](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7a236540-d305-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0) before the Grant Support Squad existed, we detected that 17 grants had some concerns regarding what they had first stated in their proposal and the finished projects. This represents 1,3M USD.  Almost 50% of the  funds provided.\n\nIn the current active grants, we found cases where they were not able to complete the project that the community had voted on, and some other projects that were delayed on the proposed roadmap. The difficulty in these cases is that the contracts of these grants were still vesting, without clarity if they were able to complete their grants successfully.\n\nFor that reason we recommended the DAO Committee (who has the ability to stop the vesting contracts using the contract action “revoke”), to execute the only technical mechanism that the DAO has to make sure those vesting contracts were stopped, as a preventive action. As soon as the grantee delivered according to their proposed roadmap, the DAO Committee also took the commitment to create a new vesting contract for the funds remaining.\n\nThe Grant Support Squad has started to work on the improvement of the Grants Program, particularly finding tools to mitigate the negative impact that a revocation has on the grantees.\n\nThis New Committee proposal would give an opportunity to the grantees to argue during the “revocation process”. This would mitigate the “centralized power” of the DAO Committee to judge the case, and execute the decision.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe New Committee is constituted by 5 members and 2 substitutes. The committee must be able to act immediately in case of a revocation request and each committee member will be compensated with 200 USD in MANA per case.\n\nThere will be a 6 month temporary Committee, until the Grant Support Squad opens a call for the DAO to select their representatives. This committee selected is expected to be in office for twelve (12) months and could be re-elected only for one consecutive period.\n\nThe Grant Support Squad is proposing the first temporary members to be:\n\n[Gino Cingolani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginocingolani/): Product Lead DAO governance App.\n\n[Nathalie Nuñez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathalie-nunez-38143418/): Member of the DAO Facilitation Squad.\n\n[Nacho Mazzara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/imazzara/):  Engineer Manager Decentraland Foundation.\n\n[Dax](https://gist.github.com/daxadax/f138331cdcbdda587a6fe19abe50dadf): Decentraland DAO Backend Developer.\n\n[Mattimus](https://governance.decentraland.org/profile/?address=0x65813baedfd68029af5382672b0e4dd2e6f27952): Software Engineer - DAO Committee.\n\nSubstitutes: They will be summoned when a New Committee member is involved in a [conflict of interest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fo9if4pujSTAzxnf_Vw4gYSDB7O7rP-pHZi02sieQ8o/edit#bookmark=kix.l3py2ur36q9z) or if a committee member is unavailable to join a case.\n\n[Yemel Yardi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yemel/): Software Engineer - DAO Committee.\n\n[Nikki Fuego](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikki-fuego-58a83b249/): 3D Artist and Game Maker for Decentraland DAO\n\n**Procedure**\nThe New Committee Committee starts to act when:\nThere is a formal request through a [form](https://forms.gle/UGF1wj9ueHzvWGPN8).\nThe Grant Support Squad will request the grantee to respond within four (4) days, to the concerns raised.\n\nAfter that, The Grant Support Squad will send, in the course of following four (4) days, the arguments for the New Committee to evaluate the case. This triggers a preventive revocation, later to be executed by the DAO committee.\n\nAfter that, the New Committee will have six (6) days to discuss the case among the 5 members.\n\nDuring the period of six (6) days, the New Committee has the ability to request further information to the Grant Support Squad or the Grantee about the case presented, not exceeding 30 days.\nAfter that, the Grant Revocation Committee has five (5) days to publish the final resolution.\n\n**Conflicts of interest**\n\nAny member of the New Committee should be prevented from participating in a case when:\n\nThey have participated in the Grant as advisors, paid members of the team, or if they are beneficiaries of the Grant.\n\nThe grantee under review is recognized to be a relative, close friend or public enemy from the committee member.\n\nThe committee member has a commercial relationship with the grantee.\nBefore starting the revocation process, the committee member is involved in the process to be removed from the New Committee.\n\nThey have received “gifts” from the grantee within the period of the grant, including the grant’s proposal voting period.\n\n**Execution**\n\nThe New Committee will reach the final decision by simple majority.\n\nThe resolution should be clear and public. This contains the committee’s arguments on why the grant should/should not be revoked.\n\nThe Final decision will be notified in the Grant’s proposal page as a comment, in the grant’s dedicated discord channel and the DAO Newsletter.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith this draft proposal we aim to gather feedback and inputs from the community regarding this proposed framework with the objective of creating a final governance proposal that includes the vision and needs of our grantees and the community.\n\nPlease feel free to add any comments and suggestions into this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fo9if4pujSTAzxnf_Vw4gYSDB7O7rP-pHZi02sieQ8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fca083a0-595a-11ed-be45-c5d5549af004)**",

We have established our rewards system automation, and approved a 10% royalty return from The DCL Report to DCL DAO. Now, by increasing the content quality and introductory ecosystem value tutorial content, we bring about a greater sense of community understanding of everyone's work across the entire Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nOur surveys show high user satisfaction, retention, and an active creative economy. We offer valuable opportunities which allow members to receive both crypto and fiat rewards and hope to extend our support to reach a point of self sustainability.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe8C599568Fb76884C1100278A0430011067707Ec\n\n## Email address\n\nkevinonearth999@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe Decentraland Report team has been preserving the history of the metaverse since January 2021, bringing Decentraland to the attention of hundreds of thousands of people around the globe. As seen on Major News Networks such as CBS, NBC, Cointelegraph, and more, The DCL Report has grown by developing meaningful experiences around easily discovering and joining Decentraland. However, many creators/developers/designers have yet to discover ways to start exploring the Metaverse.\n\nTo prepare for a growing community, our team completed development of an automated rewards system which delivers our $REPORT tokens and NFTs via a smart contract. This initiative was accomplished with the help of community sponsors and the Decentraland DAO to solve problems in security, user retention and scalability.\n\nFor example, the increasing size of the community would be limited by the amount of prizes a person could manually send. By successfully automating this, we now are able to keep our $REPORT token distribution fair, transparent, and gives our DAO the potential to remain a platform for the community members to tell their story as they build and participate in the metaverse. Rather than request $240k at once to build this as well as optimize our quality systems, we broke this up into segmented efforts.\n\nThis is our 3rd revision of this particular grant proposal as in the first 2 versions we seeked to do “Quality” and “Reach” efforts at once. After hearing community feedback, we will break this down into 2 efforts, where currently quality is going to be the only focus. We will be led by none other than Pink Bambii (Imen Maaroufi, of Pink & Shades) who’s focus will be managing our team, meetings, personnel changes, documents for transparency, content planning, etc. Previously this was taken on by KevinOnEarth, but to offer diverse leadership and new ideas PinkBambii honorably takes on this role after nomination from the DCL Reporters.\n\nOur decentralized news network is a reputable and cost effective method to generate content about Decentraland. In addition, it gives community members an open platform they can participate in at various levels. Whether as a reporter, or viewers using their $REPORT tokens to reserve coverage and amplify their voice in the metaverse.\n\nOur goal is not to depend on DAO funding to sustain The Decentraland Report. We have budgeted this grant funding to elevate the overall content quality to help the ecosystem and reach a community size where we can maintain our monthly operational costs (i.e. developers, designers, video editors, community managers, social media/marketing director).\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo address sustainability a SaaS business model has been established. Through a strategic partnership with Xpand.GG, The DCL Report retains 90% of revenue from donations and recurring subscriptions on our community page. Through our Xpand powered Community Page, we can automatically divide revenues across our team as well as our royalty payment to the DCL DAO. We will also pursue long term sponsor partnerships which can allow for more sustainable capital infusions to maintain operations.\n\nWith essential infrastructure to support our growth in place, we envision attracting like minded creators who will be positive contributing members of the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nThe style of our content will aim to attract individuals within the following demographic:\nAges 20 - 40\nIndividuals Interested/Active in Web3 & Metaverse\nUniversity/Higher Education Student & Faculty\nBackgrounds in Computer Science, Design, Music, and Art\n\nWe will focus on posting content within relevant contexts and social channels (i.e. Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, IRL events).\n\nWhile content is hosted on each Reporters individual channels, content is also now hosted across DCL Report social and content channels. The budget allocation below is a framework for spending which will allow us to optimize content, ultimately reach our goals in content quality and community size which would enable us to acquire sponsors that could offer sustainable capital for operations.\n\nWeekly Reporter Generated Micro-Content for Social Channels for 6 months ($4k/reporter, 6 Total Reporters): $24,000\n\nLead Video Editor (7 Individual Report Videos, and 1 highlight Video/week): $24,000\n\nProgram Manager: $24,000\n\nReporter Equipment (Camera, Lighting, Microphone; $2,000/reporter): $12,000\n\nCross Channel Content Manager: $16,000\n\nIRL Event Presence and Attendance Budget (4 events attended): $10,000\n\nChief Newsletter Editor: $6,000\n\n6 Months of “MetaMoments Wearables” Giveaways: $4,000\n\nTOTAL: $120,000\n\nFunds managed via a Multi Signature Wallet via Gnosis-Safe.io; 3 wallet owners, 2 managed by KevinOnEarth and 1 by CEO of Xpand Alek. This is done to prevent hacking and transparent tracking of fund use and disbursement.\n\nWe are a Decentralized News Network that will always be owned by the decentralized community! By watching and joining our community they will earn rewards, learn how to navigate the metaverse effectively, and use the $REPORT tokens acquired to have their projects covered in the news when they decide to release work themselves.\n\nIn addition we will also reinitiate our MetaMoment Wearables monthly drops. The cost breakdown for this is $300-$500 to the wearable creator depending on quality or complexity, like, top. Then ~$200 for the publishing, and then the Reporter who captures the picture that is voted the MetaMoment of the month, that we create the wearable after, is given $250 as a prize. Another incentive for Reporters to capture good stuff during their stream to get that prize.\n\nWe will also execute a strategy around event attendance and an IRL presence through speaking engagements, which will bolster networking opportunities to connect with individuals inside the web3 space, but also individuals outside of Decentraland seeking to discover web3 possibilities in the “real-world”.\n\nThe events which we are targeting include: DCentralMiami, ETH San Francisco, Consensus, International Conference on Internet of Things Based on Blockchain (ICIOTBB), Blockchain Africa Conference.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nOperations\nFounder - KevinOnEarth999 (www.ImagineOnEarth.com)\nProgram Manager - PinkBambii (https://pinkandshades.com/)\nGraphic Designer/3D modeler - Sango of the East\nCGI and Animations - Cinetica.Studios\nLead Video Editor - Nadim\nContent Manager - Stefan\nChief Newsletter Editor - Lena\n\nReporters\nKevinOnEarth NFTuesdays - Tuesdays from 11PM UTC to Wednesday 12AM UTC  & Thursdays from 11PM UTC to Friday 12AM  https://www.twitch.tv/KevinOnEarth999\n\nMetaTrekkers - Wednesdays from 1AM UTC to 2AM UTC\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/metatrekkers\n\nFriskyBumbleBee - Wednesdays from 11PM UTC to Thursday https://www.twitch.tv/friskybumblebee\n\nMoustafa - Thursdays from 4PM UTC to 5PM UTC\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/MoustafaSb\n\nFabinho - Fridays from 11PM UTC to Saturday 12AM UTC\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/fabinhodcl\n\nIna_DCL - Saturdays from 6PM UTC to 7PM UTC\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/ina_dcl\n\nReporters get rewarded as of now in a few ways:\n\n*   1 of 100 wearable Report #13\n*   1 of 1 Wearable Report #26\n*   Even revenue share of Xpand donations\n*   $REPORT tokens weekly\n*   Retain all of their own channel revenues, and sponsor fees.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nTo see our progress to date you can take a look at our Gitbook: https://kevin-on-earth.gitbook.io/the-decentraland-report-or-a-p2e-news-channel/\n\nWe conducted various surveys and analysis across our platform.

    "title": "DCL Developer Symposium (Uganda)",
    "body": "> by 0xed8729fc40eac14655c841bfc4080e5a451d10d0\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nJoab Niwagaba is a blockchain enthusiast who has earned an experience of 3 years on the blockchain space. He is a blockchain educator,  represented different Blockchain ecosystems in East Africa particularly Uganda and Rwanda.\nI’m proposing to organize an in-person Developer Student Symposium that will draw students from all over Uganda. This event will expose our community to a new and more interesting experience in the metaverse, minting and market place of NFTs on the metaverse, the DeFi and transaction process on the DCL.\nThe key objective of this engagement is to generate buzz around the DCL ecosystem and get students familiar with the ecosystem so that they feel confident and excited about pursuing more advanced projects.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n8,500 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xeD8729fC40eAC14655C841Bfc4080E5a451d10d0\n\n## Email address\n\nniwagabajoab1000@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nAfrica and Blockchain are compatible, if there is a radical change that should happen to Africa then it has to be with Blockchain a borderless, secure, transparent, fast, system that would help everyone. Aspects ranging from economy, health, data, politics among others are top notch aspects that need to be addressed by many African countries if not all, the question has always been how? With what?. Blockchain offers the answer to these questions which is so evident with a few problems that have been addressed with a few years of integration of blockchain in Africa, the best example is DeFi, the money sector has greatly been influenced with blockchain offering, fast, secure, low fees transactions across Africa and the entire Globe, thus greatly impacting the economy despite the fact that some states are reluctant to incorporate blockchain for fear of losing control, which is why Blockchain is the best option to address many of problems faced with Africa.\nThe underlying factor is, how can the Blockchain help address these problems, it is known to everyone that the blockchain tech is so diverse and so specific places with specific problems at hand would chose a specific blockchain use case that would address the problem which calls for identifying the problem that needs to be solved.\n\nHowever, knowing the problems the world is facing and having the urge to solve them isn’t enough. To solve these problems takes more than just blockchain, it takes using the best blockchain ecosystem that provides a set of services that can be leveraged on by a diverse community, not limited to anything  Decentralland does not only offer storage clouds but also exposes one to the metaverse world, marketplace of digital assets, number of user applications, the best software framework, low fees and fast transactions, transparency and inclusivity leaving out no one. Uganda in this case, the young generation I have interacted with before has so much enthusiasm and passion to exploit the opportunity that has come with blockchain, many of them are involved in NFT projects, gaming, developing and coding, content creation among others however having a place where they can actualize, profit and get value from their creation is the question,  which is why with pride I would love to bring DCL to my community weighing that it is the best ecosystem I would love the community to interact with. So, this grant aims at aiding the process of introduction of DCL to the Student Community in Uganda. More to the introduction is to help these newly introduced students on how to use the different use cases on the DCL ecosystem.\n\nStudent communities have been largely untapped by web3 communities, but they hold the key to spreading the word about DCL amongst their friends and longer term becoming potential recruits as DCL developers and advocates, consumers of the already made services. Establishing a strong community in this demographic will give DCL a clear first-mover advantage that will pay forward huge rewards in a short period of time. More to this is to onboard about 300 students in the DCL community, with a skill set of how to use different use cases on DCL.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis is to a be a series of events leading to one big event,  reason being that every other student should be given chance to be indoctrinated to the DCL ecosystem, so, I aim at having a series of 5 five events, I intend hosting the first 4 events in different off city Universities, by this I mean I will have an event at Mbarara University of Science and Technology, with approximately 100 students, Kabale University with approximately 50-100 students, Gulu University with approximately 100 students, Uganda Christian University with approximately 80 students, and finally host the big event that I intend to have all students from the city, with Makerere University, Kyambogo University, Kampala International University, East African International University, Bugema University, and some other different stakeholders in the city like the Motiv Innovation Hub with an approximate number of 200-250 students. I aim at having different speakers at this particular event both in person and virtually who have a more understanding and experience so that they contribute in education of the students, speakers from different Blockchain Backgrounds\n\nI intend to use the funds being requested as listed below\n1250 usd will be used for each of the first 4 events in different off city universities and these funds will be allocated  to hiring the venue, acquiring equipment to use on the venue( projector and sound system) swag printing for purposes of more advertisement, and refreshments. (venue-500 usd, equipment-250 usd, swag printing- 300 usd, refreshments- 200)\n3500 usd will be used for the very last event that will comprise the city universities. And the funds will be allocated to venue hiring, high bandwidth internet, equipment, swag printing, refreshments (Venue-1000 usd, internet-800,  equipment- 600(projector, PA), swag printing- 600, refreshments-500)\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nYanick Musafiri\nYanick is a full stack developer with experience in solidity, a co-founder of the octan.group (https://octan.group/ ), he is the lead developer at decade ( https://dacade.org/ ), Yanick has worked on different projects both web3 and web2 check his github (https://github.com/musayann). With partnership with the apeunit Yanick helps in the educating about different software classes (https://apeunit.com/people)\nyannick@octan.group\nhttps://twitter.com/musayann\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/musayann/\nAhimbisibwe Brian\nBrian is a blockchain educator who has an experience of about 4 years. check his twitter https://twitter.com/ahimbis07260494?t=3NkaIsd9HjfrUMa4wU9O5Q\\&s=09\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nUpon the launching of the project I estimate to will have completed the first 4 off city events in the first month.  Every event successfully completed will be submitted with a report to the DCL team to show progress. the last event will be arranged two weeks later and upon completion it also will be submitted with a report to DCL team\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=873863e0-55fd-11ed-be45-c5d5549af004)**",

Dollhouse has a reputation for community building and successful onboarding, throwing several community events a week as well as special events throughout the year.   Many newcomers' first experiences were at Dollhouse - we have been described as a “home away from home”.\n\nI am asking for a Tier 5 Grant to cover expenses for Dollhouse, as well as to provide funds for more ambitious events and unique experiences for the community throughout the year.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n115,600 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x3C6730227F5785bA37e8d4464DBF9A1D87e4f0AC\n\n## Email address\n\ntangpokoDCL@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nDollhouse is known as a place of friendship and unity, where everyone – friends and newcomers can feel safe, seen and heard.\n\nMy vision is to continue to operate Dollhouse at its current high level and additionally curate and create unique experiences throughout the year  that are press-worthy, capturing mainstream attention and giving newcomers a reason to onboard.\n\nBackground: Dollhouse has held over 100 events to date. At least three events are held consistently every week, including two music-based events and regular hosting of Beyond The NFT. The weekly Wagmi Wednesday party is enjoyed by all and stirs up the marketplace each week as people purchase wearables to fit each weekly theme. One of our recent regular events is a weekly live art/music show. Memorable community special events include DCL Prom Night, May The Fourth Party, the Babydoll Awards, and the first One Metaverse party streamed both in Spatial and in DCL.\n\nOne of my main missions is to onboard more DJs and musicians into the Web3 space, with an emphasis on female and underrepresented groups in the space. To date we have hosted over 30 DJs/musicians at Dollhouse.  All events have been free and open to the community.\n\nThis year, Dollhouse has hosted:\n\n*   Multicultural events like the the two-day Latin Festival\n*   NFT project events such as Killabears\n*   Virtual/IRL hybrid events like NFT BC and Holotopia Fashion Show\n*   Multiple wearable launches for the community\n*   Inclusive events such as the Pride Party with Baby Yors\n*   The first official multi-metaverse event with Spatial\n*   Branded events with Decentral Games, EveryRealm and Mixcloud\n\nDJs and musicians we have featured include :\n\n*   Alison Toy\n*   Baby Yors\n*   Y3LDA\n*   Elyse Rich\n*   Evie The Cool\n*   Sky Jetta\n*   Mo Mami\n*   Allis\n*   Chris Stylez\n*   DJ Webber Don\n*   UnkFunk\n*   June Jissle\n*   GranolaBoy\n*   Zoo Bros\n*   Roxie J Summers\n*   DJ Hu Dat\n*   Soultry Dubs\n*   AkaHorus\n*   GucciToe\n*   Stoney Eye\n*   Jack Frost\n*   Bufalo\n*   Pansd\n*   Abilitea\n*   CJ Trax\n*   K3YFLO\n*   DJ Jacks\n*   Beni Swift\n*   New Girl\n*   0xBlnky\n*   Mr Swe\n*   Edolena\n*   The Perris\n*   VJ Deliria\n\nWith the funds from this grant, Dollhouse will continue to:\n\n*   be a home base for the DCL Babydolls\n*   foster a culture of belonging and be a safe space for women and newcomers\n*   provide high quality weekly events for the community\n*   be a launchpad for DJs and musicians entering Web3/metaverse space\n\nDollhouse will also be able to:\n\n*   retroactively cover some costs from our first year of operation\n*   continue to consistently operate at the same high level we have shown to date\n*   plan more ambitious Special Events crafting unique experiences and bringing in higher profile talent to attract mainstream attention and encouraging newcomers\n*   increase marketing efforts both in and outside the DCL community\n*   hire an assistant to help coordinate events\n*   hire a community manager for our discord/socials\n\n\n## Specification\n\n![table](https://i.imgur.com/h2EctUi.jpg)\n\n[link to table](https://i.imgur.com/h2EctUi.jpg)\n\n### Budget Details\n\n*Server:* This livestream service is consistently stable with no downtime or skipping.

    "title": "New Proposal Type: Land Concession",
    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should the community begin discussing a revitalisation strategy for Plazas?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9987c5a0-2bf4-11ed-ac99-5bece7edccd0)\n\n## Summary\n\nFormalize a process to request to the DAO the operator’s rights of a public space, such as a plaza, a road and other DAO’s owned LAND.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal calls for the creation of a new proposal type in the Governance dApp, called Land Concession, that allows anyone to request the permissions to deploy content on the requested LAND/ESTATE.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe recently approved grant of LastSlice collective:  [An Immersive In-World Marketplace Proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0f9a4300-23c9-11ed-b4a9-178eb7bc02f5) has shown the need for a formal process for the DAO to make a concession of a public space.\n\nAt the moment the public spaces such as roads and plazas are being operated by the Decentraland Foundation. This has been a good solution so far but now the DAO needs to have a formal process to delegate the development of public spaces to other members of the community.\n\nSee this two relevant proposals:\n\n*   [Should We Utilize Genesis Resources](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=712b6450-1b31-11ed-96c7-2fa07c6df25b)\n*   [Should the community begin discussing a revitalisation strategy for Plazas?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9987c5a0-2bf4-11ed-ac99-5bece7edccd0)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Land Concession proposal enables Decentraland citizens to request the operators right of LAND and also to revoke a currently active concession. The proposal should define the LAND Coordinates, duration of the lease, purpose of the lease, company signing the lease agreement and the wallet to give rights to.\n\nThe Land Concession should automatically expire after 6 months and the beneficiary should re-submit their proposal in order to get the concession for another term.\nThe land that is not under an active concession should be given to the Decentraland Foundation to manage and deploy content as they have been doing so far.\n\nIf the DCL Foundation wants to secure their rights of using a public space (e.g. Genesis Plaza) they should request it by submitting a Land Concession proposal as any other community member.\n\nThe Governance Proposal should allow to concession Plazas, roads and other LANDs that the DAO might own in the future. The Governance Proposal should not let you request a concession for a piece of land that is already granted to a community member.\n\nThe Governance Proposal form should include questions regarding the purpose and intended use of the requested space. The spirit of this proposal is to encourage the development of public services that benefit the DAO and the whole community.\n\nVoting specifications:\n\n*   Submission Threshold: 100 VP (i.e. equivalent to one name)\n*   Approval Threshold: 6M VP\n*   Voting Period: 2 Weeks\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy doing this we keep empowering the Decentraland community to make decisions about the project via proper DAO Governance mechanisms while simplifying the operations and making the process transparent.\n\nThe public spaces of Decentraland should be developed by its community and this is the right mechanism to assign those responsibilities in an open way.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=cb5488d0-5399-11ed-be45-c5d5549af004)**",

    "title": "Parkour Creation Kit Expansion",
    "body": "> by 0xc24789c6f165329290ddd3fbeac3b6842a294003\n\nShould the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nI am seeking funding for further development of the parkour creation kit. This module currently provides all functions required for users to create their own parkour stages in Decentraland. Parkour stages can be made up of several different platform types (static, moving, rotating, and blinking) and can be separated across several different sets (allowing for different difficulties of the same stage).\n\nThe proposed expansion would add in-scene collectibles, death mechanics, and a checkpoint respawn system to the current list of features. Creators would be able to use these systems to gamify their stages by providing completion challenges and respawn locations for when the player reaches a failure point (e.g. falling in lava).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003\n\n## Email address\n\nthecryptotrader69@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nParkour is prevalent throughout the internet and gaming culture. It spans many genres of games and has become a staple activity in even some of the most popular games (Minecraft and Roblox to name a couple). Decentraland has the potential to become a new hub for parkour creators and enthusiasts; developing this module further would enhance the experience that can be created through this kit.\n\nYou can view the module here: [Repo](https://github.com/TheCryptoTrader69/Decentraland_ParkourKit) and [Live Scene](https://decentraland-parkour-kit.herokuapp.com/)\n\nThe current set of features allows users to fully create their own parkour stages. The module’s implementation also massively reduces the level of programming knowledge required to create their own stages. However, the module currently lacks game elements associated with the parkour/platformer genre, such as collectible objects and death/respawn mechanics. These elements can be successfully reproduced in tandem with the module, but are not baked into the kit and many users will likely lack the required skills needed to craft these features on their own.\n\nThis proposal is meant to remedy those gaps by providing access to those systems in a similar manner to the platform creation interface. Users would be able to define and place collectibles (coins, relics) around their parkour courses, create traps/zones to kill players, and checkpoints for the player to respawn at when they are killed; all through the modification of simple files.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis module currently allows users to set up dynamic parkour courses made up of varying platform types. The relatively complex systems that make up these core utilities have been hidden from the user by providing them with simple interfaces to define and generate their platforms for the parkour stage. By providing the power of the SDK through interfaces, users can take advantage of its power without requiring advanced programming knowledge. Advanced users can also easily modify the module to fit their own needs by adding new platform visual styles or movement types.\n\nThe planned features for this expansion are:\n\nCollectibles System: users will be able to define and place collectibles around their parkour stages. Collectibles can be defined in different tiers/types, allowing users to place higher tier collectibles in hard to reach locations. These will be placed in the game space and collected when a player touches them. The system will also provide a count of gathered and remaining collectibles on the player’s HUD, providing the player with feedback on how much of the course remains and when it has been successfully completed.\n\nDeath Mechanics and Respawn System: Users will be able to create deadly traps/death zones around their stages to defeat players and provide respawn locations for the player. Checkpoints can also be used to modify player respawn locations (allowing players to save their progress as they adventure through the parkour stage).\n\nA scene will also be produced using the module to showcase these features and providing an example of how to create a parkour stage with the kit. The current theme of the scene is Jungle Temple, featuring 2 tiers of in-game collectibles and several trap types (e.g. spikes, blow darts). This scene will be hosted along-side the current example scene, through its own repository (the more content/examples the better).\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI'll be working on this project individually. I've been programming for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). Over the past year I’ve been developing open-source projects through the DCL SDK with the primary goal of creating baseline content and examples for the community so we can pro. I have a firm understanding of the development pipe-line and I have already completed several projects on the platform.\n\nYou can also play some of my previously developed projects here:\n\n[Minesweeper](https://decentraland-minesweeper.herokuapp.com/)\n\n[Solitaire](https://decentraland-solitaire.herokuapp.com/)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis project will be completed within 2 weeks of this proposal's acceptance. The basic roadmap is as follows:\n\n    -Week 1: Implementation of core features, rough demo scene made available for feedback.\n    -Week 2: Scene/code polish, implementation of any additional suggested features within scope.\n\nAs with any project, there will likely be bugs/flaws in implementation; I'll be maintaining the main repository and will work towards fixing these as they get flagged. There will also the possibility of additional work on expanding this module, by adding requested features that improve the module's utility.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b683d870-5326-11ed-be45-c5d5549af004)**",

    "body": "> by 0xd750c200b1009cf4232532ac8d676a7cb790c974 (Tim)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nSupport a book called “The underlying logic of the metaverse” to use DCL as the specific user case, which DCL will cover at least 80% of the content and 80% of the pictures according to any metaverse use cases. The goal of this project is to introduce DCL to Chinese public messes, lift their interests in DCL metaverse and take the largest market in the world to DCL virtual space.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n19,500 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xD750C200b1009cf4232532ac8D676a7cB790C974\n\n## Email address\n\ncontact@dachainrk.io\n\n## Description\n\nThis is the revision of a previous proposal applied ended on Oct, 20. The old application is posted [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=847247f0-4547-11ed-9eb2-21be7ab68113) (please take a look of this post).\n\n**We had quite a few discussions and many DCL members had expressed that it's a good proposal, and they would like to lower the cost. Some member showed their concern about  the publishing cost, or even did their own research, which is very good and I appreciate. However, the real situation is quite different from many may know. This project is including the success of publishing as well as the promoting and marketing. It's not just like an individual expending $200-$2500 to make a book available somewhere. As we all know, every book goes through a mandatory censorship process overseen by the Chinese state. We guarantee the acceptation and its sales on the huge market.**\n\nSince this application is just lowering the support amount. I re-post the rest below.\n\nThis project is to support a Chinese book called “The underlying logic of the metaverse”.\n\nThe book will be published in Chinese for the first edition. It will be targeting to Chinese public masses. The aim of this book is to introduce one of the best true metaverse in the world and provide a comprehensive perspective to public people to truly experience and better understand the metaverse. The book will be published by China Machine Press (CMP), one of the top publishing houses in China.\n\nThe book will use a specific metaverse project/platform as a user case. As this project is proposing here, the user case will be DCL. The book will not only bring people to experience the city, streets, lands, buildings, avatar, wearables, arts, events, moving, seeing, acting etc. in the new world, but also teach people to understand the underlying logic of FT, NFT, DAO, smart contract, governmental token, DeFi, P2E etc.\n\nThis project will benefit DCL in many aspects, at least including:\n\n*   Reach 1.4 billion people who are mostly clueless but eager to know about metaverse;\n*   Lift DCL industry fame world-widely;\n*   Open a permanent and high-quality channel to absorb new user steams;\n*   Lay the foundation of people’s understanding in DCL as the most classic metaverse in the world;\n*   Much more potential opportunities in the future.\n\nTo fulfill this task, we need your supports on the grant to cover part of related expenses including Team compensation, operational cost, expert consultation fee, publishing cost, etc.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWhat we have done:\n\n*   \\[x] We have entered a contract with China Machine Press (CMP) to publish “The underlying logic of the metaverse” within 6 months. CMP is a very classic, famous, and popular press established in 1952 in China. It’s one of the largest comprehensive science & technology publishing houses in China. After publishing, CMP will promote the book by their own broad channels such as Tiktok, Dangdang, jd.com… as well as various offline resources. BTW, Dangdang is the largest online bookstore in China, much more famous than Amazon, locally speaking.\n*   \\[x] This book will be co-published with Shenzhen Software Industry Association which has 4,000 IT company members. The SSIA will also promote the book using their association networks.\n*   \\[x] We have outlined the first level of the catalog. It contains seven chapters. This framework has been reviewed and accepted by CMP and kind of fixed.\n*   \\[x] We have got the promise from CMP to receive the CIP and ISBN before the end of 2022, as long as everything goes within expectation.\n\nIf this grant is approved. We promise:\n\n*   \\[ ] DCL will be the main example for metaverse in the book;\n*   \\[ ]  DCL will be the only user case in the book to guide the readers;\n*   \\[ ]  DCL will cover at least 80% of the content of the book user case;\n*   \\[ ] DCL will cover at least 80% of the images/pictures of the book user case;\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**About us**\\\nWe are a national certified high-technology cooperation based in Shenzhen, mainland China.

We got financed by InJesterr, Kaan & Burak who at the time already had an idea to create game.\n\nWe are now seeking for a $60,000 grant to expand our game & express our ambitions.\n\nWe recommend you to visit for the full content:\nhttps://www.duelarenap2e.com/grant\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xed0E0cb94F60F72ec94beF848f5dF4Cbd365aF1D\n\n## Email address\n\ninfo@duelarenap2e.com\n\n## Description\n\n**What is Duel Arena P2E**\n\nDuel Arena is a open world game where you will be able to play with your own character, you can choose from 4 great nations, Pyro, Hydro, Anemo & Dendro. Each nation will start with 2 characters which is going to be 1 female character & 1 male character.\n\nYour character will always spawn in the hub where you have 4 core teleports each teleport leading you to a different nation, each nation has its own challenges to accomplish.\n\nYou will be able to explore the nation, dual AI bots & players.\nA duelling match will be strategic based, almost like a chess board.\nIn the duelling instance you will be able to use certain NFT skills which are purchasable through the store but don't worry you will have the basics to start the game with.\n\n**Why do we need this grant?**\n\nWe started up this project with our own funds, our input was estimated around 45,000$ and are still living of this credit. This start-up helped us build a demo game, website, web market & a gameplay paper.\n\nWe haven't seen a game in DCL yet with unlimited power to expand since all of the projects are limited with lands & scenes.\nWe are going to change this with our tech building monitors in a 2x2 Parcel where the game will be playable on for each individual.\n\nIt would be possible for us to build this game independently from Decentraland, but we intend to grow together, we want our players to be able to interact with the game through the MetaVerse. This would help us get more players and it will help Decentraland to be the MetaVerse with this enjoyable game.\n\nThe reason why we need this grant is because we need to build the game adjusted to DCL & separated from our Unity Engine. This will require a 4x4 Parcel, 3D Assets, SDK programming, Marketing, Strategy & Time.\n\n**How is the Grant going to be spend?**\n\nWe have a nice written documentation of our expenses written on our website, showing our initial expenses with & without DCL.\n\nhttps://www.duelarenap2e.com/grant\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe are building the game mainly in Unity engine, Photoshop, Blender & SDK.\nOn our weblink you will be able to see all of our progress & expense calculations we have made so far.\n\nWe will also showcase a piece of our Demo game.\nhttps://www.duelarenap2e.com/grant\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**Personnel**\n\n1.

    "title": "Tower Defence Module: Budget and Approach Polling",
    "body": "> by 0xc24789c6f165329290ddd3fbeac3b6842a294003\n\nThe purpose of this poll is to gather information and feedback on the community sentiment towards larger/more polished community module projects. In this case, I’m looking for feedback on the idea of creating a tower defence module for the community.\n\nThe current plan is to create a tower defence creation kit that would handle all the complicated tasks of running the game (enemy spawning/movement, tower placement/upgrade, economy, etc), as well as provide visual assets for use. This would allow users to create their own game fields with ease and provide a foundational starting-point for a new genre of community generated content in Decentraland. The module would be entirely community-owned, meaning anyone could use it to create their own content (monetized or not). I also want to launch 4 tower defence game fields, developed through the tower defence kit. These would act as examples on how to use the kit and provide the community with more entertainment content.\n\nThe end goal of the module would be to pull in a gaming-oriented audience to create a community that not only consumes content, but also produces it. One of the reasons a tower defence module was chosen for development is the highly innate modularity of the game genre. The game’s mechanics remain static across different fields of play, but the game can still feel fresh and engaging through different environments and the addition of new enemies/towers could be easily accomplished by community creators. The game type also caters to a wide variety of monetization options (pay-per-play, pay-for-access, etc) that landowners could use to provide premium experiences through.\n\nSo, here’s the part where you come in! I’m looking for some community input on how high the quality of the included assets should be (and how much should be spent on them). There are many different ways of sourcing assets available to us, which will result in highly variable outcomes. I’ve put together some of our options for asset generation, as well as the estimated cost of the project.\n\nBrief visual asset list: 8 towers, 6 enemy types, 4 environments.\nThese assets would require models, textures, animations, as well as being optimized to run well in Decentraland’s environment.\n\n(15k - 25k) If we focus purely on a functional aesthetic/bare-bones graphics we can save a large portion of funding. These assets would likely be created in-house/by community members, so keeping a doctrine of how to create new assets would also be easy. While the art might not be fantastic, the module would still serve its purpose and the included assets could always be updated at a later time.\n\n(25k - 40k) Hiring quality freelancers would give us a median point on quality. Freelancers are quite competitive in the visual design space and finding able professionals would not be an issue. This could also provide us with assets of varying theme/art style if we start with one freelancer then move to another due to availability issues.\n\n(40k - 55k) One of the best options for the highest quality assets would be to partner with an art outsourcing studio. This would be the most expensive, but would result in the highest quality assets for the project. Many game development companies outsource their art through these studios and all that really has to be done on our part is provide our chosen partner with a detailed list of specifications/theming/concept.\n\nSo, with those options out in the open, I want to start a conversation about what our target and approach should be before diving too deep into design documentation for this module. Do you think we should start with the tower defence genre or a different one like social games (among us)? Should we stick to creating primarily functional creation kits or spend additional funding to populate them with high quality assets?\n\n- Create with a low visual design budget, focusing mainly on functionality\n- Create with a medium visual design budget, through freelancers\n- Create with a high visual design budget, through a studio\n- We do not need a module like this right now\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8a23cb00-4e5d-11ed-abb3-973d82c8ef3b)**",

Our current endeavor to create one of the most amazing community led games requires us to have an ingame marketplace so our items can be purchased and sold within Decentraland thanks to the rarible protocol. A previous proposal was done by HPrivakos however was not completed (https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=691c8e60-f3c8-11eb-ab97-bfa89f33c258).\n\nWe expect to fulfill the implementation of the rarible SDK with support for Ethereum and Polygon networks.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n24,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x03651FEf8b3deA464D3b2BE5a0050742547cE0e9\n\n## Email address\n\nhello@stellargate.io\n\n## Description\n\nWe, Stellar Gate, are creating a new type of FPS/RTS game within Decentraland and believe that the Rarible Protocol is needed to continue our endeavors in Decentraland. We believe this technology will also be of great benefit to all Decentraland community as it will give more power to land owners and NFT creators (whether these may be artists, game devs, etc)\n\nRarible launched a few months back Rarible protocol. This new product allows us to integrate marketplaces in Decentraland and more. Some of the benefits are the ability to create a marketplace within DCL and sell products within DCL without the need to be redirected into another website like opensea.

Our current endeavor to create one of the most amazing community led games has led us to invest 7 months worth of developing time to a new type of POAP delivery which we call Controller of Attendance Token (C.A.T.)\n\nC.A.T. has been tested many times for now and refined in the delivery process of POAP in various events. We now seek to make this service available for DCL community. Therefore, we will need to refine it more so LAND owners can implement this technology in their LAND and be able to deliver POAP through task completion.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x03651FEf8b3deA464D3b2BE5a0050742547cE0e9\n\n## Email address\n\nhello@stellargate.io\n\n## Description\n\nWe seek to further develop C.A.T. in order for DCL LAND owners to distribute POAP for their event in a custom way. Some examples of what this technology can do is provide POAP to players by completing tasks during a specified period of time. Check the amount of falls each player has had. Verify human behavior and more.\n\nHere we have posted one video of C.A.T. working:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgV3K6ibdhE\n\nWe will have an event in collaboration with Bored Ape Pizza Club this upcoming saturday 22nd in which you can check how CAT can be used.\n\nhttps://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=a471d30e-3aa2-44f6-9936-143e1cdedaf4\n\nWe believe POAP can be distributed in a more engaging way and more responsibly. This grant will also allow us to offer this service for free for a limited period of time.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nGOALS:\n\n\\-Custom POAP Delivery as specified by developer\n\n\\-User Validations to ensure security and reliability\n\n\\-POAP-CAT event management interface within Promethei Terra\n\n\\-Provide per event access on CAT Services to property owners in Decentraland\n\nDecentraland POAP Delivery\n\nA task based feature included in the delivery process providing Decentraland Metaverse Property Owners with the possibility for users to spend some time in the scene or to reach or visit specific areas inside the property before actually committing the POAP minting process.\n\nPOAP Event Management Interface\nA Decentraland Scene ready UI that allows Decentraland Metaverse LAND Owners, LAND Administrators and Decentraland Users to subscribe and sign up to CAT Services\nToken based distribution of event grants\nA token will be distributed among CAT Service users allowing the use of CAT Services per event\n\nSecurity\nDecentraland Metaverse Property ownership validations along with an optional captcha validation method and user activity records to ensure that every user will enjoy advanced security measures in the POAP delivery process.\n\nToken based distribution of event grants\nA token will be distributed among CAT Service users allowing the use of CAT Services per event.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nWe are dedicating Stellar Gate personnel resources into the completion of this project:\n\nJorge Bartra - Stellar Gate Project Lead | will oversee operations and completion of add on\n\nLuis Grisolia - Stellar Gate Lead Dev | will refine CAT for usage by DCL community\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe estimate for refinements to be completed within a month and a half.

In the first part, a scientific paper aims to provide insights into the diverse userbase of decentraland by using qualitative and quantitative research methods. The second part of this idea consists of developing an  opensource user interface for creators to use on the parcels and collect qualitative data from the visitors.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n16,450 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x78B850B0f8728de91a392D79011d183f44d01d08\n\n## Email address\n\nrzdominik@protonmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nHello, my name is Domo aka. BigMouth.eth\n\nI am currently enrolled in the last term of my masters degree in digitalization, innovation and information management. Searching for a suitable topic for my masters thesis, I wanted to use this opportunity to do something nobody did before (I think). By asking the DAO to fund my scientific mark research, I want to work fulltime on providing value to Decentraland and it's creators.\n\nThe idea is to develop and formulate proper questionaires and do a research on the userbase on decentraland. A scientific approach is enforced by the University I am currently enroled in and brings a certain level of quality and effort into this research (it is my masters degree).\n\nAfter presenting the results of my own research, I want to provide a framework, which enables creators to do similar questionaires and ultimately collect valuable feedback through beautiful user interfaces and easy-to-setup backends (+data storage) from inside the Metaverse.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis Masters thesis is about analysing the userbase of decentraland and propose an opensource framework for creators and brands to use to better understand and target existing and potential customers within their virtual experiences.\n\nBy using a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methods (interviews, questionaires, blockchain analysis, live calls, ingame interfaces) I want to find answers to some of the most difficult questions:\nWho are the different  decentraland players (users, creators, developers, comittee, staff), what is their motivation, expectations, dreams and fears. The results of this research should help shine a light on the mayority as well as minorities in the decentraland community to better understand their needs and ultimately create a better experience for everyone.\n\nThe second part of this proposal consists of designing and developing an easy-to-setup  interface for creators to use on their parcels and continue the research beyond this scientific research.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nDomo aka. BigMouth.eth\n(I prefer to stay semi-anonymous in this proposal, but definitely plan to release my full identity to the public as I get closer to the release of the scientific paper.)\n\nBeing 4+ years in the crypto space (and a super early player of decentraland), I have  build a huge network of creators in DCL and beyond, having experience as a corporate social media manager and change manager surely helped me with that. Especially my Giveaway and advisory activities have helped many creators getting started in the space.\n\nFurthermore, I have already written a compareable scientific paper (my bachelors thesis), which can be found here: https://github.com/Utopianer/Bachelorthesis\n\nMy DMs on Twitter are always open: https://twitter.com/BigMouthMeta\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis proposal is divided into two main parts, which can be broken down into more specific steps.\n\nPart 1:\nThe work begins with the research of relevant literature and sources regarding the customer base analysis. The scientific research methods need to be defined and approved from the professors. The base salary of a student working in a corporate environment on a compareable masters thesis is around 1000$ per month (6x1000=6000$).\n\nPart 2:\nThe most essential part of this proposal is the development of a user interface, which can be easily deployed by land owners. In order to do so, I need to rent land, develop a built (2000$) and hire my friend and decentraland wearable creator Metadojo (https://twitter.com/MetaDojo) to design a user interface and optimize the user experience for visitors and land owners (3000$). Furthermore, different forms of rewards will be used to drive attention and participation on the project. Several wearables will be designed and created by famous creators like Michi Todd (2000$ + submission fees). Furthermore, a developer needs to be hired (from decentraland verified creators) to assist me with the backend development and setup tutorial (3000$). A dedicated Server is required as well (~250$ for 6 months).\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=3eeea430-4c13-11ed-a234-ef1b91ca21e2)**",

    "title": "Should POI names be assigned in the POI proposal or should we continue to let land owners change their POI at will?",
    "body": "> by 0xc375b0a133f49dbf3c6418895d6d024be2d8f84a (noh0mie)\n\nProblem:\nCurrently the POI proposal process only asks for three data fields when applying:\n\n1.  The land location coordinates of the proposed POI\n2.  A brief description of why you think your land should be approved as a POI\n3.  Any co-author wallet addresses\n\nWith this current structure players are not required to assign a name to their POI at the time of applying. While many proposals do mention the intended name of their POI, others do not and this creates confusion as well as potential for abuse in the following situations:\n\n1.  Confusion - Voting players are not always clear on what the intended POI name is being there is no name data field. Land owners who want to share with the community their intended name can only include this in the description.\n2.  Confusion - The proposed POI name in the proposal description can be different than the existing land name when players visit in world to review the POI. Players are not required to have their land name set to the proposed POI name.\n3.  Abuse - Players could apply for a POI under one name and following approval change it to something different than the proposed name. This can be used to mislead voting players into approving a POI name they do not support or find offensive.\n\nWhile currently we do have a check and balance to this with the ability to vote to remove a POI if an owner we're to act maliciously, I'm not sure this is the best system. Due to this I would like to hear the community opinion on adding an name field to the POI proposal.\n\nSolution:\nThe way I would see this functioning is the ability for an owner to submit a name change in the land manager would be locked if it is currently active as a POI. Land owners who do not have an active POI will continue to be able to change their land name freely.\n\nAppendix:\nI would also like to note I'm aware it may not be possible to make this change with the way the contract function for changing the plot name / description is set up being you must sign a tx to make this change. I imagine this could be at the least hidden on the front end similar to how the ability to list items below 1 mana was on polygon for sometime, but players would still be able to call the contract function with some technical know-how. For this to work fully however calling of that function would have to be blocked to active POI owners. If someone with more knowledge of the DCL land contract and how the front end interacts with it could offer some clarity it would be appreciated.\n\nPlease feel free to share your thoughts in the comments below, I look forward to the discussion and others opinions on the matter.\n\n- Make no changes to the POI name system\n- POI names should be assigned in the proposal, owners must reapply to change name\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=21bcd0f0-4a68-11ed-bdf3-75f4f4d9ef2f)**",

My initial idea is that music nfts in dcl can be the equivalent of digital vinyl. Whereby owning the NFT gives you the right to play music in venues that have a smart item that is the equivalent of a DJ booth. This would allow DJs to only play music when making use of the aforementioned smart item and owning the corresponding NFT.\n\nPros:\n\n*   gated music at select venues\n*   revenue for music producers who create music solely for Decentraland audiences\n*   the first and only music nft with in-game utility\n*   reminiscent of the days when DJs would carry vinyl to events\n\nCons:\n\n*   inability to mix tracks appropriately through a smart item\n*   at the start very small pool of music NFTs to choose from\n*   not a better option than streaming music from outside dcl into world\n\n2.  Another idea could be to have music NFTs which are minted by users as a way to add songs to a smart item jukebox that can only be populated by music NFTs that a landowner owns or that a user has in their wallet.\n\nPros:\n\n*   simple setup and easily understandable\n*   on-chain verifiability that a landowner/user owns certain music records, similar to wearables whereby your taste can be expressed by what you show off\n*   can be left passively on your property to add an interaction for your visitors\n\nCons:\n\n*   can easily set up a jukebox with any music that is not an NFT\n\n3.  A third idea could be a fan engagement/benefits type model whereby all music minted on the DCL marketplace comes with particular benefits that are decided upon by the artist and could be a way for fans to support up-and-coming artists before they are famous with in-world or IRL benefits.\n\nPros:\n\n*   Can be applied to famous artists to enhance the engagement of fans\n*   Can be paired with in-world concerts and meetups to promote album sales as well as IRL events\n*   A low-budget option allows anyone to get in early and benefit from an artist blowing up (might be free but limited supply could result in minted music becoming collectible down the line)\n\nCons:\n\n*   How to ensure promises are kept\n\n***\n\nI am extremely open to further deliberation and ideas.\n\nThere is no wrong or right questions, comments or suggestions.\n\nI believe that the concept I am proposing is extremely unique and can potentially create another stream of income for the DAO which is currently unsustainable with its outflows of MANA$\n\nIn the poll choose your favourite idea. If you're thinking of mix and matching the concepts, please leave your comments below. Please do get in touch if this idea resonates with you! I would love to brainstorm.\n\nBest regards,\nLuca Arrigo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-arrigo/\n\n- Sounds good, formalize your thoughts and make a proposal\n- Your ideas sound whack, go home\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a4d1c2a0-48ee-11ed-bdf3-75f4f4d9ef2f)**",

    "title": "The DCL Report Increasing Awareness and Empowering Community",
    "body": "> by 0xd2d950cea649feef4d6111c18adbd9a37b3a9f63 (Report)\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nSince January 2021 The Decentraland Report has been a platform for community members to join as reporters and preserve the history of the metaverse. By increasing the reach and the educational, interactive content provided through this platform, we bring attention to the proof of concept of the creator economy created through the DCL Report, the potential of creation and benefiting the entire Decentraland ecosystem and Metaverse enthusiasts around the globe.\n\nOur surveys show high user satisfaction, retention, and an active creative economy. We offer valuable opportunities which allow members to receive both crypto and fiat rewards. This model has received recognition around the world and in mainstream media.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe8C599568Fb76884C1100278A0430011067707Ec\n\n## Email address\n\nkevinonearth999@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nThis grant aims to bring awareness to:\n\n1.  Attract more users and creators to Decentraland and 2) Empower the DCL Report ecosystem to reach independent/ sustainable growth path towards their mission (without depending on DAO support for video editors, server and operational costs).\n\nThe Decentraland Report team has been preserving the history of the metaverse since January 2021, as well as partaking into the present and building the future of the Metaverse. The work and content creation efforts to date brought Decentraland the attention of hundreds of thousands of people around the globe. As seen on Major News Networks such as CBS, NBC, Cointelegraph, and more, The DCL Report has grown by developing meaningful experiences around easily discovering and joining Decentraland. However, many creators/developers/designers have yet to discover ways to start exploring the Metaverse.\n\nThe DCL Report didn’t just impact and change the way we interacted and shared immersive experiences but also how we created value. To prepare for a growing community, our team completed development of an automated rewards system which delivers our $REPORT tokens and NFTs via a smart contract. This initiative was accomplished with the help of community sponsors and the Decentraland DAO to solve problems in user retention and scalability.\n\nFor example, the increasing size of the community would be limited by the amount of prizes a person could manually send. By successfully automating this, we now are able to keep our $REPORT token distribution fair, transparent, and gives our DAO the potential to remain a platform for the community members to tell their story as they build and participate in the metaverse.\n\nOur decentralized news network, by creators for creators, is a reputable and cost effective method to generate content about Decentraland and how to be part of it. In addition, it gives community members an open platform they can participate in at various levels. Whether as a reporter, or viewers using their $REPORT tokens to reserve coverage.\n\nOur goal is not to depend on DAO funding to sustain The Decentraland Report all along the journey. We have budgeted this grant funding accounting for our needs for our biggest awareness campaign yet to reach creators around the world (i.e. developers, designers, video editors, community managers, social media/marketing director), and the goals it will enable within the timeline needed to become sustainable financially and prove our model moving forward.\n\nTo address sustainability a SaaS business model has been established. Through a strategic partnership with Xpand.GG, The DCL Report retains 90% of revenue from donations and recurring subscriptions on our community page. Through Xpand, we can automatically divide revenues across our team.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nCrafted videos explaining how to access the ecosystem. We will ensure a social media presence, AB testing for landing pages to perfect messaging. Through this we aim to bring over 100k members through The Decentraland Report.\n\nWith essential infrastructure to support our growth in place, we envision bringing like minded creators who will be positive contributing members of the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nWe aim to reach individuals within the following demographic:\nAges 18 - 34 (Primary), 35-44 (secondary)\nIndividuals Curious/ Active in Web3 & Metaverse\nUniversity/Higher Education Student & Faculty\nBackgrounds in Computer Science, Design, Music, and Art\n\nWe will focus on placing content within relevant contexts for specific goals; General content to attract new audience i.e. blender tutorial videos, and specific content about current community efforts and bringing awareness to what is currently being done i.e. DCL Report DAO voted highlighted projects each month, opening the space for more creators to partake in this revolutionary time to be for artists who want to belong to a community, feel recognized and contribute to this value creation. The content will be optimized for specific audience on social media channels. The associated campaign budget will be allocated according to performance results from data generated through metrics (impression, engagement, CTR).\n\nWhile content is hosted on each Reporters individual channels, content is also now hosted across DCL Report social and content channels. The budget allocation below is a framework for spending which will allow us to optimize content, targeting and reach to ultimately achieve our goals of this campaign.\n\nReporter Equipment (Camera, Lighting, Microphone; $4,000/reporter) - $32,000\nTargeted Advertising Placement - $30,000 (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Global Guerilla Marketing using Visual Impact Driven Audio/Visual Pieces, Other)\nProject Manager - $24,000\nMarketing Director - $24,000\nReporter Generated Micro-Content - $24,000 ($500/Month/Reporter)\nLead Video Editor - $24,000\nContent Manager - $15,000\nChief Newsletter Editor - $15,000\nGraphic Designer/3D modeler for Campaign Content - $15,000\nIRL Event Presence and Attendance Budget (5 events attended) - $15,000\nGiveaway/Prizes Funds - $12,000 ($2k/month)\nWeb Design - $10,000\n\nAd spend will happen in various phases. 25% of the initial advertising spend will be used to optimize messaging and audience targeting. The remaining 75% of advertising will be used to reach our growth goal and empower our community to always have a platform where they can be heard and tell their story as we build the metaverse.\n\nBy watching and subscribing to our channel on Xpand (Call to Action) they will earn all these rewards, learn how to navigate the metaverse effectively, and use the $REPORT tokens acquired to have their projects covered when they decide to release work themselves.\n\nWe will also execute a strategy around IRL event presence/ coverage and speaking engagements, which will bolster networking opportunities to connect with individuals inside the web3 space, but also individuals outside of Decentraland seeking to discover web3 possibilities in the “real-world”.\n\nThe events which we are targeting includes: DCentralMiami, ETH San Francisco, Consensus, International Conference on Internet of Things Based on Blockchain (ICIOTBB), Blockchain Africa Conference.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nOperations\nFounder - KevinOnEarth999 (www.ImagineOnEarth.com)\nProject Manager - PinkBambii (https://pinkandshades.com/)\nMarketing Director - Nicole Nixon (https://www.nicolenixon.net/)\nGraphic Designer/3D modeler - Sango of the East\nCGI and Animations - Cinetica.Studios\nLead Video Editor - Szjanko, Nadim (Over a decade of News Channel & Editing Experience)\nContent Manager - Stefan\nChief Newsletter Editor - Lina (Creator of The Wearables Daily Newsletter)\n\nReporters\nMaryana - Mondays from 11PM UTC to Tuesday 12AM UTC\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/maryanadcl\n\nFractillians - Tuesday from 12AM UTC to 1AM UTC\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/fractilians\n\nKevinOnEarth - Tuesdays from 11PM UTC to Wednesday 12AM UTC  & Thursdays from 11PM UTC to Friday 12AM  https://www.twitch.tv/KevinOnEarth999\n\nMetaTrekkers - Wednesdays from 1AM UTC to 2AM UTC\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/metatrekkers\n\nFriskyBumbleBee - Wednesdays from 11PM UTC to Thursday https://www.twitch.tv/friskybumblebee\n\nMoustafa - Thursdays from 4PM UTC to 5PM UTC\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/MoustafaSb\n\nFabinho - Fridays from 11PM UTC to Saturday 12AM UTC\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/fabinhodcl\n\nIna_DCL - Saturdays from 6PM UTC to 7PM UTC\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/ina_dcl\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nTo see our progress to date you can take a look at our Gitbook: https://kevin-on-earth.gitbook.io/the-decentraland-report-or-a-p2e-news-channel/\n\nTo be sure we were ready to bring awareness to the potential of the creator economy we’ve proven, we conducted various surveys and analysis across our platform. While the web3 community sentiment has certainly shifted with the current market conditions, our audience has continued to stay engaged.\n\nUsing Qualtrics 2to measure Net Promoter Score of 66, which is held as an Excellent Net Promoter Score. Here are some of the responses as to WHY people scored this way and why we believe it is time that we spread the word about The Decentraland Report:\n\n“It is the soul of Decentraland.

    "body": "> by 0xe18118afd116bb77549f8d4694b3261426dcde10 (lio#de10)\n\nShould the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe at Cinetica Studio want to support the growth of promising creatives in the Decentraland ecosystem by providing them with high quality CGI animated content to promote events, brands, creators, and the overall Decentraland Ecosystem.\n\nFor our first contribution we will develop two (2) CGI animated teasers for The DCL Report both to support their efforts to grow their community, as well as to demonstrate the unique kind of Decentraland Content we are able to create for the ecosystem. This would include:\n\n1.  Level design or virtual world creation\n2.  Custom Motion capture animations\n3.  Virtual camera placement and rendering with Unreal Engine\n4.  Basic editing and sound design\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xF2cB497Ec3fE52D92B29466c0B369A1fEe0199FD\n\n## Email address\n\nlio@cinetica.studio\n\n## Description\n\nTeaser 1: \"A Hook - Discover and Preserve the History of the Metaverse\"\nA short 15 second animated video showing The Decentraland Report \"reporter\" discovering and contemplating for the first time the presence of the iconic character AVA, co created by the world known film director Michael Bay, a true historic moment in the metaverse that will be documented and archived as a milestone in the web3 space.\n\nTeaser  2: “Plant the seed - Unveiling a historic moment in the discovery of the metaverse”\nA short 30 second animated video extending the sublime interaction between the decentraland reporter and  AVA, this will be the first showcase of AVA´s true purpose in the metaverse, we will hint the viewers through a \"easter egg\" the true reason for AVA´s presence in the metaverse without revealing too much information. It is important to establish in this video the beginning of a story that reflects consciousness and awareness of our planet's current climate change crisis. AVA has landed into the metaverse to spread a message of hope and preservation, a message that is truly worthy of being documented by \"The Decentraland Report '' and rendered in a breathtaking style.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nCinetica Studio will develop the project in 3 steps, according to the following Hardware and Software specs:\n\n1.  Asset development and level design: we will compose and assemble all the assets required in both Maya and Blender in order to export as optimized meshes inside Unreal Engine 5, once assets are imported we will proceed with the level design and construction by using both in engine tools as well as purchased marketplace assets to complement the story. By using UE5 we will take full advantage of its path tracing features as well as Lumen and Nanite.\n\n2.  Avatar integration: The avatars incorporated into the scenes are purchased NFT´s which provide access to their 3D files, therefore we will work as well on the rigging for the models. We will bring to life our characters by using both inertial and optical motion capture systems from the companies Noitom and Optitrack; all captured data will be streamed into UE5 through the livelink protocol, allowing us to then add facial expressions and specific details.\n\n3.  Cinematics: Once we have assembled all pieces together in UE5, we will proceed with the sequence and camera animations, we will work on this part of the project side by side with our studio´s DOP. Once the sequence is ready, all files are exported in EXR format in order to compose and color correct in after effects and davinci.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nCinetica studio has worked on numerous projects for the Film, Entertainment, Music and video game industry. We have collaborated with world known Directors, such as Alejandro G. Iñarritu (Birdman, The revenant..) as well as Worldwide pop stars like Bad Bunny, Snoop Dog, Kanye and many  more. We have created high impact content for transnational brands such as Corona, Philipp Plein, Gucci and more.\n\nCinetica is built by a team of 20 in house artists, for this project we will involve the following artists profiles:\n\n1 Sr. Level designer with expertise in UE pipeline\n1 Jr. Level designer with expertise in Blender and Maya\n1 Sr Character designer with expertise in UE pipeline\n1 Mocap Director\n1 Mocap technician\n1 Mocap Supervisor\n1 Mocap talent\n1 Creative Director\n1 Writer\n\npls find below the websites corresponding to the parties involved in the development and creative process of the piece.\n\nCinetica Studio: https://www.cinetica.studio/\nThe DCL Report https://www.TheDecentralandReport.com\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe will deliver the totality of the project 2 months after the grant is approved, it is very important for us to establish a community and grow awareness of both the project we are creating, but also  decentralands ability to listen to its community and impulse them towards growing as artists in the web3 space.  The general public will receive recorded behind the scenes footage from the Motion Capture sessions in order to maintain engagement with the making of process, as well different Q\\&A sessions  will be organized among the community of future content creators in order to explain how modern animation pipelines look like.\n\nWe want to democratize the way content is created  today and open the eyes of the next generations making them conscious of  the power and ability  they have as creative minds to detonate a positive impact in the world.\n\nTo make this happen, the first 4 weeks (w1 to w4) we will pre produce and produce all the content required for the 2 short videos, and  for the next 4 weeks (w4 to w8) we will begin to share on a weekly basis in both Cinetica Studio and The Decentraland Report social media channels the content we will have previously prepared in the first 4 weeks.\n\nThe first 15 second teaser will be shown by the end of week 4, in order to engage with the community and bring up the expectations, but while the marketing and community campaign for the project is launched from week 4 to 8, we will simultaneously be polishing the final touches of part 2.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1d2927b0-48aa-11ed-bdf3-75f4f4d9ef2f)**",

Our current endeavor to create one of the most amazing community led games requires us to have an ingame marketplace so our items can be purchased and sold within Decentraland thanks to the rarible protocol. A previous proposal was done however was not completed (https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=691c8e60-f3c8-11eb-ab97-bfa89f33c258).

We believe this technology will also be of great benefit to all Decentraland community as it will give more power to land owners and NFT creators (whether these may be artists, game devs, etc)\n\nRarible launched a few months back Rarible protocol. This new product allows us to integrate marketplaces in Decentraland. This will allow everyone to run their marketplace within DCL and sell products within DCL without the need to be redirected into another website like opensea. Land owners can even earn from fees generated by the sale of NFTs. We specially are aiming for NFTs on the Polygon network to be available upon integration.\n\nHPrivakos began to work on this add on however was unable to complete it.

    "body": "> by 0x0636211443e91468ee3657e1d7faede7059c4843 (Brewery)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Add the option to upload profile pictures (PFP) to Decentraland Names](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2d4541a0-2858-11ed-ac99-5bece7edccd0)\n\n## Summary\n\nAdd customizable PFPs and attach social detail to Decentraland Names.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nPersonalisation of Decentraland Names is key - right now it can be hard for a Name to stand out with every NFT displaying the same generic background.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, on the Decentraland Marketplace, Names appear on a grey background in white font with no option of customisation - allowing custom PFP's adds an additional layer of uniqueness to every Name. This simple yet effective option will help highlight and distinguish one Name from another whilst adding further utility and awareness.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nENS allows users to add many social links to individual domains, Decentraland should be no different. Linking social details to specific Names will help users get in contact when collaborating/negotiating.\n\nUsers could personalise their Names so they are easier to recognise or to display their hobbies/passions. Companies, businesses and brands would be able to display logos/slogans etc to their corresponding Name. Additionally, this could make it easier to differentiate specific names when browsing Names for sale.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThis proposal would collectively benefit every current & future owner of Decentraland Names with the additional utility of personalisation. Also, this will help Names stand out when viewing on the Decentraland Marketplace and other Marketplaces like Opensea.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nDecentraland Names leverages ENS as subdomains of parent domain, dcl.eth. ENS have these features by default, with the option to upload a custom Avatar and more (PFP) to your ENS NFT's.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDecentraland Names will no longer be dull and grey - The future is bright!\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a35aaf80-47dc-11ed-9eb2-21be7ab68113)**",

We want to create a platform that makes it possible for all users in Decentraland to make reviews of businesses or people they have dealt with, and to make a complaint against a business or people that they have dealt with.\n\nThe main functions of the platform will be to review DCL businesses, report scams, and advice on the general safety in DCL.\n\nThe platform will act as an open registry where everyone can make a review or report scam. All users will have full access to the platform to create, review, report and to view the registries.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n59,920 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xa7f9756bC9D51AA3b3c71F79392Ea8C685F10766\n\n## Email address\n\ntrustindcl@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZGihlwK.png)\n*****THE GOAL IS SAFETY.*****\n\n*This project is here to protect all users from people that is taking advantage of DCL users, and a review platform of trustworthy businesses and also share bad experiences. This is an open platform, where everybody can report but also review people and businesses with complete freedom of speech.*\n\n**1. The Report Registry:**\n\nThe project will function as a website and a Discord, where users can report people and businesses. The report registry will function as a database that stores reports and complaints from users regarding scam. Everyone will be able to create a report and complaint, and the only filter there will be is the team that will filter trolls and non serious written reports. The result of this registry will be that now every DCL user can look up other users and businesses that they are doing business with to see if there is anyone else that has done business with them and has had good or bad reputation. (Upvote and downvote of reports will also be possible)\n\n**2. The Review Registry:**\n\nThe project will feature a forum where users can review businesses and users that they have done business with. It is an open forum with close to no centralisation. That means we will not enforce or censor anything, but be a foundation for safety and reviewing. The reviewer will be able to post anything they would like to - the team behind will only filtrate for trolls and the likes. (Upvote and downvote of reviews will also be possible)\n\n**3. Scam Prevention, Advice & Help Center**\n\nThe website will also host a section for advice to help the users of Decentraland to fare the Metaverse in safety. The Scam Prevention & Advice will have the function to help the users prepare themselves for the “dangers” of trading and doing business in Decentraland. The help center will also have a FAQ section. Users will be able to create threads with a question and other users will be able to answer the questions. Furthermore, there will be a general safety guide that will instruct the users on how to stay safe and avoid scammers/swindlers in DCL. The guide will involve the safest places to do business in Decentraland and refer to the positive rated reviews in The Review Registry.\n\n**4. And much more:**\n\n*   Other than the website, there will also be a Discord server which will be a more interactive version of the website. The Discord will have staff ready to assist and answer questions for users who need it, regarding the functionality of the Discord/website.\n\n*   The project will also include a DCL in-game office that will function as an informative office, where users can gather information in-game and be pointed towards the website and/or Discord.\n\n*   We are making a safespace for all users in DCL to validate the ones they are doing honest business with and report those who aren't honest. Check up on the businesses and users you do business with and report businesses and users that have acted in a deceitful way or create a review of their business.\n\n**Let's make DCL a safer place together!**\n\n*We need your help to make this project. If this project is granted funding, the community will become a safer place for everyone. This project will make DCL a much more honest environment.*\n\n\n## Specification\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WO1gVPX.png)\n*****THE EXECUTION OF THE PROJECT*****\n\nThe project will have 100% fully transparent registries where all users in the world can access. \"Trust In DCL\" will distance itself from being the judge, the jury and the executioner - instead being an informative platform for the users of DCL to help each other and educate themselves. By acting on these terms, Trust In DCL will not be able to be subject to any forms of untrustworthy and favouring.\n\n**Transparency and mission**:\n\nThe project will be transparent and provide safety advice on how to make sure new users can avoid scammers, but also a place where people can make general complaints & issues about their experience in DCL. People will also be able to review their experience with businesses in DCL, so people can share their experiences about DCL companies of all kinds. Daily operations will be focused on advising users, making blog-posts about safety in DCL - making improvements to the platform, and removal of spam posts from the registry - and updating the registries on the platform. This will be done to ensure quality and transparency for the community, and none-bias reports & registries for the community. Users will be able to see user-feedback and reviews without centralisation, self-interest and biasness getting in the way.\n\n**Specification Explained:**\n\n*   The website will be built with help from the team-members and external developers.\n*   The main functions will be: The Report Registry, The  Review Registry & Scam Prevention, Advice & Help Center.\n\n**HOW TO REPORT A SCAM/COMPLAINT & PROCESS**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CADuAaL.png)\n\n*   *The Report Registry will function as an user friendly model that will be made as a fill out step by step form. To start, the user will enter the website and click “The Report Registry” and then start to fill out a form. In the form, the user will start out with filling out his name and meaterversi information. Then the user will fill out a report form with several steps to get the most detailed report. When the form is complete, it will automatically be posted in “The Report Registry” open for all users to view, comment and share.*\n\n**HOW TO REVIEW A BUSINESS & PROCESS**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2qO0mbR.png)\n\n*   *The Review Registry will be built by the same method as The Report Registry, but adopted to the means of reviewing a business. The user will fill out a business review form and fill it out step by step. Then it will be published in “The Review Registry” (only Decentraland businesses and activity can be reviewed here).*\n\n**SCAM PREVENTION, ADVICE & HELP CENTER**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GUsdjkj.png)\n\n*   *Scam Prevention, Advice & Help Center will be its own division and will host different functions, such as an FAQ regarding many diverse questions about the different elements of a scam: prevention, what to do when being scammed, how to report etc. Another function will be the Advice section, where there will be a live-chat for users with questions that are not answered in FAQ. The last function will be the Information section, which will act as a collection of relevant information about online safety, metaverse security and avoiding being scammed, so that the blog-posts are up-to-date with the crypto and Decentraland space.*\n\n**DEMO VERSION OF THE SITE:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/71qzWDh.png)\n\n*This is a demo page that is subject to change. This is for visual purposes only.*\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VZ3uSgS.png)\n\n**MEET THE TEAM**\n\n*The team is made of dedicated people, whom already help many new users every day, which helps with onboarding and understanding of how to get started in DCL, and it's key elements.

The book will not only bring people to experience the city, streets, lands, buildings, avatar, wearables, arts, events, moving, seeing, acting etc. in the new world, but also teach people to understand the underlying logic of FT, NFT, DAO, smart contract, governmental token, DeFi, P2E etc.\n\nThis project will benefit DCL in many aspects, at least including:\n\n*   Reach 1.4 billion people who are mostly clueless but eager to know about metaverse;\n*   Lift DCL industry fame world-widely;\n*   Open a permanent and high-quality channel to absorb new user steams;\n*   Lay the foundation of people’s understanding in DCL as the most classic metaverse in the world;\n*   Much more potential opportunities in the future.\n\nTo fulfill this task, we need your supports on the grant to cover part of related expenses including Team compensation, operational cost, expert consultation fee, publishing cost, etc.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWhat we have done:\n\n1.  We have entered a contract with China Machine Press (CMP) to publish “The underlying logic of the metaverse” within 6 months. CMP is a very classic, famous, and popular press established in 1952 in China. It’s one of the largest comprehensive science & technology publishing houses in China. After publishing, CMP will promote the book by their own broad channels such as Tiktok, Dangdang, jd.com… as well as various offline resources. BTW, Dangdang is the largest online bookstore in China, much more famous than Amazon, locally speaking.\n2.  This book will be co-published with Shenzhen Software Industry Association which has 4,000 IT company members. The SSIA will also promote the book using their association networks.\n3.  We have outlined the first level of the catalog. It contains seven chapters. This framework has been reviewed and accepted by CMP and kind of fixed.\n4.  We have got the promise from CMP to receive the CIP and ISBN before the end of 2022, as long as everything goes within expectation.\n\nIf this grant is approved. We promise:\n\n*   DCL will be the main example for metaverse in the book;\n*   DCL will be the only user case in the book to guide the readers;\n*   DCL will cover at least 80% of the content of the book user case;\n*   DCL will cover at least 80% of the images/pictures of the book user case;\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**About us**\\\nWe are a national certified high-technology cooperation based in Shenzhen, mainland China.

    "title": "Zombieland Problem - Could we rent out empty/unused land automatically?",
    "body": "> by 0xb3696116df8b93cb550c383539004a54b6580d22\n\nLets set up a smart contract, similar to the Over the Reality Plattform. Here the description and link:\n\nhttps://www.overthereality.ai/blog/over-renting-smart-contracts-a-big-step-in-the-development-of-over/\n\nThe whole system is conceived to maximize OVRLand availability, limit monopoly risks, and solve the “Lost Keys/Zombie Land” problem while rewarding OVRLand owners.\n\nCreating smart leases for virtual lands presents some significant challenges. In particular, there are two potentially competing interests to compose:\n\nProperty rights: the owner has to be free to do whatever he wants with its OVRLands\nCollective/platform interests: maximizing the availability of a scarce resource, the OVRLands.\nOVRLands owners should be free to set the rental price they deem correct for their OVRLand, even though this could lead to very high rental prices.\nIn the medium term, market forces are expected to solve the pricing problem by aligning rental supply and demand. But what if the owner of the OVRLand sets a very high price and just forgets the OVRLand, or loses control of its private keys? The OVRLand would de-facto become unavailable.\n\nFinally, there is the “Lost Keys/Zombie Land” problem. What happens if the owner of an OVRLand loses the keys to its wallet or dies? Would that OVRLand be unavailable forever?\n\nTo overcome these challenges, we made all of the OVRLand rentable by default. The base price is ~3$ (in OVR) for 1 month period – on the next version of the SC, the base price will vary according to the number of minted neighboring OVRLands -. The OVRLand owner will have a 3-days window to decline the offer. He can also request a different price and a different renting period (multiples of 30 days). The OVRLand owner will be notified by e-mail and on the marketplace messaging board of the rental request. If the OVERLand owner does not respond within 3 days, his OVRLand will be rented for 1 month, and he will receive the basic rental rate.\n\nWith this system, the active owner of OVRLand can set the price he prefers for the rental of its OVRLand. But, even if the owner is not active, the OVRLand will generate a basic income for the owner and remain available to publishers.\nFurthermore, this system solves the “LostKeys/Zombie Land” problem since the OVRLand is always available for a 1-month rental period.\n\nAn OVRLand owner will be able to modify his basic rental request, both in terms of value and time. For example, he can set the minimum monthly price to 50 $, the minimum renting period to 3 months, and the maximum to 6 months.\nMoreover, he could make the OVRLand virtually unavailable by setting a very high monthly rent request.\nThis Custom Request will be valid for 3 months (avoiding the “Lost Keys/Zombie Land” problem). It will have a small cost – ~0.50$ in OVR – to disincentivize monopoly behaviors on large quantities of OVRLands.\n\nThis is just the first version of OVRLand Renting Smart Contracts. The described rules are our best estimate of an optimal OVRLand rental management policy. However, we believe that the final decision on how to manage OVRLand smart contracts at best should be made by the OVRLand owner community.\nSuch decisions will be handled by a DAO, which will be published on the Polygon blockchain. Meanwhile, we invite interested parties to join Discord to discuss renting policy optimization.\n\n- yes - lets do it\n- no - we have a better idea\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e85b7b40-44cc-11ed-9eb2-21be7ab68113)**",

    "body": "> by 0x58754d9b3dbb4ddf5ac3502acb963743b15e6398 (Wolf)\n\nShould the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe are organising the biggest Devcon side event for approximately 1500 attendees at one of the top event venues in Bogota. The event will be broadcasted in Decentraland to enhance the whole experience. All the event, visitors both IRL and in Decentaraland will receive a wearable souvenir. This will add another layer to the way people experience web3 parties, by allowing anyone in the world to join the event and learn about Decentraland and Devcon. This will be accompanied by multiple brand placements related to Decentraland such as: animations on the main floor and a Decentraland branded floor including stickers,  a screen totem with QR codes to access the Decentraland website, and a physical 3d logo at the bar.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2a9Da28bCbF97A8C008Fd211f5127b860613922D\n\n## Email address\n\ncamilo.echeverri@thedac.info\n\n## Description\n\nAfter travelling the world and going to multiple conferences and hackathons, we realised that there are multiple things wrong with crypto events. Firstly, nobody knows which project is organising the event. Secondly, when visitors know the name of the organiser, they do not really engage with the sponsors in a proper way. Finally, empty dancefloors and “crypto bros” only entrance restrictions, make the party rather plain and not very engaging.\n\nFor this reason, we want to bring the MetaGameHub DAO expertise from creating state of the art metaverse experiences to the real world. We will organise the biggest Devcon side event at one of the blue chip clubs in Bogota and will broadcast it on Decentraland to enhance the experience. This will add another layer to the way we experience web3 parties, by allowing anyone in the world to join the event and learn about Decentraland and Devcon.\n\nThere will be three brands co-sponsoring the event. MetaGameHub DAO (https://www.metagamehub.io/), Fitchin (https://fitchin.gg/))  and Hacken (https://hacken.io/).\nFitchin focuses on bringing the esports industry to the web3 world.These brands, together with the exposure of Decentraland to over 1500 industry leaders, will make this the best side event of Devcon 2022.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nMetaPartyHub is the key that opens the portal to an intangible space which offers infinite possibilities. We want to create an immersive phygital experience that guides the visitors through multiple environments populated by light and art installations, brand placement and fine tunes. Visitors will find themselves immersed in a floor where physical and virtual elements will stimulate their senses, generating a unique experience. The trip through multiple portals will be immersed in clouds, laser lights, projections and lots of creativity.\nThis will be accompanied by multiple Decentraland related animations to generate enough brand placement. Additionally there will be a screen totem at the entrance  promoting Decentraland. Finally, there will be a \tDecentraland branded floor with stickers, a 150 x 150 x 35 cm Decentraland logo at the bar, another screen totem showcasing the metaverse party in DCL.\n\n**The Location**\n\nInspired by Berlin’s electronic scene, this place gives the city a space for trends and vanguard. It is closed and soundproof. The set of lights on the roof, accompanied by music will take attendees to ecstasy at the end of the night. The location has multiple floors that will enrich the experience in many ways. The main floor has three big projectors where the team will created Decentraland branded animations that will enrich the experience and generate brand placement. The Decentraland branded floor will be Babel (locations rooftop). To learn more about the location visit this page: https://theghettoproject.com/en/.\n\nThe metaverse location will be an estate with three parcels and the following coordinates:\n(-62,45),(-61,46),(-61,45)\n\nThe whole event (keynotes, live band and party) will be broadcasted on the main screen of the scene. There will be booths for the different sponsors and a place to showcase the wearable that will be gifted to the visitors.\nThis is a preview of the scene:https://youtu.be/UtxVZ0cjLJk\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**Nicolas Weber**\n\nRole: Founder\nRelevant Credentials (e.g.):\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas97weber/ 1\nBackground/Experience:\n\nCo-founder at EUTOK (European Blockchain Association)\n\\-Head of Business Development at Amazing Blocks AG\n\\-Founder & CEO DAC\n\\-Founder MGH DAO\n\n**Camilo Echeverri**\n\nRole: Co-Founder and Operations\nRelevant Credentials (e.g.):\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/caem2017/ 1\nBackground/Experience:\n\n\\-3 Years Experience in the indexing and banking industry\n\\-Co-founder DAC\n\\-Co-founder MGH DAO\n\n**Mauricio Beltran**\n\nRole: Audiovisual artist, 3D-2D Animator, Designer\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauricio-beltr%C3%A1n-377107211/\nBackgroud/Experience:\n\n\\-4 years experience in audiovisual production-filmmaking,\n\\-Video editing, 3D-2D animation and design\n\n**Diego Santa**\n\nRole: 3D Artist & designer JR\nRelevant Credentials (e.g.):\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-santa-067579220/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/digital_awreo/\nBackground/Experience:\n\n\\-2 Years experience in 3d Modeling and basic design projects\n\\-Light Skills Dojo artist\n\\-Plastic Arts student at Universidad Nacional de Colombia\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nDeliverables (Completion by 11.10.2022)\n\n*   Exposure to up to 1500 attendees from core Ethereum community\n*   Brand logo in all event-related promotion\n*   Decentraland branded floor including\n*   Screen totem x2 (At entrance and in Decentraland branded floor)\n*   Stickers (500)\n*   Decentraland  Logo 150 x 150 x 35 cm at the bar\n*   Event and party broadcast on Decentraland\n*   Location: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtxVZ0cjLJk\n*   Animations of Decentraland on all projections (IRL)\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bcd48260-42b9-11ed-9eb2-21be7ab68113)**",

Listen, I know MANY people like CK Bubbles, Chris Metatrekkers, Unknower, Matimio and more. I am very POPULAR!

I did all this work without showing any metrics for it. Not necessary. It's still a bear market, soon enough, my results will have proven a success.

Because if you give any of the following excuses, then I expect the same scrutiny for others:\n\n\\-\"It is a 'bogus' grant proposal.\" I would have to disagree. This is bringing to light to a problem.\n\n\\-\"You haven't proven yourself to the community.\" Does name dropping count?\n\n\\-\"You haven't proven your credibility or the ability to handle this type of money.\" Well I am credible. I have my own business and have handled a lot of money before.

It may have only taken me 10 minutes to write this proposal, but it took many hours of thoughts. You have paid others for their time, have you not?\n\n\\-\"You are providing no value.\" I most certainly am. This is a wakeup call that this DAO needs to get its crap together and start focusing on providing value. We need to bring people in and stop allowing this high school cliques to take over. The main question needs to be: \"what value is being provided for the community overall?\"\n\nIf any of these are your excuses when I confront you about voting \"No\" on this proposal, then it is clear, you are being hypocritical and bias. This proposal alone provides more value for DCL as a whole than anything else. Vote \"yes\" if you agree.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nI have no promises as this grant proposal on its own merit will do more to help Decentraland, than most of the recent grants.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nMyself, Tudamoon.

BTW did you hear me call you wonderful. ;) You know you love me inside! :P\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nSubmitting this proposal and getting the grant is the roadmap.

We need to re-create the play to earn model to draw in more players.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n25,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xd5879eCb96DF9a3c4584d7e1A49Ee53ba94104D3\n\n## Email address\n\nblockbakestudios@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nWe'll use MOCA as our curator for a 3 month tournament of art battles. We'll purchase the art and give away art the winner of each battle to one lucky player/voter.  The last battle will go down between all of the winners for the grand prize.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe're using our custom voting system utilizing POAP dispensers, firebase, and custom SDK code.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nWe're co-founders from Columbus, OH.  We complement each others strengths very well, with formal education in art and computer programming. We have owned 38,103 on bbstudios.eth wallet since December of 2019.  The address we provided for funds deposit will be reverse resolved to artordai.eth and is the company(registered LLC) wallet.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe'll do 12 battles $1000 in art purchases and prizes each. $5K will go to final prize.\n\nI'm going on Blockchain & Booze as a dedicated guest to talk about this project in a couple weeks, and possibly out to BlockchainLA summit.  Getting brand traction and outside sponsors will pay dividends down the road, and we believe using this model will 10x daily users on battle days.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c00bf190-4046-11ed-9eb2-21be7ab68113)**",

    "title": "Limit Fund Appropriation to Grant Proposals",
    "body": "> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Limit monetary allowances to Grant proposals](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=19174de0-09bd-11ed-92a2-218eab5ea42b)\n\n## Summary\n\nRestrict appropriation of funds to established Grants Framework.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal calls for limiting fund appropriation from the Decentraland DAO to the established [Grants Framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b265e3e0-bcb0-11eb-a871-a927ffd81f49).\n\n*   This framework comprises six (6) grant tiers, ranging from $1,500 USD in MANA to $240,000 USD in stable coin, with increasing voting power thresholds for each successive grant tier. Grants over $60,000 USD (Tiers 4-6) are distributed via a six (6) month vesting contract, with a one (1) month cliff period.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nA recent proposal *[For Decentraland Daily Active Users: MANA incentives for USDC-ICE LP appropriated](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=99c66b90-e2d2-11ec-9000-175d8dd584b8)* $1mm USD in MANA from the Decentraland DAO. The funds were appropriated through a Binding Governance Proposal, as the needs of the request could not be met under the parameters of the existing Grants Framework. This is neither explicitly permitted nor prohibited under current DAO rules.\n\nThis proposal catalyzed discussion around two key questions:\n\n1.  Is it legitimate to appropriate funds outside of the established grants framework, for example, through binding governance proposals?\n2.  Is the established Grants Framework adequately designed to fully deploy DAO funds for all purposes of the DCL community - particularly for special projects that require more flexible distribution models. A past proposal to [Join the Blender Development Fund](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7890f630-3ceb-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5) is another example of a model that is difficult to fulfill within the established framework.\n\nThe first question could be immediately resolved with a stop-gap measure, while the second question, which will likely take more time and forethought, is discussed and workshopped further.\n\nThus, as demonstrated by support for the initial Pre-Proposal poll to [Limit monetary allowances to Grant proposals](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=19174de0-09bd-11ed-92a2-218eab5ea42b) and discussed in the [Monetary Allowance Working Group](https://discord.gg/A2kYndBNXN), there is enough community consensus to move forward with a stop-gap measure to prevent future appropriation of DAO funds for projects and initiatives outside of the established Grants Framework and specifically prohibiting the appropriation of funds through the use of Binding Governance Proposals.\n\nIn the interim period, should this proposal advance to a Binding Governance Proposal, Core Units of the DAO and DAO Community Members will address the fundamental structure of the Grants Framework, as part of a wider process to ensure and increase the robustness of our overall governance and grant-making structures.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nRestrict fund appropriations from the DAO to the established Grants Framework, specifically prohibiting the use of binding governance proposals as a means to receive DAO project or initiative funding.\n\n*   The payment or compensation of “Committee” positions are excluded from this restriction, including but not limited to the “DAO Committee” and “Wearables Curation Committee.”\n\nOutside of appropriating funds for compensating duties that are fundamental to the operation of the DAO on these core committees, the Grants Framework is the only mechanism for requesting and receiving DAO funding.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSince our DAO’s inception we have increasingly adapted to changing circumstances, and we will need to continue doing so in order to develop a governance system that is agile yet robust and can withstand the test of time. This proposal is a stop-gap measure to close a potential loophole in our governance and grant-making process as long term solutions are workshoped and implemented. Ongoing structural discussions include:\n\n*   Expanding the Grants Framework to include a dynamic granting tier that accounts for special requests exceeding existing tiered funding and timeline.\n*   Addressing issues with VP distribution and utilization to balance power between “whale” and “regular” community members.\n*   Increasing diversity and long-term sustainability of the Decentraland treasury.\n\n**VOTING OPTIONS**\n\n*   Yes: Restrict appropriation of funds to established Grants Framework, prohibiting use of Binding Governance Proposals\n*   No: Do not make any changes to the status quo, leaving room for funds to be appropriated through Binding Governance Proposals\n\n*This proposal was prepared by the Decentraland DAO Facilitation Team as part of its engagement with the Monetary Allowance Working Group*\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=dca499e0-3f03-11ed-9eb2-21be7ab68113)**",

    "body": "> by 0xc24789c6f165329290ddd3fbeac3b6842a294003\n\nShould the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nI am seeking funding for further development of the community card game module. This module currently provides all functions required for users to create their own card games in Decentraland. The module also comes pre-packed with two playable card games (Patience and FreeCell Solitaire). [Check it out here!](https://decentraland-solitaire.herokuapp.com/?realm=v1%7Edecentraland-solitaire.herokuapp.com\\&position=-1%2C-1)\n\nThe proposed additions are 4 new card games, with the purpose to provide more content to users and put the module’s current interfaces to the test.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003\n\n## Email address\n\nthecryptotrader69@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nCard games have been, and still are, a massively popular type of game. While there are a few places in Decentraland where users can participate in card games, there are very few resources for the community to use when developing or deploying their own card games. By providing better access to modules for developing entertainment content we could further cement Decentraland as one of the best places to participate in metaverse gaming.\n\nCurrently the community card game module provides all the utilities required to manage collections of cards (hands, decks, stacks, and slides) and create 3D card games within Decentraland. The main system creates game tables that can host several different types of card games and an effort has been made to optimise the code to reduce the strain on scene resources. The module also features two fully incorporated card games (Patience and FreeCell Solitaire), showcasing its current functionality.\n\nBy expanding the community card game module and adding additional card games we can further test the limitation of the current set of utilities, as well as providing more content for the platform. With the development of card games that have more unique rulesets we can also ensure that the module has robust functionality before making it multiplayer (It will save a lot of time finding underdeveloped areas before we begin adding netcode). It will also provide a great opportunity to monitor and detect in-scene resource limitations, making it necessary to further optimise the function.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following card games will be added to the community card game module:\n\nSpider Solitaire, Pyramid Solitaire, Accordion, Tri Peaks Solitaire\n\nThese card games have been targeted due to their varied rule-sets, which will likely require the development of additional features into the module.\n\nAll coding resources and source code will remain available to the community through the current github repository.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI'll be working on this project solo. I've been programming for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). Over the past year I’ve been developing open-source projects through the DCL SDK with the primary goal of creating baseline content and examples for the community so we can pro. I have a firm understanding of the development pipe-line and I have already completed several projects on the platform.\n\nYou can also play some of my previous projects here:\n\n[Minesweeper](https://decentraland-minesweeper.herokuapp.com/)\n\n[Checkers](https://decentraland-checkers-showcase.vercel.app/?position=0%2C0)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis project will be completed within 2 weeks of this proposal's acceptance. The basic roadmap is as follows:\n\n    Week 1: Implementation of additional card games\n    Week 2: Scene/code polish, implementation of suggested features within scope\n\nAs with any project, there will likely be bugs/flaws in implementation. I'll be maintaining the main repository and will work towards fixing these as they get flagged.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0db018f0-3e25-11ed-ae53-272ba72c798d)**",

Decentraland has many casinos and other establishments that require financial investments from players. Therefore, for an ordinary user, Decentraland looks like a place where everyone wants to get money from them - but it is and can be much more than that!\n\n### Previous proposal\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=12f794f0-167a-11ed-affb-95d45c2147f8\n\n### TL;DR changes in the resubmission\n\nThe updated budget focuses on creating a demo version to demonstrate the gameplay\n\n### Examples of game assets\n\nWe believe that the main thing missing in Decentraland is the reasons for an ordinary user rather than an investor to join it. The purpose of our game is to become such a reason and thereby attract a lot of new users to Decentraland.\n\nDungeons and Dragons inspired the game we want to create. But it won’t be a copy of it. We decided to simplify some game mechanics so that it fits better into Decentraland and is easy to understand for all users regardless of roleplay experience.\n\n### Scope\n\nThe scope of this grant proposal is ~ 2 months. We want to release a demo version of our game during this period.\n\n### Duration\n\nThe demo's duration will be short (~ 10 minutes) but intense.

The proposed scope extends Byldr’s functionality by a) adding interactivity/logic for scene exports; b) download scene source code; c) Byldr desktop client; and d) reliability improvements.\n\n[Video | Byldr showcased at Decentraland DAO meeting](shorturl.at/acFI9)\n\n[Video | Full overview](https://youtu.be/jt6UhF9r73c)\n\nWe are honored and excited to bring more capabilities to Decentraland for a fully realized metaverse experience and increased economic opportunities for creators.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x7A5eF3b7d27Eec9B92c491283F65D85c73421f9f\n\n## Email address\n\nsean@byldr.app\n\n## Description\n\n### Background\n\nIn December 2021, the community voted to approve a [Decentraland DAO grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=088fc210-5e26-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) that launched one of the first significant VR efforts to the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nWith the previous DAO grant, the development team was able to enhance Byldr to support exporting creations to Decentraland parcels. For the first time, Decentraland creators could use VR to build fully functioning, interactive scenes for parcels without any code or any knowledge of the Decentraland SDK. This vastly lowered the barrier for Decentraland content creation and provided an increase in opportunities for creators without any technical or programming experience. The team exceeded the grant’s proposed deliverables by also implementing a state-of-the art code converter that allowed users to use Byldr’s no-code logic blocks to create interactive scenes for Decentraland, by automatically converting Byldr’s JSON-based logic to Decentraland’s TypeScript-based logic. [See a showcase video here presented during a DAO town hall meeting.](shorturl.at/acFI9)\n\n### Proposed Grant\n\nSince introducing the Decentraland export feature to Byldr, the Byldr team has received positive feedback as well as requests for further expand upon Byldr’s Decentraland support.\n\nThe development team seeks to build upon the previous achievements by submitting the current grant proposal. The proposed expansions to Byldr covered by this grant proposal includes:\n\n*   Additional no-code logic blocks for greater flexibility in interactive scene creation\n*   Expanding the creator tool beyond VR so that it also supports 2D platforms (desktop computer) to embrace a broader user base and further democratize development\n*   Increasing robustness of Byldr’s Decentraland support to   accommodate future SDK changes.\n*   The ability to download the Decentraland scene source code for any Decentraland scenes created using Byldr, to provide creators with additional flexibility and ownership over their parcel’s content.\n\nAdditional details for proposed enhancements are provided in the Specification section of this grant proposal.\n\nThe Byldr development team is excited for the opportunity work with DAO and the Decentraland community to expand upon our trusted immersive creation experience for Decentraland and would like to thank everyone in the Decentraland community for your support and the integral part you play in building the XR and metaverse future for all generations to come.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe development team seeks to build upon its previous achievements by submitting the current grant proposal. The proposed enhancements to Byldr covered by this grant proposal include:\n\n*   **Additional no-code logic blocks for greater flexibility in interactive scene creation.** This includes adding support for action-trigger pairs such as collision triggers, ability to select a keystroke or specific VR button as a trigger, and increased Decentraland support for existing Byldr features such as physics, parenting, solvers, and more.\n*   **Expanding the creator tool beyond VR so that it also supports 2D platforms (desktop computer) in order to have a larger impact and availability.** A common feedback received is that while creating in an immersive environment is efficient and exciting, the lack of a 2D/desktop client for Byldr limits the adoption of the platform to only those with VR hardware. The Byldr team seeks to further lower barriers for creators by porting our experience to run on computers instead of only VR headsets.\n*   **Increasing robustness of Byldr’s Decentraland support to accommodate future SDK changes.** Currently whenever there is a significant Decentraland SDK update, the development team is required to manually update Byldr’s Decentraland logic convertor and scene exporter – or risk our Decentraland export service not working. To increase reliability, efficiency and decrease the requirement for manual updates, the Byldr team will implement automated backend SDK updates to prevent any breaking changes caused by Decentraland SDK updates from negatively affecting our export service.\n*   **The ability to download the Decentraland scene source code for any Decentraland scenes created using Byldr, to provide creators with additional flexibility and ownership over their parcel’s content.** Another common request is for the ability of creators to download the TypeScript and full source code of their Decentraland parcels from Byldr. This will empower creators to further tweak the TypeScript code or make any further customizations outside of Byldr and publish to Decentraland directly.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe items outlined in this grant proposal will be managed and completed by the Byldr team and our associated partners.\n\nThe team comprises:\n\n*   Sean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n*   Stephen Clarke (Management)\n*   Ketan Kapila (3D modeling/tooling)\n*   Varun Siddaraju (Technical project manager and senior developer)\n*   Clint Campbell (XR developer)\n*   Paul Gumpert (XR developer)\n*   Clinton Reddie (XR developer)\n*   [VeeRuby Technologies](https://www.veeruby.com/) (Byldr's development partner)\n*   [AppVolks LLC](https://www.appvolks.com/) (Byldr's development partner)\n*   [XR Dev Studio](https://www.xrdevstudio.com/) (Byldr's development partner)\n\nCollectively, Byldr's team members have over 100 person-years of XR development experience. Additional information on our company, team members, and partners can be found in the links below:\n\n*   https://www.byldr.app/\n*   https://www.veeruby.com/\n*   https://www.appvolks.com/\n*   https://www.xrdevstudio.com/\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe team will report progress to the Decentraland community on an ongoing basis and will monitor the project's forum closely for questions or to provide updates as needed. The team will summarize major activities formally in a monthly report.\n\nThe proposed project will be completed within 6 months based on the following milestones and timeline:\n\n*   **November-December 2022:** Expand support for wider variety of logic block for Decentraland export. Progress toward Byldr desktop client support. Progress towards automated Decentraland SDK backend updates.\n*   **January-February 2023:** Continued work on Byldr desktop client support. Continued work on SDK backend updates. Community testing of early set of expanded logic blocks for Decentraland export. Progress towards ability to download Decentraland scene source code.\n*   **March-April 2023:** Continued beta tests expected. Testing, bug fixes, user feedback collection. Full release of desktop client, expanded logic support, ability to download scene source code. Completion of SDK automated updates.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c9aa8040-3c09-11ed-a2ad-25cde07289d9)**",

    "body": "> by 0xce828b10570351a8d56d934cc2481950ddfa12df (WisherVodka#12df)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nBringing the hype back to Decentraland. Doing things that don't scale has been a bit of a tagline for Wisher in DCL. However, during our launch phase we discovered just how impactful our Street Team was to the global DCL community and forging connections that have turned into some of the biggest communities within DCL. Around this time last year we began hanging around the fountain welcoming people into DCL and discovered the world's first web 3 click funnel. This click funnel basically outlined our launch strategy of driving traffic from outside DCL into DCL and then picking up contact with them and diving them to a call to action of some kind.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n30,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xCE828b10570351a8d56d934CC2481950DDFA12DF\n\n## Email address\n\nalex@ahawc.com\n\n## Description\n\nSee more info here:\nhttps://wisherdao.my.canva.site/\n\nProblem this solves:\n\nWe need to bring more users into DCL and get them up to speed and create some stickiness with friendship and community. By operationalizing the Street Team, we can enable an always on funnel of new people joining our community and finding ways to tap into it in their own unique ways.\n\nWe will follow the traditional Inspire, Engage, Commit marking model that many organizations use to drive conversion. (more details outlined in our website link here:\n\nhttps://wisherdao.my.canva.site/\n\nWe will use this proposal to stand up the POC for this pipeline by employing individuals to work within DCL as community engagers as well as other web 2 platofrms to create a closed loop funnel towards filling up events again.\n\nThe Street team will promote Wisher Vodka's events, but since we were born in the community, and ultimately call DCL home. We will take new users around to other community pillars to introduce them to all DCL has to offer. On nights we host events we will drive traffic to our events, but since this street team is working 40 hour weeks, they will drive to other events throughout the week as well so we all benefit.\n\nWisher Vodka will use the funds to pay for these new street team members time as well as some small amount reserved for resource planning and workers comp insurance etc.\n\nThis 30k proposal is set to demonstrate the value of the POC to the community and bring new people into the ecosystem. This should give us 2-3 months burn rate to identify new conversion strategies and track necessary KPI's.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOnce this proposal has passed we will immediately open job applications for the following roles:\n\nStreet team leader\nStream Team member(s)\nSocial media street team wrangler(s)\n\nOnce these roles have ben filled we will negotiate hourly rates and set up cadences of people manning the fountain and other social media outlets. Previous team members are welcome to apply.\n\nOutside this proposal Wisher plans to continue our weekly artist in residence concert with  DJ TRAX as well as add additional events back into the schedule as we had down previously to add free value to the community and test new strategies towards paths to purchase.\n\nOur core KPI metric is user dwell time at events and conversions through our online store, if these metrics improve during this POC we will consider it a success. We will be testing and learning the most ideal call to actions for purchase behavior within DCL to make way for more brands to come in by improving the path to purchase for digital goods as well as IRL goods.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nBokkeh will be the hiring manager for the open roles and will be supported by Klow, Emstastic, and Kbw.\n\nBokkeh has previous experience running teams at fortune 500 brands and is the CTO of Wisher.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nAfter the proposal passes we will enact the following steps in order:\n\n1.  Set up job applications via wishervodka.com\n2.  Hold interviews of qualified candidates\n3.  Execute hiring paperwork\n4.  Establish regular working hours for street team to operate based on time availability. We will attempt to align with big events nights in DCL to drive traffic to events.\n5.  Host a \"Meet the street team\" twitter spaces & stream where everyone can meet them and share what they are working on so they can be knowledgeable about what's going on in DCL and they can help support the overall community outside of Wisher's agenda.\n6.  They will attend the bigger townhall discussions to stay up to speed on the community discussions.\n7.  Execute the work.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b328a6d0-3b7d-11ed-a2ad-25cde07289d9)**",

    "body": "> by 0x9dfa9dfd15d2b2fa9717b4fc545c2bb35a29215c\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWakeUp Labs' objective is to lower barriers to accessing the web3 ecosystem, especially working in the NFT and metaverse space, helping both projects and end users.\nWe're developing on-chain seamless NFT delegation solutions where NFTs never leave the owner's wallet.\nWe're also partnering with NFT protocols so they can integrate our Delegation solution, an on-chain native delegation mechanism.\nNFT owners can delegate or lend NFTs for a specific period to another account without risking losing the token, as it will never leave the wallet. New features are fully backwards compatible with existing standards fostering composability & interoperability.\nWe request this grant to cover the development of adding Decentraland's Lands to our platform.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x74B5ac5D6d03d3C10B823a955A1B3E127DE5aEE5\n\n## Email address\n\nhello@wakeuplabs.io\n\n## Description\n\nWakeUp has developed a protocol for NFT delegation.\n\nYou can play with the MVP here: https://p2p-rental-front-7i2b8rr2i-wakeupdao.vercel.app/\n\nAnd here's our NFT Delegation Protocol One-Pager: https://www.wakeuplabs.io/one-pager\n\nDecentraland is the biggest and most decentralized metaverse today with a huge community behind.\n\nWe want to add value, allowing LAND owners the possibility to earn a new revenue stream by renting their land while lowering the barrier for new people who want to interact, try and use a Decentraland Land Plot.\n\n\\[What does “NFT Delegation” mean? Precisely that: people will be able to assign temporary rights for their NFTs to be used by other people who do not own the NFT.]\n\nInteresting is that not only delegations but also rentals will be allowed. A Small Fee will be distributed to the Decentraland DAO in the rental process.\n\nSo, every paid rent will become a new revenue for the entire DAO.\n\nThe % will be between 0.1-5% of the total amount paid to the renter.\n\n—---------\n\nWhy does native on-chain delegation matter?\nDecentraland’s roots are decentralized and fully on-chain.\nIn a decentralized, open and programmable database, such as a blockchain, it is essential to know if the one who interacts is the owner of the NFT or the User.\nOn-Chain delegation is like sharing; there is someone who owns the NFT, but they can share it with a friend or coworker, among others; thus reducing the barriers for new users.\nFinally, you can delegate an NFT through the back-end, but WakeUp Labs also provides a front-end to help users to delegate and rent more simply.\n\nThe Issue for Decentraland LAND holders:\nWith the boom and the hype of last year in Decentraland, lands were auctioned, and now if someone wants to join Decentraland by owning land, it isn't very easy.\nAlso, the virtual world is only as valuable as the experiences and content that may exist there. And with many lands for speculation, the possibilities of having new content and experiences in the metaverse are reduced.\nWe know that many lands are without any use; this causes the land supply to shrink and reduces the chance of more builders. What happens if someone holds more than one land plot but wants only to use one? What can they do with the rest of the plots?\nIf landowners want to keep lands simply because they're interested in the project or perhaps because they haven't yet assigned them a specific use, they wouldn't be generating new income or new users.\n\nWake Up solution:\nAllow Rent and On-Chain Delegation to Decentraland Lands through a simple interface.\nOnce the NFT has been delegated, the now \"delegate\" will be able to access all its benefits (for instance, holding an event or an art exhibition) but will not have the right to transfer it. The NFT will always be in the owner's wallet.\nLenders cannot only list a Decentraland land in a rental marketplace but also generate a magical link for a particular renter. Also, they can delegate it to a friend for free.\n\nThis NFT delegation mechanism will open a whole new world of opportunities/functionalities for NFT projects and holders.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThere are some important features to mention:\n\n\\-The NFT never leaves the owner's wallet, → reduces the risk of losing an NFT.\n\n\\-The NFT owner can decide to whom they will assign the delegation.\n\n\\-It all occurs on-chain, in a trustless and decentralized way (no need for extra intermediaries nor centralized systems)\n\n\\-A fee % goes to the Decentraland DAO.\n\nIt's just the beginning; this could be the first feature to implement with Decentraland. Delegable Wearables could be the next. These delegable/rentable wearables could allow owners and users to go to a special place uniquely for them\n\nTo make this happen, from WakeUp Labs, we will create the necessary smart contracts and APIs for the proper Decentraland integration to our platform and enable NFT delegation/renting for Decentraland LANDs.\n\nAfter this stage, our next move is to create a permissionless rental dapp, so Decentraland (and any other project) can easily add these new revenue streams (earning royalties fees every time an NFT is rented).\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nFounders Team:\nMilton Berman is an Informatics Engineer graduate.

This will allow us to test the smart contracts' behaviour on land delegations' core functionalities: trustless LAND lending and renting.\n\nStage 2 - Dapp integrated to a smart contract on testnet (Week 2)\nIntegrate our dApp to WakeUp's Rental smart contracts already running on testnet at this point. We will be able to test the LAND delegation/renting/lending features from an end-user perspective. Then we will be ready to deploy on Mainnet Ethereum.\n\nStage 3 - Final delivery in mainnet (Week 3)\nWith the smart contracts and dDapp running smoothly on the Ethereum testnet, we will be ready to deploy everything in the Mainnet Ethereum for any user to start lending and renting Decentraland’s LANDs.\n\nPossible future steps:\n1-Allow current and old wearables delegation and renting.\\\n2-Replace the 721 for 4907 standard in Wearable.\n3-Allow native renting mechanisms on the DCL marketplace.\n\nWe believe that Decentraland is and will continue to be the spearhead in the NFT and Metaverse space, so adding extra features to NFTs like lending/renting or delegating them will enrich the community and allow more users.\n\nKnow more about WakeUp Labs here: https://linktr.ee/wakeuplabs\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=68a96ab0-3900-11ed-a2f4-07fa9844a05e)**",

    "body": "> by 0x86edb92e217605dbecf606548e48daaf1b817da1 (MetaTrekkers)\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nBudget Breakdown - https://bit.ly/mtpresent\n\nOne way to ensure the progressive success of Decentraland is by developing multi-disciplinary, cross-world projects like the MetaTrekkers entertainment platform for art and artists alike. From the beginning, MetaTrekkers’ mission has been to become an immersive platform that allows artists to tap into the endless opportunities brought by the metaverse. MetaTrekkers has been developing weekly events like festivals and special concerts headlined by important names in both the metaverse and the real-world entertainment scene. Through Decentraland DAO’s support, MetatTrekkers aims to become an artist-supporting and arts-expression platform, ensuring a steady flow of new users for the environment.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x50a83425d537e39a0b7f884dCC07e6f4F37A09F3\n\n## Email address\n\nhello@metatrekkers.io\n\n## Description\n\nSince there are character limitations in the grant request form, you can read the full description and details of the proposal here: https://bit.ly/metatrekkersfullcopy\n\nMetaTrekkers has been developing, organizing and hosting innovative events in Decentraland for over a year and, whether it’s concerts or art shows, we have learned that the foundation for a thriving environment is a tight-knit community with access to a range of features that allow it to benefit from the interaction and engagement inside the metaverse. Knowing this, MetaTrekkers wants to become the platform that brings the artist and metaverse-user communities together and rewards them for their participation in various series of entertainment events, sessions and talks.\nThe grant would cover the development, marketing and advertising of the events and innovative features aimed at improving the Decentraland user experience.\nBy expanding the brand awareness of Decentraland as a user engagement-focused metaverse, we are reaching out to new users interested in onboarding and attracting a new, important target – brands looking to adopt new “customer journey” technologies and solutions.\nTurning art and entertainment series like the MetaTrekkers x Venice Music Concerts or the BeatTrekkers DJ Battles into Decentraland resident events, we are ensuring a constant flow of metaverse newcomers originating from the artists’ fanbase. As a fresh experience for a new user, we want to offer a full range of engaging performances and means for them to showcase their art, all while being rewarded for their activity with metaverse-specific benefits provided by a large network of partner locations and projects spread all over Decentraland.\nEstablishing MetaTrekkers as an artist and entertainment platform, which constantly develops new concepts based on community involvement, will provide a ramp for Decentraland to multiply its reach and an incentive for artists and fans alike to discover the endless possibilities featured in a socially active, virtual environment. The possibility for the Decentraland DAO and the platform to become a hub for visionary artists who want to explore the virtual environment and experiment together with their following, relies on investing in the proper partnership and communication opportunities, like the MetaTrekkers x Venice Music collaboration and the development of a Decentraland onboarding standard, which will be made available to all Decentraland venues through an open-source kit.\nThe funds from the DAO grant will serve to build the platform as a self-sustainable project that represents a portal for artists and fans across the planet, and from other metaverses, to access Decentraland and make it the go-to virtual world for entertainment and arts.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo paint a clear picture of the importance held by the MetaTrekkers events regarding onboarding new users into Decentraland and building an organic community, we must start from the beginning of our metaverse entertainment journey.\n\nDubfest\nOur first step into the (big) live events territory was when the MetaTrekkers Clubhouse hosted the 24 hour / 24 artists Dub Fest, the first event of its kind in the metaverse, which brought over 300 visitors to the Decentraland location, out of which we succeeded to convert into Decentraland regular users around 80%.\n\nVenice Music\nThe MetaTrekkers entertainment journey continued with a partnership that emphasizes the overall importance our initiative holds in regard to making the Decentraland metaverse known and accessible to new target audiences. We are talking about the MetaTrekkers x Venice Music series of concerts. It is worth mentioning that this music label was founded by Troy Carter, former manager for artists like Eve, John Legend and Lady Gaga, and one of the biggest names in the entertainment industry to direct their business towards web3, through an NFT-gated, professional collective.\n\nThe first concert of the series also brought a strategic collaboration for MetaTrekkers – teaming up with Decentral Games in order to offer the best onboarding experience for all the fans who wanted to attend their favorite artist’s concert but were new to the metaverse. To put it into numbers, the first MetaTrekkers x Venice Music concert has given us the opportunity to reach a new audience of 2.5 million social media accounts (all four artists’ following combined).\n\nYossy Concert\nThe next milestone of our Decentraland entertainment adventure was an important event for the Latinx NFT music scene, and it was marked by a special concert featuring Yossy, a Latinx musician and first-time metaverse performer. This event has allowed us to reach a new, niche audience of over 12k followers, of which some became Decentraland users after receiving their metaverse onboarding.\n\nBeatTrekkers\nCurrently the biggest DJ battle series of events in the metaverse, BeatTrekkers is MetaTrekkers’ biggest initiative to date as it engages twelve competing artists, guest artists, the Decentraland and MetaTrekkers community, plus new audiences – the participating artists’ metaverse-newbie fans and general public interested in the benefits associated with NFT music and being part of a developing metaverse community.\n\nSince our aim is to give back to the community as much we can, one of the main rewarding ideas within BeatTrekkers is to give fans and supporters access to the artists’ work, well beyond the live performances, in the form of wearables, NFTs and private lessons led by the artists themselves. The BeatTrekkers series has the potential to become a platform for Decentraland to onboard big names in the music industry.\n\nIn order to make this happen, we are requesting a grant of $120,000 USD. This funding will be used to cover the costs of marketing, event production and artist fees. We believe that this grant will pay off in the form of increased awareness and adoption of Decentraland, as well as providing a fun and immersive experience for art and music fans.

However, with the lack of proper tools to efficiently deploy and monitor its virtual goods, companies may not fully invest in its metaverse sales initiatives.\n\nTo solve this, we are motivated to develop the tools required for scene owners in Decentraland to efficiently sell their digital objects on their scene.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x9243C7F89737775413b55DcB3D9237Cb20618a3b\n\n## Email address\n\n0xgabe23@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nWe are going to develop a npm package for Decentraland that will allow any scene owner to implement their own “on-parcel store” to manage the purchase and sale of any wearable, in a streamlined, efficient way.\nThe objectives for the project are:\nEach owner should be able to have their own shop displaying the items they choose to sell, on their own scene.\nSeparate the role of a developer from a community manager/ event planner by allowing the community manager to easily manage the published items to the shop from a user-friendly website, without needing to modify the scene code.\n\nThe process is the following:\n\nA developer implements this new package on a scene\nWithin the scene code, ‘’slots’’ are created, which are spaces where the wearables will be located, specifying the x,y,z coordinates of these slots.\nFrom the external website, the community manager will have the chance to indicate which wearable they would want to place for sale on each of the slots\nThe external website will automatically generate a json file with all of the necessary configuration for that shop. The scene will interface accordingly to the set configuration\nThe users are now allowed to access the scene to purchase the objects (i.e. wearables) placed for sale.\n\nAdditionally we will add a functionality to allow the user to publish their wearables to the marketplace from a 2D module window but still from within the metaverse.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe platform will rely on its own backend, developed over node js. This backend will manage the information of each scene shop and marketplace.\nThe package that will be implemented on each Decentraland scene will be developed using Typescript.\nThere will be a websocket connection between the backend and each scene that implements the package for pushing marketplace updates.\nThe transactions towards the marketplace will implement meta-transactions for a seamless experience (and free gas transaction for the user) .\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe team will be formed by four senior developers:\n0xGabe (PMO)\nNull  (Front end)\nTallulah-Arg (Back end)\nNgioffre (Front - Back)\n\nThe team has expertise on the following areas:\nVainilla js, Vue.js, React.js, React native, Ionic, Cordova , Node.js , Nest.js, Php, Bash scripting , Sql and no-sql databases., Infraestructura, AWS services , Gcp services, Github actions, Jenkins CI CD, NX monorepo, Pulumi for CI/CD, Web3, ethers js, Solidity, Hardhat and many more.\n\nOur development team was responsible for the following milestones in Decentraland:\nDiscord chat integration inside Decentraland\nTwitch chat integration inside Decentraland\nTheta streaming services integration inside Decentraland\nDevelopment of vip areas/restricted areas based on the possession of an NFT\nDevelopment of the Amnesia scene\nDevelopment of a CMS for Decentraland scenes.\n\nThe latest development, the CMS for scenes, is a solution which offers the possibility to manage banners and variables of a DCL  scene from an external website.\n\nThis is how the dashboard looks like:\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/gkfJSZNg/dashboard.jpg\n\nThe user is able to modify banners or variables from within a dashboard, and the changes are reflected on a json file, which is obtained through an endpoint.\nThe Decentraland scene uses that endpoint and reacts accordingly to the configuration (i.e., specifying the media an advertising banner should display).\nThis tool allows for a  CM to make changes on a scene without the help from a developer.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nIf the grant proposal is passed, a completed & tested package would be available at the beginning of Q1 2023.\n2D Interface for wearables (sell and purchase) inside the metaverse.\nAvatarShape integration.\nReal-time Web3 confirmation to the marketplace.\nPlug and Play SDK for node.js (Decentraland), full typed.\nImprove test code-coverage.\nDesign metaverse UI\nAutomatically create slots within the account setup.\nReady to use dispenser functionality.\nWeb3 backend integration using an external provider.\nSales reporting\nCentralized backend implementation\nBuild database schema with migrations\nDeployment and go-live\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=67885a20-34a9-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8)**",

    "body": "> by 0xd5e9ef1cedad0d135d543d286a2c190b16cbb89e (DougNFTWorld)\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to secure funding that will allow us to further the development of NFT World City. This includes the completion of racing and chess games that have already been started, as well as the addition of a comedy club venue and escape room. We encourage you to visit the city if you are not already familiar with it: https://play.decentraland.org/?position=150,63\\&realm=athena\n\nAs NFT World projects have all been self funded up to this point, the company is reaching a limit on what we are able to produce. So today we're turning to the community to ask for funds that will help us capitalize on the momentum that we've created from all that has been built so far in order to reach the true potential of this city concept.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x79fF1B31D61c73f993e0743897eA4B51E53C4e1b\n\n## Email address\n\ndoug@nftworld.io\n\n## Description\n\nNFT World City is hosted in Aetheria District at 150,65 - a huge 11x11 (121 parcels) two-level city that is the single largest scene hosted in Decentraland to date. The city was designed to serve as a spot where visitors are incentived to attend events in order to generate traffic. Sponsors pay to host events, attendees earn a reward for attending them which generates traffic, and this traffic then draws interest from other brands looking for exposure. Brands can also establish a more permanent residence by leasing space within the city. Spaces include art galleries, NFT storefronts, brand headquarters, games, and more.\n\nWith this grant, we are proposing:\n\n1.  Completion of a racing game where players race each other around a track. We have already built a track that runs around the perimeter of the Chicago area in the city, and we already have the ability to change avatars into Battle Racers vehicles. Next steps that this grant will help us achieve is turning all of this into a game with free/paid races, prize distribution, leaderboard, additional vehicle choices, and choice of environment. Vehicle choices will include DCL skins as well as integration of external NFT projects (such as we have already done with the TKING Bugatti). Environment choices could include ideas like UFO crash site, apocalypse, or seasonal decor.\n\n2.  Turning the Mehak Jain Gallery chessboard collaboration into a playable game. Users will have the choice to play for free, or to compete for prizes in exchange for a gameplay fee. A leaderboard will keep track of player's win/loss ratio. Players enjoy a more immersive Alice in Wonderland kind of experience from controlling their pieces from inside the game rather than looking top down at the board.\n\n3.  Comedy club venue which will host playlists of pre-recorded sets as well as live-streamed shows. We are hosting playlist content already for our partners at Comedy Hub, but it is located in the stadium alongside music playlists. The grant money will go toward a dedicated space for comedy shared by multiple partners - bringing the best all in one place. Content will be updated regularly so that audiences have fresh selection to choose from in order to encourage repeat visits. The club will be decorated with humorous atmosphere and a classy vibe that is friendly for all ages. Comedy sets will be clearly marked and categorized by level of vulgarity/maturity so that users can filter for the type of comedy that suits their personal preference.\n\n4.  Escape room where players must work together to solve a mystery in order to find their way out of a precarious situation. The theme of this build will be a Cursed Egyptian Tomb. But it'll be built in such a way that we will be able to replicate important parts of it for other themes as well in the future. Abandoned Spaceship Mission? Murder Mystery Mansion? Jungle Temple? The possibilities are endless.\n\nEach of these will be built on 2x2 estates already available within the city.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nRacing game - 2x2 multilevel racetrack. Up to 4 racers per track. Racers choose between different environments to race around. The track remains the same for each environment. Users can also choose their vehicle. There will be 5-10 Battle Racers vehicles to choose from by default. We will also integrate DCL avatar skins to increase vehicle selection even further which can include animals, mythical creatures, planes, spaceships, or anything else that the community comes up with. Vehicle speed will remain the same regardless of the type. A leaderboard will record fastest race times. All races must finish by a certain time (5 minutes?). Users cannot go backward, only forward, in order to prevent shortcuts to the finish line. Falling off the track results in starting at the beginning again. Racers will need to balance risk of falling off while going too fast, versus going slow and staying on the track but then risk getting passed up by other racers. Gameplays will be free and paid. Winners of free gameplays receive no prize. Winners of paid gameplays receive a large share of the gameplay fees, and second place earns their gameplay fee back.\n\nChess game - 2x2 chessboard. Players control their pieces from inside the game. Hovering over a piece highlights the squares that the piece is able to be moved to, and then the destination square becomes clickable. Upon choosing the destination square, the piece then follows a path to it. If an enemy piece is already present on the same square, it is removed from the game. Captured enemy pieces from each team are tracked in the UI. Players may compete for free, or pay a gameplay fee. Winners of paid games will receive their gameplay fee back as well as a portion of the other player’s gameplay fee. Top ranked players will be shown on a leaderboard.\n\nComedy club - 2x2 venue. A shared club for multiple comedians and comedy groups. Each will have their own playlist for videos that will be shown on a screen (similar to the music playlists in the stadium). The club will have dedicated space for different comedic content. For example, family-friendly content will be separate from adult content. We will live stream sets as well to bring audiences together in a more social format for enjoying comedy. Amateur nights will give lesser known comedians some spotlight. Comedians that contribute content will be allowed to advertise their upcoming events and link out to their social media accounts.\n\nEscape room - 2x2 environment. A collaborative experience where players work together to solve a mystery in order to escape the scene alive within a certain timeframe (30 minutes?). An archaeologist has gone missing and the team needs to figure out what happened, and then escape before suffering the same ill fate. A journal is found with some clues. It contains deciphered hieroglyphics with captions like “curse”, “sickness”, “death” which look similar to some of those inscribed on the tomb walls. Some of the pages also contain rough sketches of artifacts and a partial map. A raspy voice on a recording seem to indicate some instructions on what to do with these materials. There will be a gameplay fee but no rewards for successful escapes. Parts of the game may be randomized in order to curb cheating, but unlike a P2E game, the goal for this one is to create a fun experience that encourages players to bring back more family/friends to share it with regardless of the outcome of their game.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nDoug (Doug | NFTWorld.io#0519 on Discord) has been an OG contributor within Decentraland since the beginning. In 2019 he founded NFT World (https://nftworld.io/) to promote brands in the Metaverse. Since then, Doug and team have created various DCL scenes that now comprise NFT World City and have also built:\n\nMetaverse Chat (https://metaversechat.io/) - Incorporates Decentraland avatar profiles into a blockchain-based chat app.\nMetaverse Browser Extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metaverse/nghkdhckeabmkjbklgocfoojnpchhlgc) - Makes it easier to navigate resources for Decentraland and other virtual worlds in the Metaverse.\nMetaverse Coin (https://mtvrs.com/) - Handed out at NFT World City events to incentive attendance.\nMTVRS Market (https://market.mtvrs.com/) - Offers utility for Metaverse Coin by allowing holders to exchange the coin for NFT World avatar wearables which can then be sold for other currency on the Decentraland Marketplace or OpenSea.\n\nThe team consists of freelancers sourced from platforms like Upwork as well as some of the best known experts from within the Decentraland community. We have talent that covers all of the required key skill areas for building within Decentraland - developers, 3D modelers, graphic designers, etc. Which specific individuals will assist with each project associated with this proposal will be determined once it passes, but the core team will include trusted partners that we have already worked with in the past.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe order of priority is:\n\n1.  Racing game (1 month)\n2.  Chess game (1 month)\n3.  Comedy Club (1 month)\n4.  Escape room (3 months)\n\nThe racing game will be top priority out of the gate. Since we already have a head start on it, as well as the chess game, the team may at times work on different projects simultaneously in order to avoid bottlenecks. For example, 3D modelers might begin building out the comedy club venue and escape room environment while devs code the nuts and bolts of the racing and chess games that already have some of the visual foundation built. We will converge when possible in order to focus all efforts on completing one deliverable from the list at a time in a top-down manner.\n\nIn terms of ETA's, we will deliver all projects within a 6 month timeframe. We expect the escape room to take the longest since it is the most complex build, and will be built from scratch, so we estimate 3 months for it. The racing and chess games have a head start so we estimate 1 month each for those, as well as for the comedy club which hasn't been started yet but isn't as complex of a build.\n\nThe NFT World team has a proven reputation within the space and the community. We appreciate your consideration and hope that you'll support us in embarking on this next leg of our journey. Thank you!\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=479bbd40-346a-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8)**",

    "body": "> by 0x3cf368faecdb4a4e542c0efd17850ae133688c2a (DappCraft)\n\nShould PROJECT NAYOM1 be added to the Linked Wearables Registry?\n\n## NFT Marketplace Listing\n\n- https://nayom1.another-1.io/\n\n\n## Relevant Links\n\n- https://nayom1.another-1.io/\n\n\n## NFT Collections Description\n\nThe Project NAYOM1 NFT collection is a collaborative PHYGITAL project jointly introduced by Another-1 and the Italian luxury brand Casadei.\n\nAccording to Casadei’s confidentiality arrangement, the project will not be publicly released before 22 September 2022, which is the opening day of the Milan fashion week.\n\nOwners of the NFTs will have the PFP, linked wearable and also a pair of real-world Casadei 10-year anniversary limited edition high heels.\n\nThe protagonist of the NFT collection is NAYOM1, a female character featuring cyberpunk look & feel. The collection contains 1,000 assets of the avatar with different combinations of multiple traits (lips/eye/accessory/cloth/hair colors, background).\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nBy bringing the NFT collection to DCL, our goal is to make Project NAYOM1 a strong case for digitalization of traditional luxury brands and help educate traditional retail consumers about the value of Web3.\n\nIn collaboration with DAPPCRAFT we decided to create 1:1 representations of our PFP collection in Decentraland. Each wearable/skin will feature all the traits from the NFT asset. In this way, owners of the NFT can also showcase their beloved character in Decentraland. And we believe the project can make significant contribution to DCL’s ecosystem by introducing real-world brand & consumer group engagement.\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n1000\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\n[Another-1 and Casadei are officially partnering up to introduce this project](https://twitter.com/CesareCasadei/status/1567601019827228672?s=20\\&t=PV4LqmCb9-wiZLQLkRO99Q)\n\n\n## Smart Contract Address\n\n- 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n\n\n## Manager Address\n\n- 0x3cf368FaeCdb4a4E542c0efD17850ae133688C2a\n\n\n## Is this collection generated programmatically?\n- Yes\n\n\n## Method\n\nThis collection is programmatically generated.  We use one/same mesh for all 1000 models. Only textures based on collection traits were generated.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=afcd7570-344c-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8)**",

    "title": "[Resubmission] DAO Committee Compensation",
    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[DAO Committee Compensation](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9e324210-e01d-11ec-8ad9-ab7454ba5993)\n\n## Summary\n\nEstablish a monthly compensation for DAO Committee Members, who are currently acting as a trusted proxy to enact on-chain proposals voted in the DAO.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe main responsibilities of the DAO Committee are:\n\n*   Update proposal status in the governance platform (promote to enacted, passed, rejected)\n*   Keep updated smart contract lists such as: POIs, BanNames, Catalysts and Linked Wearables.\n*   Manage the Grants Program (deploy, fund and revoke vesting contracts)\n*   Execute Treasury Operations (do transfers, swap funds).\n*   Calculate and execute compensation for the Wearables Curation Committee.\n*   Reimburse gas fees to the DAO Committee.\n*   Refill gas tank of Polygon Relayer periodically.\n\nSome other tasks related to the role are:\n\n*   Attend bi-monthly Town Halls and provide general community support.\n*   Give feedback to proposals, evaluate risks and implementations pathways.\n*   Contact external organizations in the name of the DAO.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn the past year,  [one committee member has sent +500 transactions](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xfe91C0c482E09600f2d1DBCA10FD705BC6de60bc)  in the name of the DAO. Thanks to  [the proposal of reimbursement of gas fees](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f3f19d40-17ff-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) , this operation doesn’t have a monetary loss for the committee members. **However, each of these transactions required attention to review/sign and those efforts are not being compensated in any form**.\nAdding to this situation, one of the initial three committee members resigned early this year. It has been hard to find a replacement who can take such a responsibility and willing to do it for free.\n\n**Compensate DAO Committee members is fundamental for a sustainable DAO operation.**\n\n\n## Specification\n\nEstablish a monthly payment of 2,400 USD payable in MANA each month. The amount is established in USD to avoid problems related to MANA's price volatility.\n\nEach committee member will commit to working 4hrs per week at a rate of 150 USD/hr.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nSetting compensation to the DAO Committee will attract and retain members with the required know-how to take such a responsibility. Having a strong DAO Committee will ensure the timely operations of the DAO.\n\nThis proposal specifies a fixed compensation per month regardless of the activity of the committee member. This might be a risk for a committee with many members, where the work of verifying transactions is done by a sub-set of the group. At the moment the committee only has 2 members and this is not a problem, but it would be interesting to transition to a performance-based compensation in the future (e.g. based on the number of transactions initiated and signed by the member).\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe DAO Committee already has control of the DAO Treasury and is responsible for making payments to the Curators Committee and funding Grants voted by the DAO.\n\nThe DAO Committee will issue the compensation to itself at the beginning of every month by sending 2,400 USD worth of MANA (using the current market price).\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOver the past year, the DAO Committee has been proven essential for the regular operations of the DAO. However this position has been voluntary for almost a year, and it requires substantial work from the members of the committee to cover their responsibilities.\n\nSetting compensation for its members is key to attracting qualified candidates to join the committee and securing the timely operations of the DAO long-term.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fa6a3040-338a-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8)**",

This is a request to keep current structure but also allow an additional ability to use EYE_MAT on 3D wearables also.\n\nMOTIVATION\nThere have been 3D assets, skins or new designs that cannot customise their eye colours due to the limits of the current Eye_MAT structure. After the implementation of RGB hair, the demand has increased for Eye_Mat to be reviewed.\n\nThis can even go further to implement Skin_Mat and Eye_Mat to be a RGB style tint rather than set colours moving forward for more design outcomes.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION PATHWAYS\n\nIf governance is successful an update will be added to the product teams roadmap.\n\nPlease feel free to leave any feedback!\n\n- Support Implementation of Eye_Mat\n- Disagree, should stay png only\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=18873bf0-32c7-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8)**",

    "body": "> by 0x336685bb3a96e13b77e909d7c52e8afcff1e859e (michitodd)\n\nSUMMARY\nThis is a proposal to set up an intermediate waiting period \"cooling period\" for new wearable collections to allow returns or refunds if there’s any unexpected issues.\n\nABSTRACT\nCurrently there has been frustration from customers purchasing from creators that shortly after have their wearable disabled due to IP infringement or not owning the rights to a design they submitted. As the space is still new knowledge around Creative Commons or design ownership is still quite fresh and so to protect the buyer from being at a loss, there can be a waiting time for new collections so if any issue arises there can be a refund request within the initial 14 day publishing period if a wearable is disabled or updated. Anyone holding this wearable can \"burn\" it to get a full refund from the held funds regardless of secondary sale or initial sale. Also implementing a \"burn\" feature wont devalue the product.\nThis cannot protect users from secondary sale on external platforms.\n\nThis wont solve larger issues but start a community dialog and also create a foundation for future framework to protect buyer confidence.\n\nMOTIVATION\nAfter multiple events of users buying from the marketplace and then no longer being able to use that wearable or the new wearable is updated to be completely different from the original purchase some buyers are now nervous or frustrated when supporting new collections. The safest shopping method at the moment is to buy from creators you know but with some extra security for the customer this can be a good buffer to ensure they have a bit of time to request a refund if things get disabled or changed.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION PATHWAYS\n\n*   Guidelines updated to reflect the change\n*   Information added to the terms of publishing to avoid confusion\n*   Announced in the discord, town hall and possibly socials\n*   Smart contract for sellers to be updated to have a payment delay for new collections\n*   A count-down added into the UI so users can see how many days they have left before their cooling period is complete\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis delay on creators will cure reluctance to buy from new creators in the space and also create a safety net for buyers. It will hopefully avoid future use of dao funds for refund requests if IP infringement disables numerous collections and also curve the creators looking to publish with ill intent.\nOn a positive note I hope this will also encourage users that publish only to then leave to stay longer in the platform as they wait for their funds (resulting in a single first payment) and extend their Decentraland experience!\n\nSome key feedback I've received but can't really solve is around how will users know when an item has been disabled or updated. I think this needs to be a larger discussion and seperate governance around updating/disabling and the UI design for wearables.\n\n- Cooling Down period 14 Days\n- Cooling Down Period 30 Days\n- Instant Payment with No Cooldown\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e71002a0-32bc-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8)**",

    "body": "> by 0x364811363c698cb1c46de4f11ccdec96fbac9991 (Miautz#9991)\n\nShould the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\n**Funding to buy 1 test parcel**\n\nWe plan to design and integrate intuitive informational screens that allow users to teleport within DL, which dramatically will increase the UX of mobility inside DL. DL currently doesn´t have a solution that allows broadcasting mixed media in real time to various destinations within their metaverse.\n\nThese informational screens will be financed via high quality advertisements of renown companies (max. 55% of broadcast time), through Precision X, a partner company of Germany´s biggest out of home (OOH) advertiser. 10% of the ad revenue will be saved for DL to finance the real-world advertisements on selcted OOH and digital-OOH (DOOH) screens, if desired (otherwise will be transferred to the DL-DAO wallet).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x364811363c698Cb1c46De4F11CcdEC96FBac9991\n\n## Email address\n\nmichael@precisionx.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe informational screens will present various content, including DL events, streams, ads. **The screens will offer an intuitive teleporting solution that will dramatically improve the user experience of mobility inside DL. The system will give us, for the first time, the opportunity to experiment with broadcasting activities in the virtual world to the real world through a unique playout system.** The content of the screens will be curated and distributed in a fun and engaging way that matched the DL ethos.\n\nAllowing for creative and engaging presentation of mixed content in the Metaverse, will give DL a competitive advantage in this emerging market.\n\nLinear and interactive simultaneous media streaming opens up the door to create more engagement in the Metaverse environment, thus offering more value for our customers who express their concern with the current engagement issues of existing Metaverse environments.\n\n**The screen will show various content, like:**\n\n•\tDecentraland maps, events, POI\n\n•\tDecentraland specific advertisement of e.g., upcoming events, marketplace offers, etc.\n\n•\tHigh quality ad campaigns of globally renown companies (max. 55% broadcast time; international advertisements in many languages)\n\n**Give back for the Decentraland foundation:**\n\nThe Decentraland foundation is allowed to advertise on selected real-world OOH and DOOH billboards once this proposal has been accepted and informational screens have been deployed in DL. Additionally, 10% of the total ad revenue\\* will be saved and used to partly finance the real-world advertising, if desired - otherwise these funds will be transferred to the DL-DAO and can be used for other purposes. The total ad revenue will be revealed according to the data security rules in Germany, i.e., aggregated total ad revenue with blanked names, at the end of each month for transparency.\n\n**Give back for users that install Precision X informational screens (via builder):**\n\nWe will always save a certain number of wearables of our exclusive partners, once they decide to offer limited wearables to users that interact with the brands´ experience, and airdrop these to users who have installed the informational screens on their parcels (randomized).\n\nWe plan to integrate non-branded informational screens in official Decentraland parcels (Plazas), themed areas, and we want to offer these screens as an official builder asset for free wearable drops.\n\nWe, a collective of four companies, want to offer the whole Decentraland community an informational screen solution, to aim for higher user traffic, ramp up the Decentraland-PR, and to enhance the in-game experience for every user.\n\n**Benefits at a glance:**\n\n•\tEnhancement of in-game experience via event panel- and map integration\n\n•\tBroadcasting capabilities of the next generation\n\n•\tAirdrop of exclusive wearables to users who install informational screens on their land (random)\n\n•\tSelected access to the billboard network (OOH/ DOOH), if desired\n\n•\t10% of the ad revenue\\* will be saved to partly finance the real-world ads for Decentraland, if desired (it will otherwise be transferred to the DL-DAO for other purposes)\n\no\tTransparency: total ad revenue will be disclosed at the end of each month in an aggregated manner, with blanked company names, to align with the data security rules in Germany\n\n•\t**Our partners = PR = more traffic**\n\n\\*Discounts and any commissions are deducted from the calculation of ad revenue.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe already have a prototype which runs in developement mode. Please have a look at the two following videos for a demo:\n\n**Video 1:**\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1PBgZ\\_0dIqcbWz-bRZX\\_8Tjn8N1ZZmqyg/view\n\n**Video 2:**\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1GDY9pMm3FwQvNHmSqYjao2vPg9Pdrn4V/view\n\n**Details:**\n\nThe technical solution is being developed by three companies. The funding will happen via high quality content of Precision X´s clients (max. 55% broadcasting time, the other 45% is solely Decentraland content, like events, streams from within the Metaverse, etc.).\n\nVoxelArchitects have created the informational screen assets upon request of Precision X. They will deploy the informational screens within DL if the proposal is being accepted.\n\ndoWow creates the functionality of the screen, allowing users to jump to the content that is being presented on the screens. Additionally, doWow allows to show various content at the same time, all on one screen.\n\nAdShares will provide the ad server to change the content on the fly. The server is a private server that is being used by Precision X only (brand safety).

    "title": "Expanding Ethermon District RPG Play-to-Earn Gameplay [Guilds, Quests & PvP]",
    "body": "> by 0xee9a8b81b85e23c101776a8580d73002dc4d8915\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nEthermon is a play-to-earn game ecosystem, revolving around dynamic “Mon” NFTs. It launched as the first NFT battle game on Ethereum in 2017.\n\nWhen the original team decided to end development, the most passionate players stepped up and took over the project in 2019. This has been a community-driven project ever since.\n\nWe have been building in Decentraland for close to 2 years now, aiming to deliver Decentraland’s first in-depth, MMORPG inspired game. We have made a TON of progress.\n\nThis would be our second grant. The first grant, which allowed us to expand the team and deliver the features for our Alpha 2.0 version, can be found here:\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e122d240-95ce-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xEe9A8b81B85e23c101776a8580D73002Dc4d8915\n\n## Email address\n\neric@ethermon.io\n\n## Description\n\nOur team has dedicated close to 2 years now building the Ethermon District into the best RPG experience possible — focusing on gameplay before monetization. Since the beginning of our previous grant, we have not sold ANY in-game content within Decentraland.\n\nThe funding requested would allow us to continue to scale to achieve the ambitious goals detailed in the Beta 1.0 section of our roadmap below. Now that we have completed our first closed “gameplay loops” and base mechanics, we are ready to deliver on-chain paid content, P2P monetization and link it all to our tokenomics. These features would create sustainability for the project.\n\nJump into our District Plaza at \\[76,51]. Claim free Mons to get started. Check out the Player House at \\[79, 46]. Explore the custom UI's for inventories, storage, changing Mons on a team, changing battle moves on a Mon, burning loot for essence & crafting. Visit the Forest Biome at \\[86, 51] and defeat enemies, level up, gather loot & resources, earn in the weekly Leaderboard Event & summon bosses.\n\nHere is a screen capture of me with one of the Mythic Mons: https://imgur.com/n8vR0Jb\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe launched the pre-alpha version of the Ethermon District in April 2021. We launched the Alpha 1.0 version between April 2021 and March 2022. We launched the Alpha 2.0 version between March 2022 and now (very much thanks to our previous grant).\n\nBelow are some of the key milestones achieved in Alpha 2.0 (post-grant):\n\nAlpha 2.0\n\nThe Alpha 2.0 version of Ethermon in DCL expanded on Alpha 1.0’s base by adding optimization, social aspects, earning potential & progression.\n\nIn addition to the highlights below, we also pushed many balancing adjustments, bug fixes & code improvements.\n\n1.  Major District Optimizations - we completely reworked our code, assets & load strategies to make the experience smoother for our players.\n\n2.  WebSocketServer - We added WSS not only so that our many scenes can work together seamlessly (having your Mon follow you across scene boundaries, keep real time stats when switching scenes, etc.), but also so that you can see other player's Mons! WSS is something we will continually update as we add more and more social experiences, and the game naturally transitions from single player -> multiplayer.\n\n3.  Weekly P2E Leaderboard Events - each week we have been hosting a weekly leaderboard event where our users defeat enemies in turn based/skill-based battles and earn points based on enemies defeated.\n\n4.  Added 117 New Mons - Our goal is to add every single Ethermon into DCL - fully modeled/animated, with custom move sets, probabilities, skill points, etc. We are constantly adding more and more (there are 300+), but since the time of our last proposal we have added 117 new ones!\n\n5.  Complete UI Upgrade - We have upgraded all of our UI. Load times are smoother and the HUDs are much more optimized. Some examples of upgrades include HUDs for: changing your Mon team, switching Mons within a team, backpack for loot, storage for excess loot, switching battle moves on a Mon, seeing real time point stats (individual), seeing real time point stats (leaderboard), burning loot for essence & also crafting.\n\n6.  Crafting – This was Part 1 of our biggest update yet. All of the loot you collect from battling can be used to craft “Equipment”. Each equipment has its own crafting recipes and unique benefits. With 8 different “types” of equipment, you can attach them to your Mons to receive stats boosts and custom buffs. In addition, you can craft items, that when combined, allow you spawn 1 of 6 different bosses. See below.\n\n7.  Bosses – This was Part 2 of our biggest update yet. In Biome 1 (first battle area in the district) there are 6 different bosses that can be spawned, each with custom stats, elements, move sets, loot and models/textures. Bosses drop extremely rare equipment and are difficult to defeat. They have been built in a way that allows us to quickly and easily deliver bosses for each of the subsequent Biomes, which will create a natural progression for the players.\n\n8.  Biome 2 – All of the models, textures, enemies and loot have already been completed. We are ready to push, but were waiting to release updates 6 & 7 above, which we just pushed at the end of August.\n\n9.  Consumable Items – Similarly, consumable items have been developed and are ready for release in the crafting menus and our soon to be “item shops”.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nCore Team\n\nOur core team includes game design, metaverse, and blockchain industry experts.\n\n•\tEric (EB), Co-Founder and 3D Lead\n•\tIdon, Co-Founder and Blockchain Tech Lead\n•\tJamie, COO\n•\tNycolas, Lead Game Designer & Front-End Developer\n•\tInihility, Senior Full Stack Developer\n•\tJuxton, Front-End Developer\n•\tMohib (Mariana44), Back-End Developer/Smart Contract Developer\n•\tKhushal, Full-Stack Developer\n•\tHetal, Junior Front-End Developer\n•\tPolygonal Minds (Lau and Hugo), 3D Artists\n•\tArpesh, 3D Artist\n•\tJavid, 2D Artist\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nQ4 2022 / Q1 2023 — Beta 1.0\n\nWe are ready to move towards the Beta version of development, which will truly make the game play-to-earn, social & expansive, as well as create monetizable gameplay for serious players, casual players, F2P players, guilds & collectors/whales alike.\n\nOur first versions of the game created a base layer and a closed gameplay loop. Along with further optimizations, balance changes, more Mons & expandable progression, our goal is now to add content that will make the game sustainable, as well as create an economy for all types of players.\n\nMilestone Goals:\n\nGuilds - create a guild, recruit members, upgrade a sharable guild \"house\", compete against other guilds\n\nQuests - both for individuals and for groups. Complete guild \"quests\" to unlock content & speed up progression\n\nMultiplayer PvE and PvP - fight enemies & bosses together as a guild. Compete in guild tournaments\n\nP2P Monetization - buy/sell/trade items and resources in world (think OSRS Grand Exchange on an individual & guild level)\n\nPlayer Skills - outside of battling and leveling up Mons, progress individual gathering & crafting skills\n\nAdditional Biomes - we will add additional \"Biomes\" to create natural progression, more depth, and higher level content\n\nOur game has been largely single-player focused, with all earning potential being on the individual level. To truly create an in-game economy, we need to deliver a multiplayer experience with shared incentives and earning\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=cb035b60-3146-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8)**",

    "title": "Building San Fransisco City Hall for weddings in Decentraland",
    "body": "> by 0x06c5a46025d3dcee9f244172ad17b97339a9f321 (Maff#f321)\n\nShould the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe institution of marriage was created in 2350 B.C. However, there are still a lot of restrictions on marrying a person you love, if your couple doesn't suit the traditional scope. We believe that the metaverse can help discriminated couples register their marriage on the blockchain.\nMaff Metaverse creates San Fransisco City Hall where people of any nationality,  gender,  orientation,  age, and religion can have a wedding. At the end of the ceremony, a newlywed couple will receive an NFT certificate of marriage.\nWe aim to take the experience of marrying in the metaverse to a new level. Maff Metaverse has already held a wedding ceremony at the beach location that was created for the event.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x06C5A46025d3dCEe9F244172AD17b97339A9F321\n\n## Email address\n\nmaffmetaverse@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nHolding weddings in the metaverse can be a great addition to traditional ceremonies. They are not limited in the number of guests and can be visited from anywhere in the world.\nCoronavirus restrictions have forced people to look for a way out of the ban on events around the world. Many couples have realized that digital weddings can be a real alternative to traditional ceremonies.\nIn order to integrate weddings into the Decentraland community, the City Hall location will provide an opportunity to get married in the metaverse for everyone despite gender, age, religion, orientation, or nationality.\nThe virtual space becomes not just a wedding ceremony decoration, but also a platform for entertainment. Guests can not only watch the wedding from the outside but also participate in various quests.\nTo celebrate a traditional wedding, all the necessary locations must be booked in advance. Due to high demand, people are on waiting lists for locations for months. And a virtual wedding can be arranged in no time due to the special mechanics that will be installed at the San Fransisco City Hall location.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nSan Fransisco City Hall will not be just a beautiful wedding place. Guests and a newlywed couple will be integrated into the process.\nThe main object of the location is the building in romantic colors: pink and white. Entering the main entrance, users will see the altar, NPC-priest, and the guests' area. On the right side, the screen, the dancing platform, and the DJ controller will be installed. On the left side, the users will find the photo zone, the buffet, and the gift zone. The second floor is filled with the technical rooms of the wedding palace.\nWe want to make the process of marriage as interesting as possible. One of the key roles in the wedding is dedicated to the NPC priest. All the lines of the dialogue will be translated to the special screen, so the guests will be able to see the dialogue. The gameplay will be addictive - the newlywed couple should find the hidden heart logos and bring them to the NPC priest to get to the second part of the ceremony. While collecting the coins, a big red heart will fill up with colors. When all logos are collected, the couple will be able to exchange the rings and finally receive an NFT certificate of digital marriage. The NFT will be generated automatically and will include the avatars’ photos, their names, and the date of the wedding ceremony. The NFT will also be seen to all the guests in the form of a pop-up banner.\nAt the end of the ceremony, the avatars will be able to fire a salute from the cannons installed outside of the building.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nMaff Metaverse has 2,5 years of working experience with the metaverses. We are building a strong community interested in digital reality whose aim is to popularize and develop metaverses. Our team consists of creators - both designers and developers - that we attract through online hackathons that we host. More than 60 creators participated in our first hackathon that was dedicated to building in Decentraland. Subsequently, the Maff Metaverse art park was created. It consists of the best 9 objects that were developed during the hackathon by our creators. What’s more, public areas like a flying space platform and stage were added to create the atmosphere of a festival.\n\nAs developers, we constantly improve our skills, always exploring the abilities of metaverses and implementing ideas that no one has ever done before. For example, on New year’s eve, we tested the phygital approach - connecting lights on the real Christmas tree with the one located in Decentraland. Our creators’ community attended the event in the metaverse and could change the color of the real physical tree by changing the lights in Decentraland.\nMaff Metaverse also has an experience in game development. We created a turtle parkour quest.  Those who made it to the last turtle received an NFT gift.\nWe also conducted a few projects: a party on a yacht, a showroom for a clothes brand, and a wedding. You can find more information on our website: https://metaverse.maff.io/en\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis project will take 2-3 months to develop and can be divided into three sections:\nSection 1.\nConcept and design development.\nSection 2.\nDevelopers' part.\nSection 3.\nImprovements, deploying the object.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=efa07010-2f58-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8)**",

Moreover, they are not aware of the appropriate channels to monetize their creations and do not have support from galleries and other established art players. At ***Espacio Creador***, we **want to create an interactive PhyGital experience** where digital artists, content creators, fashion and metaverse enthusiasts get together to **create and monetize digital art** disregarding their background. Our three LANDs  on Decentraland will be used to create immersive experiences that interact with the art activations that we will do IRL. **These activations will attract traffic to Decentraland and  generate revenue for the DAO**.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n12,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xdEF79f2b0e466260B1E87264d327d03De0EAc50c\n\n## Email address\n\nandres.fonseca@itrmachines.com\n\n## Description\n\nOne of the **key drivers for metaverse adoption** is the incentivization of users to **enter virtual worlds and spend time in them**. To achieve this, it is necessary to create interactive experiences that **increase traffic and help onboarding the masses** to ***Decentraland***.\n\n**Espacio Creador’s main premise is to create new opportunities** for artists through the convergence of art and technology and the development of multiverse experiences that leverage Decentraland, NFTs, VR and AR to take the next step towards the real adoption of Web 3.0.\n\nThe **pilot for the project** will be a **phygital event** taking place in Decentraland, the website of Espacio Creador (https://escreador.wtf), as well as in real life at Simonette Boutique in Bogota, Colombia (https://simonetteboutique.com/). The event will have live Djs (both in real live and in the metaverse),  live street art/VR performance from renowned Colombian artists such as Ceroker https://www.instagram.com/ceroker/, Tres Manos Studio  https://www.instagram.com/atresmanosestudio/, and the launch of a wearable collection by Kaftan https://kaftan.com.co/.\n\n**The Espacio Creador is conceived as a space for co-creation and promotion of creative disciplines**, covering the areas of design, technology, fashion, plastic- , visual- , sound- , interactive arts and new media.\n\nIt aims to **enable environments where these areas converge, allowing experimentation and creation**. These environments will be focused on strengthening the culture and art of developing cultures as well as their recognition both locally and internationally. In addition to this, **Espacio Creador aims to strengthen the art industry through the creation of innovative diffusion channels which allow new ways to perceive and consume culture.**\n\nTo this end, the creative space offers a series of environments and channels, both digital and physical, which together form an ecosystem of extended interaction, with the intention of covering a wide range of artistic intentions. The Espacio Creador will take three main channels into consideration to allow the interaction between creators, enthusiasts and art buyers:\n\n*   Metaverse=\n\n1.  Decentraland\n\n*   Digital Realm=\n\n1.  Dapps\n2.  Virtual Reality\n3.  Augmented Reality\n4.  RRSS\n\n*   Physical Realm=\n\n1.  Galleries\n2.  Events\n3.  Performances\n4.  Print media\n\nRegarding the metaverse diffusion channel we chose Decentraland because of its advanced state of development, thriving community, real decentralised character and huge upside potential.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Concept**\n\nThe creative space in Decentraland is conceived as a hybrid minimalist building with big exhibition floors. The experience aims to prioritise the exhibition spaces by using large rooms that are interconnected by floating corridors, offering the visitor a dynamic tour through the building\n\n**Architecture**\n\n*   The architectural style for the creative space is inspired in minimalist futurism with large geometrically oriented spaces, viewpoints and external corridors with a dynamic character.\n\n*   Given the technical limitations and the planned aesthetic for the experience, we will develop orthogonal geometric forms with bevels, and a high presence of diagonals that dynamize the forms without overloading the mesh with polygons.\n\n*   We will build large halls that highlight the work exhibited in conjunction with the architecture. These halls will be connected by open-air elevated corridors with platforms, floating walls  and terraces with a minimalist futuristic touch.\n\n*   We seek to experiment with sculptural ornaments embedded in the architecture that give a certain personification to the space, and that end up constituting a differentiating style with other spaces in Decentraland.\n\n**Exhibition Spaces**\n\n*   16:9 Rooms - 16:9 aspect ratio rooms that allow the best possible portrayal of works of this size.\n\n*   Floating Walls - Walls that are not connected to the rest of the building in any way, and that show exhibition screens or sculptures in ways that would be impossible in reality.\n\n*   Transparent Ceilings and Floors - In some rooms we will look for works to be displayed on the ceiling and on second floor layers that can be observed from a specific viewing angle.\n\n*   Large screens - The aim is to introduce large screens with animated or video content to create an object that can be appreciated for a long time.\n\n**Tour**\n\nThe primary goal of the tour is to offer the visitor an experience of non-linear prolonged interest, that can be explored in different ways and which captures the attention of the observer due to its dynamic character. This tour will take the visitor through rooms of different dimensions and distributions, through long corridors and surfaces with characteristics similar to those of platform games, which force the user to jump, eventually fail and have to try again.\nFinally, we will offer easy exit access, such as open windows or possibilities of falling into floating corridors, which do not force the visitor to return to the entrance to leave the building at the moment he/she wishes to do so.\n\n***Use of Funds***\n\n**The grant will be used to pay part of the development costs of Espacio Creador hub in  LAND \\[\"-61,45\",\"-61,46\",\"-62,45\"]** in accordance with the previous requirements and **prepare multiple activation event for Espacio Creador both in the virtual and in the real world**. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to **attract more traffic to Decentralad and foster the adoption of the metaverse**. This will be achieved through the continuous promotion of Decentraland and all its features across the series of events organised by Espacio Creador, over our webpage (https://escreador.wtf/) and social networks. Each art activation will be done with the purpose of co-creating a wearable collection between all the artists involved in it which will allow multiple artists, designers and boutiques to impersonate their brands in the metaverse and increase the adoption of Decentraland\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nWe are a **team of multidisciplinary entrepreneurs** with multiple years of added experience in the metaverse, art, fashion, design and music industries.The project is a spinoff of the MetaGameHub DAO (Metaverse Infrastructure Provider), Kaftan (Fashion Brand) and Light Skills Dojo (Artists Collective)\n\n**Andrés Fonseca**\n\n*   Role: Operations at Espacio Creador\n*   Relevant Credentials (e.g.): LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andresfonsecad/\n*   Background/Experience:\n    Blockchain & Tech entrepreneur\n    Digital Art Collector\n    Metaverse expert\n\n**Camilo Molina**\n\n*   Role: Developer at Espacio Creador\n*   Relevant Credentials (e.g.): LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/camilo-molina-69215758/\n*   Background/Experience:\n    Game developer\n    AR and VR Developer focus on immersive experiences\n    Multimedia developer\n\n**Julian Sandoval**\n\n*   Role: Digital Creator at Espacio Creador\n*   Relevant Credentials (e.g.): LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonniedeldojo/\n*   Background/Experience:\n    Media Artist\n    Graphic Designer\n\n**Camilo Echeverri**\n\n*   Advisor at Espacio Creador\n*   Relevant Credentials (e.g.): LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/caem2017/\n*   Background/Experience:\n    3 Years Experience in the indexing and banking industry\n    DAOs and NFTs and metaverse expert\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Communication plan rollout September**\n\n*   Weekly post during one month about the event across 4 channels (MetaGameHub, Kaftan, Espacio Creador, Dojo)\n*   Twitter Spaces talking about the status quo of decentraland, the fashion industry and dthe art world in Latam\n\n**Metaverse Development September-October**\n\n1.  **Activities**\n\n*   Experimentation\n*   Design\n\n1.  **Deliverables**\n\n*   Doc with the parameters of the virtual space\n\n2.  **Activities**\n\n*   Modelling and texturing development\n*   Animation development\n\n2.  **Deliverables**\n\n*   Models, textures and animations\n\n3.  **Activities**\n\n*   Behaviours and Interactions\n\n3.  **Deliverables**\n\n*   Intelligent objects\n\n4.  **Activities**\n\n*   Lighting and VFX development\n\n4.  **Deliverables**\n\n*   Textures and particles\n\n5.  **Activities**\n\n*   Deployment\n\n6.  **Deliverables**\n\n*   Space in Decentraland\n\n**Launch Event October 20th**\n\nLaunch Event of the Espacio Creador with a phygital experience including multiple NFT drops (membership NFTs, Decentraland wearables and 1o1s of the involved artists), a fully developed Decentraland scene that will host all events related to Espacio Creador, and the whole logistics/promotion for the artist activation that will be done on that date.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9a9c4f70-2e50-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8)**",

To help make Decentraland's data more easily accessible in a permissioned way, and to scale solutions like [scene comparisons](https://analytics.wemeta.world/scenes/compare-scenes) and more seamlessly offer creators [scene dashboards](https://analytics.wemeta.world/scenes/dashboard), WeMeta is seeking to work with the community to implement our analytics at a world level.\n\n### How\n\nIn practice, this would mean implementing the Builder Tag at scale, so that builders do not have to manually add it to their scenes. Visitors would be given notice that their data is being collected, and given the opportunity to opt-out or visit their profile on wemeta.world to understand what is being collected and how it is being used.\n\n### Why\n\nWe believe users should have control over their data. This means they should be able to opt-out, delete, or adjust the level of granularity at which their data can be utilized. Through this future feature, we hope to be able to reward people when their data is used (e.g. advertisement).\n\nFor this reason, we are asking the community to back us in our mission to scale our analytics service to all of Decentraland, while giving users ownership of their data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, we believe this could be powerful step forward for democratized data, enabling a simple solution to contribute and monetize your data.\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=870755f0-2e36-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8)**",

    "body": "> by 0xd6e62a97a55537cd04847bb73e22208bd20106aa (DCLCurations)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nDCL Curations has been developing educational material, hosting community events and promoting Decentraland since 2020. Now, we are looking to bring all of that together in a fun, gamified experience that will help onboard new users to the metaverse, showcase DCL creators, and encourage users to explore.\n\nWe’ve acquired a 16x estate where Phase 1 of the Curation Station has been released and will be the hub for the Virtual Library. Players will be able to earn Library credits by completing various Library quests and will be incentivized to check out books (virtual courses) from the Library in order to receive/upgrade wearables that unlock secret rooms, items, and eventually new Questlines that will introduce PvE and Multiplayer components.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n59,600 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x6a8A014De91d50BA053E43bDe0eaf30D41CbB5f7\n\n## Email address\n\nDCLCurations@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe initial goal of the Virtual Library is to offer engaging educational material about different individuals and organizations in Decentraland. We have created a method for streamlined production and also will release a process for others to submit videos/courses to the Library. While the course material is currently focused on DCL, we plan to accept all kinds of courses in the future to include other material.\n\n**Needs / goals that will be satisfied:**\n\n• Decentraland is growing rapidly and every experience has different components and requirements to participate (tokens used, social medias to engage with, event schedules, game mechanics, etc.). For example:\n\n     o DG has multiple currencies on multiple chains and participating in $ICE Poker requires specific wearables, staking, activations, delegation and more\n\n     o The Decentraland Report uses Xpand as their social media platform, has tokenized music NFTs, $REPORT tokens, and more\n\n     o This results in a high barrier to entry for most individuals as it requires learning about completely new concepts and items for every experience they want to participate in\n\n• Developing high-quality onboarding videos is very time consuming and often takes a backseat to the continued development work of DCL experiences\n\n**This grant will fund:**\n\n• The creation of educational onboarding videos for groups across Decentraland\n\n• Creation of gamified educational experiences in the CurationStation with future plans for gamification across Decentraland that encourage users to learn and explore what DCL has to offer\n\n• And will foster growth within DCL communities by breaking down complex ecosystems in easily digestible ways to onboard users\n\n**Description of feature / content:**\n\n• The current Library floor plan will be expanded and include new functionality (e.g. moveable ladders, integrated virtual courses, NPCs, item spawn points, and games)\n\n• Talking to the Librarian, users can complete an initial quest to receive a Library Card which gives users access to an introductory set of courses\n\n• Users can then complete additional quests to receive Library Credits and access additional virtual courses\n\n• Initially, courses (~1-5min) will be created by DCL Curations in partnership with the organization that the course covers – at no cost to the organization – and includes:\n\n     o Script development and review with group\n\n     o Audio recording\n\n     o Visual recording\n\n     o Video editing\n\n     o Final review and edits\n\n     o Course upload / Hosting in Library\n\n• Later, courses will also be able to be submitted to the team for review to ensure content accuracy. Accepted courses will be integrated in the Virtual Library & the creators will receive a cash reward from the Grant Course Creation Budget (payment amount TBD)\n\n**Skills / experience that will contribute to success:**\n\n• We have a team of top DCL Advisors and developers with design, modeling, SDK, and backend architecture skills that are working together to deliver a seamless experience to the DCL community\n\n• We have created a 10-part educational series for Decentral Games which is representative of the courses we will be creating for other DCL groups\n\n• Our current understanding of the inter-workings of many prominent groups in DCL allows for quicker development / review of video scripts\n\n**Links**\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DCLCurations\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dclcurations/\n\nWebsite: https://www.dclcurations.com/\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Tools**\n\nVideo recording – OBS\n\nVideo editing – Wondershare Filmora\n\nGraphic Design – Adobe Illustrator / Photoshop\n\n3D Modeling / Animations – Blender\n\nCoding – DCL SDK\n\n**Interactive Books**\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/997914794541727784/1016770351897784430/unknown.png\n\n**Library Draft UI**\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/997914794541727784/1016770374031126609/unknown.png\n\n**Wearable Concept Designs**\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/997914794541727784/1016770869864972338/unknown.png\n\n**Basic Video Series:**\n\n1.

It is currently on a 7x7 estate located at coordinates 126, 44. Our goal is to create a fun and vibrant gaming community with a player-driven economy; by which, individuals can own items in the form of blockchain assets that they can buy/sell/trade as they please. Our experienced team of programmers, designers, and support personnel bring years of talent to enable us to meet this goal.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x5117571b0BEc00372CE00870ad8E523C704a78b7\n\n## Email address\n\njtv@exodusgbw.io\n\n## Description\n\nDecentraland (DCL) allows for an immense amount of personal creativity and freedom. DCL creates the opportunity to engage with others in novel ways in an expansive virtual space; be that by attending concerts and galleries or playing games. We seek to expand on the gaming options within DCL by building Exodus: Goodbye World!\nWe feel that having a large-scale, frequently updated game within the DCL platform will provide years of entertainment and financial value to the community. It will help drive increased user traffic into DCL and to the overall DCL gaming scene. Exodus aims to be massive, immersive, and create an engaging player experience. Initially set in a medieval era, players will be able to train their skills, gather a variety of resources, craft tools & equipment, and even earn NFTs through gameplay. As we approach and overcome the challenges of hosting a huge variety of items on-chain, we will eventually bridge in-game resources to public blockchain(s). This will help create a player driven Play-and-Earn economy where players can truly own the results of their hard in-game work. In developing Exodus, we have a heavy focus on educational outreach. We are providing opportunities for interns and community members who want to be part of our journey. Whether the focus is design or software development, our team environment is supportive of those who want to learn and contribute to the project.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nExodus has already started its Beta. Throughout the beta we will be creating and adding portions of the game on a regular schedule. Before launching the Beta we worked passionately on the front-end and back-end infrastructure to ensure the basic gaming mechanics were enabled. This included the Inventory interface, Banking functionality, Daily challenges, Leveling system, Beta Currency, and three gaming objectives – Woodchopping, Fishing, and Mining. We also created the scenery and over 100 assets for use in the game.\n\nThe Beta of Exodus went live on June 20th, 2022 at coordinates 126,44. In the 12 weeks since, we have created and enabled an in-game Merchandise interface, rolled out Woodchopping, Scavenger Hunting, Fishing, and now Mining. Future releases will involve other skills and activities, including Forging, Workshopping, and Hunting. During beta, we will be writing an in-depth storyline so that Questing activities can be included post-beta.\n\nWe plan to continue to release major updates on a monthly basis, as permitted, until the full game completion. We aim to deliver minor bug fixes, quality of life updates, and patches on a weekly to biweekly basis. Please view our video that walks you through the beginning stages of our game: Exodus is in an open beta and will continue to further stress test the game’s infrastructure and prepare for public release.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=yxERzyH7G6s\n\nWe use a variety of technologies for software development, design, server maintenance, and project organization. This includes, but is not limited to: AWS, Discord, Github, Blender, the Adobe Suite, and Visual Studio.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nOur team is a group of video game enthusiasts who have a complimentary variety of skill and experience. This includes experience in blockchain applications, back-end infrastructure, the DCL SDK, graphic design, and 3D design & animation.

    "title": "Should we bring BUILDING as a type of asset just like wearable, and make it usable on Builder or other Official Editor? Securing the rights of creator.",
    "body": "> by 0x9b3ae2dd9eaad174cf5700420d4861a5a73a2d2a (MetaGamiMall)\n\nBack to the beginning of Decentraland, when Decentraland had just opened its world to the public, the most common thing we would do was build architecture, no wearable, not a lot of games. And, if we check Decentraland content now, we can still see the great importance of architecture in any kind of scene, whether it is a game or HQ or so.\n\nHowever, what has been confusing is that DCL has not included building as a type of asset that people can trade on the marketplace. So why not we add that into the market, and the building NFT holder can deploy them on their land by DCL Builder or the upcoming SDK 7?\n\nIf we check the Sandbox marketplace, we can see that there is a fair Building type asset market out there. If we can do the same here in Decentraland, that can potentially drive more activities from the builders and architects or even developers. And it would be a great source to lead to the prosperity of the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nBy the way, they don't need to be a whole building, it can be a door or a smart item on the marketplace, but it needs to be an NFT that can be used on DCL builder (or other official editors) to secure the right of their creators so that they can potentially gain profits or reputation out of it, and have more willingness to keep developing good quality stuff. Otherwise, if the creator develops something and sends the file to other people, then this item will soon become public lol.\n\nIt is a good thing to open source resources, but we have to give this choice back to the creator to decide if they want to open source or not, now they have no choice if they want to do something like this. (at least no mature solution like wearable creators)\n\nIt makes sense this proposal might have some barriers to cross, but I think it would be a good thing to bring it to the table and have some discussion.\n\nGo, continue the legacy of architecture culture in Decnetraland.\n\n- Yes, we do need it badly\n- Yes, but we need to wait and see\n- No, we don't need it\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fe612aa0-2c50-11ed-ac99-5bece7edccd0)**",

    "body": "> by 0xa77610fcb5288bc95849c64136df159dd3efe6ac (MetaArchs)\n\n**Plazas: Built *By* the Community, *For* the Community**\n\n*TLDR: Is it the community's place to begin having a conversation on how Plazas can be used? This poll aims to answer this, with the hope of giving the community more agency and space to be able to begin utilizing the vast amounts of stagnant space found in Plazas.*\n\nDecentraland's community is composed of a buzzing, talented group of individuals, which have a multitude of different ways in which they can contribute to the growth and development of the platform.\n\nHowever, despite these ideas, talents, and capacities, one major limiting factor curbs and limits individuals from being able to actively test, develop and deploy their ideas to the world; land.\n\nDespite being the most crucial resource for developing ideas and experiences on the platform, DCL land remains a very scarce and high-costing asset.\n\nCurrently, the majority of our Plazas stand stagnant; unused, underdeveloped and sometimes, uninspiring, with not much activity, events, or engaging experiences being offered to users in such spaces.  Some Plazas, such as the northern and southern Forest Plazas, are direct copies of each other, and leave much to be desired from the average user.\n\nThis *can* and *should* change.\n\nPlazas are a perfect space to be able to host a multitude of different events, whilst also offering space to community members to begin building the platform they wish to see.  DAO Town Halls, NGO Projects, Educational Experiences, Metaverse Festivals, and even large-scale, one-time events, can all be built and developed in communal plaza spaces; all aimed at scaling and building active users, engaged community members, and a co-owned, community-centric mentality towards DCL Event organizing and scene building.\n\n**What happens if this poll passes?**\n\nThis poll aims to first test the sentiments of the community regarding the utilization of plaza space. Should this poll pass, it would be prudent to begin having open discussions on different plans for plaza spaces, and how they can best be utilized for organic community growth.\n\nShould the open discussions be fruitful, those discussions will be compiled into a draft proposal, which can begin outlining how community members can begin actively contributing to the revitalization of plazas.\n\nSuch ideas can then begin feeding into structured follow-up polls, which can encompass key strategies which focus on the revitalization of specific plazas (such as rebuilding the southern Forest Plaza into a DAO Community Plaza).\n\n- Yes: We should begin open discussion on how to best utilise plazas.\n- No: The Community should have no input on how Plazas are built and utilised. \n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9987c5a0-2bf4-11ed-ac99-5bece7edccd0)**",

Actually, when the grantee does not comply with the basic  [terms and conditions](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/receiving-grants/)  of the Grants program, it is defined that the grant must be revoked but not *who should do it*.\n\n    After this decision is made, we will establish and document the procedure for **revoking grants, making this publicly available for the community to have clarity on how we are moving forward.**\n\n*   **2.** **We will review the practices that raised concerns** based on the input given by the community, and seize the opportunity to reexamine Grant’s terms and conditions.\n\nSo, the question still remains:\n\n**Who should make the decision of revoking grants?**\n\n*   **Community Decides:** The Grant Support Squad presents each case with our arguments and recommendations *to the Community* and asks if the Grant should be revoked.\n\n*   **DAO committee decides:** The Grant Support Squad presents each case with our arguments and recommendations *to the DAO Committee* to decide if the grant should be revoked.\n\n*   **New committee decides:** The Grant Support Squad presents each case with our arguments and recommendations and assigns the responsibility to decide to a NEW Committee, which specifically addresses these matters.\n\n*   **Random, rotative and voluntary Jury decides:** The Grant Support Squad presents each case with our arguments and recommendations, for a Jury to decide if the grant should be revoked.\n\n*   **Do nothing.**\n\nWe’d love to hear your opinion regarding the decision making.

For each challenge players must solve simple game tasks based on existing content. This will orient players and enable pathfinding. After each challenge, players will be able to claim a free IK NFT. After claiming each of the four challenge NFTs, players can then claim an overarching Achievement Trophy NFT to show completion of all four minigames. Optional: After 1 month, a random drawing to reward those who collected the final achievement NFT.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xD4076B05a720d263993BC5801d74692D1588C68A\n\n## Email address\n\nandy@infinitykeys.io\n\n## Description\n\nInfinity Keys is a creator tools platform to enable anyone to build and launch Web3-capable challenges, including treasure hunt-style puzzles for activation events.\n\nPresently, the Infinity Keys team is the first platform user, creating hunts to demonstrate how puzzles can lead to significant engagement through working with partner brands and projects to launch the first season of coordinated, composable hunts with Web3 benefits. We’re offering to provide this experience for the Decentraland community.\n\nOur aim in the future is that IK will evolve into a platform where community members can submit and QA puzzle modules as templates, and then projects can use those templates to host engaging quests for their own content. Like decentralized Roblox for casual puzzle games using Web3 composability and treasure.\n\nFor now, we are working with existing Web3 projects to provide extended engagement for existing content to help fill up space in the metaverse with more and more content as users onboard. While we build these experiences we are continuing to grow our available features for hunts, challenges, and puzzles to help projects give their users actually engaging games instead of surface-level contests and impression-based promotions.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe IK Team will design and implement a “Pack” of three challenges across projects in Decentraland. For a simple example of a Pack, please play with the IK Starter Pack: <https://www.infinitykeys.io/pack/starter-pack>. Each requirement has its own challenge (which can be multi-step), and players must solve a simple riddle, solve an anagram using the IK Thesis, and find IK values in our Discord channel.\n\nFor the Decentraland Pack, we will create multi-step challenges inside Decentraland, such as locate object hunts on particular plots, hidden ciphers and passcodes, riddles based on text or lore, claiming in-world items, or signing guestbooks on particular plots.\n\nThe IK team will monitor relevant Decentraland Discord channels and maintain a dedicated Decentraland channel on our own server.\n\nThe IK team will launch social and signage assets in coordination with Decentraland and relevant project accounts to alert users that there are challenges and games to play.\n\nAt the conclusion of each challenge, players will be able to claim a free NFT on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, or Avalanche C-chain. These are Infinity Keys 1155 NFTs that feature different concepts, from themed art to ancient maps.\n\nWhile these NFTs are collectible by nature, collecting them can also be used as requirements for future Decentraland (or other) hunts.\n\nAfter claiming all three challenge NFTs, players are able to claim an overarching Pack Achievement. Players that claim this achievement will have demonstrated significant engagement across Decentraland and will be eligible for a randomly selected drawing for $500 in MANA to be selected and distributed at some predetermined end date. This step is optional.\n\nThe hunts and NFTs will remain available for play as long as the associated projects and lore remains available to keep the puzzle logic intact (e.g. if one of the partners changes their plot and removes the location of a passcode, the game will not function and either need to be revised or removed), but the incentive for a campaign-focused drawing will end at the predetermined date.\n\nHow it benefits the DCL Creator Community:\n\n*   Infinity Keys provides a place for DCL visitors to participate in treasure hunts, fostering a stronger sense of community and engagement through providing content and puzzles that engage curiosity and satisfaction.\n*   Decentraland community will collect NFTs, and be entered in a drawing for MANA, funded by this grant.\n*   Infinity Keys will continue building experiences for Decentraland, we will add functionality based on community feedbacks and ideas.\n*   Strengthen community ties and foster a stronger sense of belonging to Decentraland by creating hunts that allow people to collaborate together with friends and strangers to solve problems.\n\nThe budget for this proposal is $5000. The typical B2B price for this level of a designed 4-challenge package is $4,599. We have reduced that price in order to make $500 in MANA available as a player giveaway incentive. There are more substantial packages available in a subscription-type model, but we anticipate running this initial campaign as a pilot before approaching Decentraland DAO for recurring funding.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nInfinity Keys is a small team currently developing puzzles, infrastructure, an initial B2B model, and a small community of puzzle builders. We are in the midst of an angel funding round and will conduct additional fundraising to scale and turn the B2B model into a community-facing platform in the future. This proposal would effectively treat Decentraland as an entry-tier B2B client. We anticipate running this as a pilot with the ability to create many more nested and expansive hunts across Decentraland in the future.\n\n[Andy Boyan, Ph.D., Co-Founder](https://twitter.com/andyboyan)\n\nGage Mondok, Technical Co-Founder, (Twitter anon)\n\n[Elizabeth Barnes](https://twitter.com/ebethbarnes)\n\n[Aaron Bendersky](https://github.com/chair28980)\n\n[Hamilton Evans](https://github.com/ham-evans)\n\n[Tawnee Allport](https://github.com/stormcloud266), Front-end developer\n\n[Kori B.

Inspired by the Burning Man phenomenon, we created NFT Gallery QUANTUMSPACE, an artistic prototype of our assembly point in the metaverse Decentraland. It was a real Arrival for us! The divine hands and levitating stone are a symbol that contains the great power of art! Our gallery lasted a couple of months youtube.com/watch?v=kiPWXQE6JsA\nWe really want to reopen it, in a better way, but more on that later. Based on this concept of our prototype, we want to create a casual mobile game in the runner genre. After finishing the mobile game, the user will go to NFT Gallery QUANTUMSPACE in Decentraland. This will help attract an audience.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4A763F2d801906c321a9A46B3cC137C3439b59fA\n\n## Email address\n\nquantumspace.game@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe casual 3D mobile game QUANTUMSPACE IO/Android is a future PORTAL, a tunnel, an attraction, an allegorical bridge leading to our future NFT Gallery QUANTUMSPACE and into the metaverse Decentraland.\nGame description:\nPlan A:\nThe essence of the game is that a character on a board gets into a portal and rushes through it like a roller coaster, getting different visual experiences, collecting coins, dodging obstacles and more. The design and theme of the portal modules will echo that of the gallery in DCL.\n\nPlan B:\nPvP game, locations small planets, character collects items at speed with opponent\n(this idea was a priority at first, but I like the attraction idea better now!\nOption will be picked up at the stage of drawing up the terms of reference)\n\nartstation.com/artwork/B3LZP9 concept,creatives,3d sketch of Plan B game mechanics\nopensea.io/collection/qybertiger777 collection\n\nThis approach solves problems such as:\n\\-Attracting new users\n\\-Awareness of DCL\n\\-Involvement in DCL.\n\\-Gamifying the DCL registration process.\n\\-Awareness and familiarity with the gallery locations.\n\\-Promotion\n\\-Interaction\n\\-Example to implement a similar idea for DCL developers.\n\\-After game completion, an integrated gameplay must-have and quick guide on how to get to the gallery and DCL to continue playing.\n\\-A reward in the form of a ticket Qybertiger 7777 NTF, we will try to implement such an idea as adding a link to the address of the gallery in the DCL. www.artstation.com/artwork/D5reay\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAlso getting a grant will help us rent land for the gallery with the possibility of buying it, update the design, think about the gameplay of the quest in the gallery, and most importantly create a mobile game and gallery!\nWe are masters of conceptual art, with a voluminous and complex vision for the project. We really want to have a space to realize all our creative ideas in Decentraland where we could share, exhibit, sell and send art to the real world, for example, we can open locations with such themes, which we would like to implement in DCL in phases in the future:\n\\-3D architecture for DCL artstation.com/artwork/YKZYqY concepts.\n\\-Portals\n\\-Holograms\n\\-Paintings\n\\-Burning Man style sculptures\n\\-Toys\n\\-Design furniture\n\\-Live events and concerts, every day at the same time on our stage\n\\-Create a rave atmosphere with our talented composers of modern, atmospheric music https://abstrasensionrec.bandcamp.com/\n\\-Author vinyl records\n\\-Merch\n\\-NFT, 10% of profits to give to NFT owners, 10% of profits to give to homeless animal shelters\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nFounders of the idea\n\n1.

This simple yet effective option will help highlight and distinguish one Name from another whilst adding further utility and awareness.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nENS allows users to add many social links to individual domains, Decentraland should be no different. Linking social details to specific Names will help users get in contact when collaborating/negotiating.\n\nUsers could personalise their Names so they are easier to recognise or to display their hobbies/passions. Companies, businesses and brands would be able to display logos/slogans etc to their corresponding Name. Additionally, this could make it easier to differentiate specific names when browsing Names for sale.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDecentraland Names will no longer be dull and grey - The future is bright!\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2d4541a0-2858-11ed-ac99-5bece7edccd0)**",

This module will not only provide foundational interfaces to simplify the process of developing future card games in Decentraland, but would also provide a free scene that can be deployed onto land.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003\n\n## Email address\n\nthecryptotrader69@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nCard games have been, and still are, a massively popular type of game. While there are a few places in Decentraland where users can participate in card games, there are very few resources for the community to use when developing or deploying their own card games. The creation of a single set of utilities would go a long way to help establish the foundation for future card game development and would hopefully result in more games for the community. By providing better access to modules for developing entertainment content we could further cement Decentraland as one of the best places to participate in metaverse gaming.\n\nThis community module would feature the full game of Solitaire in the 3D space of Decentraland. Common definitions (card values and houses) and functions (placement, hand, and deck management) would all be relegated to external interfaces, making further development significantly easier. Any developer looking to create their own card games would no longer need to reinvent the wheel and could simply pull upon the provided functionality.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis module will provide the core functional interfaces for users to create their own card games in a 3D setting, as well as provide a free to use implementation of the card game Solitaire. Included interfaces include: defining the seat positions of card piles, management of card collections (hands, decks, discards), and real-time movement of cards across the table. These interfaces will be decoupled from the game itself, making them easy to incorporate into other projects.\n\nAll coding resources and source would be released to the community through a github repository, making them available to anyone who would like to deploy the game onto their land or develop their own card game.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI'll be working on this project solo. I've been programming for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). While I've only been developing in DCL for a relatively short period of time I have made good strides and am fully capable of implementing this project in the given time-frame. I've created several projects on the platform (including minesweeper and networked checkers) and I have a good understanding of the development pipe-line.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis project will be completed within 2 weeks of this proposal's acceptance. The basic roadmap is as follows:\n\n*   Week 1: Implementation of core features, rough demo scene made available for feedback.\n\n*   Week 2: Scene/code polish, implementation of suggested features within scope.\n\nAs with any project, there will likely be bugs/flaws in implementation. I'll be maintaining the main repository and will work towards fixing these as they get flagged.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=13e979f0-27dc-11ed-ac99-5bece7edccd0)**",

    "body": "> by 0x017fbadca2dbc267bb046624f23831662a6fd718 (BPVerse)\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAt Butterfly Prawn Farm (BPF), we created a unprecedented Free-To-Play (F2P), Play-to-Earn (P2E) farm game, where players, AKA farmers, harvest plants, collect resources and compete in different monthly events for rewards (wearables).\n\nThe team envisage an improved BPF with new game mechanics, multiple events and more wearables while keeping it F2P, P2E friendly. With more than 1800 users weekly, a continual trending place in Decentraland (DCL) and a fast growing game, we strive to bring farmers more content, better experience and fun!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x017fBaDCA2Dbc267Bb046624F23831662A6Fd718\n\n## Email address\n\nbutterflyprawnfarm@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe Butterfly Prawn Farm (BPF) is a newly founded F2P, P2E farm game. BPF's goal is to boost the community in DCL while giving players a reason to be active. The game allows players, AKA farmers, to harvest crops, collect resources and be rewarded with wearables for their accomplishments. With minimal learning curve, farmers found a reason to log in daily and continue harvesting their crops, making it a daily, social affair for DCL players. Furthermore, BPF continues to host events monthly, rewarding farmers for participating and ascending the leaderboard.\n\nInitially started as a pet project by a single developer, the team quickly expanded into a team of 5 due to high traction and interest from the community. As we progressively improved the game features and mechanics, it requires dedication from the team to ideate and solve complex and challenging problems. The team extensively did pro-bono work for all wearables, events, development, server cost, 3D modelling and design efforts. Therefore, we seek funding from the community, as it would be difficult to continue self-funding and dedicating ourselves to BPF, without the necessary support we hoped for in our expansion plan. The team strongly believes that with the funding and support, BPF will bring more entertainment and value add to the community.\n\nIndividual Experience:\n\n1.  Solutions Architect: Solutions Architect with 12 years of experience in architecting, designing solutions and software development. He specialized in Human Machine Interface while acting as a consultant for various large scale software projects. He handled projects valued at over $30 Million, which he oversees end-to-end development. He also successfully delivered and operationalised software applications.\n\n2.  Business Development Manager: Product Owner with 4 years of experience in software development and product management. His experience includes managing stakeholders requirements, operations & tech integration and system architecting. He successfully delivered software applications of over $20 million and completed multiple Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with deployment and releases.\n\n3.  Lead Full Stack Software Developer #1: Lead Software Developer with 4 years of experience in software development and full SDLC. He oversees software applications, particularly in frontend, backend and deployment. In addition, he actively coached developers on complex technical challenges. He graduated with a Bachelor in Electrical Engineer, First Class Honours.\n\n4.  Lead Full Stack Software Developer #2: Lead Software Developer with 4 years of experience in software development, specializing in front-end development. His experience includes drones development, web and java applications. As a lead, he often front technical discussions while offering professional advice in data structures, algorithm design and complexity analysis.\n\n5.  Ops & Tech Support: A Marine Chief Engineer with over 10 years of sailing and engineering experience, in charge of operating and maintaining multi-million dollar shipping vessels.\n    As a marine engineer and institute of higher education senior lecturer, he spends his time actively imparting knowledge while playing grinding games during down time.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n1.  Overall gameplay and server improvements. Server redundancy, improvements and database backup. Airdrops are scheduled and latency is lowered. User Interface (UI) revamp to improve the overall outlook of the farm. Improvement to facilitate better User Experience (UX). To do this, we design and develop UI while incorporating Design Innovation techniques to improve the overall gameplay. While the team improves the gameplay, we are actively looking to improve the shop functions, UI and UX as well. Farmers will be surprised with a new shop interface that improves their overall experience.\n\n2.  New plants and plant drops. With the development of new plants, farmers can plant different plants to gain in-game currency (BPF coins) and exchange for wearables. Farmers can also look forward to receiving in-game materials from the plants in the near future!\n\n3.  Crafting. With the development of the crafting feature, farmers can expect to combine in-game materials and currency to get wearables and unique in-game items. These wearables and items could provide specific bonuses to events and plants!\n\n4.  New Animals. After achieving funds, our designer and developers will work in tandem to design and develop unique animals for players to enjoy and catch. Farmers can anticipate new animals they have never seen before!\n\n5.  New wearables. These wearables give bonuses in-game, which encourages farmers to farm and acquire them. As we would engage designers, farmers can look forward to wearables of different styles, collections and appearances. Through our funding, we intend to launch multiple wearables every month to boost farmers' experience, goals and gameplay in BPF.\n\n6.  Monthly events and rewards. Apart from the main objective of P2E, our team aims to give back and engage the community regularly by providing a different avenue to participate in the farm. Monthly events will be unique and farmers can experience different gameplay to enhance their experience. Examples are the ‘Climb the Beanstalk’ event to reach the floating cloud platform and ‘Chasing the Animal’ event with a Magic Flute summoning many animals at once! Rewards are given to hardworking farmers who reached the top of the leaderboards. Farmers can purchase wearables in-game (via in-game currency or MANA) when they participate in such events to gain specific boosts to their stats! These events are proprietary ideas that the team had conceptualized to make BPF a more enjoyable game for everyone.\n\n7.  Development of Cloud. For farmers who have reached the floating cloud platform using the beanstalk, there are plans to further develop new and exciting features on the cloud platform. Stay tuned for more!\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe team consists of 5 team members that complement each other in a vast set of skills and experience. Our collaborative experience includes, full-stack software deployment, product design and product management. At the same time, we are actively recruiting for team players with different skill sets to join our family!\n\nExperience aside, we’re a group of game enthusiasts! Even with our full-time jobs, we have been actively developing and deploying new features in BPF frequently, and we aim to serve and attract the DCL community better, through never-seen-before, events, gameplay and wearables!\n\nOur team is committed to delivering the best we can for the DCL community. As we engage our industrial experience, the team partakes in agile development using SCRUM, where we have meetings (daily stand-up and fortnightly sprints) to keep track of development progress and ideate on new ideas.\n\nWe aim to expand the team further with the expertise stated below:\n1 x Solutions Architect\n2 x Full Stack Developer\n1 x Business Development Manager\n1 x 3D Environment Artist\n1 x Social Media Manager\n1 x Ops & Tech Support\n\nFunds breakdown:\nSoftware development: 70k. Of which, backend development will be allocated 35k, while web development will be allocated 35k.\n\nModelling, graphics and design: 20k\n\nOperations, maintenance and social media (Twitter, discord): 25k. This includes social media premium subscriptions, server costs and wearables listing fees.\n\nMarketing: 5k\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nBefore receiving funds:\nThe team developed the baseline for BPF with basic features (harvesting plants and catching of animals). The team developed new mechanisms such as new plant designs and types, additional plots for planting based on a level system, beanstalk, cloud platform, and walking, running and flying animals. The team also launched monthly events such as Climb the Beanstalk and Chasing the Animals. The events include mini-games such as Magic Flute summoning many animals at once. Currently, the team had published 9 wearables with different utilities.\n\nOn maintainability, the team fixed bugs promptly that was transparent and visible to farmers. The team embarked on a support channel in discord, to assign moderators to personally help players with technical difficulties. The functionality of gameplay was also improved via leaderboard and shop upgrades.\n\nReceiving funds:\nRefer to specifications for in-depth breakdown.\n\nOngoing development throughout 6 months:\n\n1.  Overall gameplay and server improvements\n2.  New wearables\n3.  New plants and plant drops\n4.  New animals\n5.  Monthly events and rewards\n\nPhase 1:\n\n1.  Crafting\n\nPhase 2:\n\n1.  Development of Cloud\n\nThe team is accountable to the community. There will be monthly updates via social media platforms and active engagement with the community. Suggestions, bugs reporting and discussions are taken seriously and the team looks to implement practical and favorable ideas.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0c0fbc20-25cb-11ed-ac99-5bece7edccd0)**",

You can find that grant and our report here https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-qmursmt-preparing-detailed-financial-statements-budget-and-long-range-forecast/12514\n\nFollowing our work, we propose the creation of a Strategy & Finance Squad, led by Alastor to take ownership and drive forward a number of important key strategic initiatives for the DAO, including treasury diversification, additional data and analytics transparency, monitoring of MANA valuation, and expense reporting and management. This engagement will last for six months starting in September with the plan to put up a new proposal to extend the engagement next February.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x11cbB078596E5100F4cbB999c5C9b69cA2FF6477\n\n## Email address\n\nsam@alastor.ooo\n\n## Description\n\nOur first priority over the course of the next 1-2 months will be to lead a treasury diversification for Decentraland to ensure that the DAO has adequate stables in its treasury to continue to fund operations in the event of a material decrease in MANA price. This will include: third-party/counterparty reachout, ROI analysis on various options, fleshing out necessary hurdles/details (DAO legal entity organization, etc.), and providing a final recommendation to the community on the right path forward.\n\nOur focus for Q4 will be around improving Decentraland investor relations, beginning by working with the Decentraland team (or engaging a data engineer, if necessary) to make platform performance data more readily available publicly.\n\nWe will also provide two quarterly reports (Q3 2022, released in October and Q4 2022 released in January) on Decentraland’s financial performance, including platform statistics, treasury performance, and expense details.\n\nIn addition to the specific projects above, Alastor will plan to be fully involved in the community as Decentraland’s internal strategic finance team. These ongoing functions and responsibilities will include:\n\n\\-Working cross functionally with the Decentraland team and community to inform the set up and maintenance of accounting and data retention processes to inform community transparency and reporting (this inform the quarterly reports mentioned above)\n\\-Maintaining and evaluating and updating a living business operating model and financial projections to inform and drive strategic decision-making such as expense management, treasury diversification, partnerships, M\\&A, token swaps, and organic growth initiatives\n\\-Leading conversations and negotiations in all strategic and financial transactions that the DAO may engage in (M\\&A, strategic fundraises, token swaps, etc.)\n\\-Monitoring token valuation, particularly in the context of MANA spend, including regular analysis of token trading against comparable protocols as well as intrinsic valuation exercises to determine proper scale and ROI of contributor, rewards, and grants spend as well as any other token-related transactions\n\\-Leading efforts and being the team liaison with the Decentraland community regarding treasury management including yield decision-making, diversification efforts, and risk management\n\\-Perform ad-hoc analysis at the request of the Decentraland team and community to assist in all financial and strategic decision-making\n\nAlastor will plan to provide all resources necessary to accomplish the above tasks, including necessary data subscriptions (Dune, Nansen, Kaiko, etc.) and any third-party contracting\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAll of our work will be done using a combination of on-chain data analytics tools (Dune, Nansen, Etherscane, etc.) and Microsoft Office. To the extent we require additional third-party data engineering we will plan to engage them ourselves and pay for any work out of the Alastor budget.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nSam Bronstein: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-bronstein-683b1350/\nJordan Stastny: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-stastny-78160461/\n\nAlastor was founded at the beginning of 2022 to provide strategic and financial services to DAOs.

Letting preconceived ideas about why web3 is bad block their ability to utilize these technologies, people that could benefit from them the most do not. One example is artists. Without having somebody to talk with artists about the technology and facilitate them embracing this technology, artists are not able to be benefitted from it.\nFor many artists, creating new NFTs, as well as attracting and maintaining communities that believe in their project is an issue. In Christchurch, New Zealand there is a community of artists (tied to a physical location XCHC) creating a movement in real life through creative events and facilitating spaces in a way that enables community and culture to thrive. However, this community has only started to embrace web3. As a fairly young and small country, the culture has room to improve with their standard of entertainment, nightlife, and creative options in Christchurch and the wider New Zealand. This ultimately leaves many dissatisfied, feeling it lacks the creativity and diversity found in other cities. Without alternatives, the local scene is left with an unhealthy and at times unsafe binge drinking culture, repetitive entertainment, and a socially reserved reputation. Christchurch is especially known for being largely consertive, “closing early”, clique art world, and most “music venues' ' are just bars profiteering off music, leaving most alternative/original music overlooked. Though the XCHC  has been doing great work with artists for 7+ years, this community remains a bit hidden from the wider world (as we’re sure most alternative/independant art spaces can relate). Artists here remain disconnected from the global reach and possibilities enabled by embracing web3 technology, such as NFTs, tokens, and DAOs. However, some are ready to take the next step.\nOnce people embrace web3, initially it’s often for personal gain and not for public good. Without utilizing this technology for public good, people are unable to see the huge benefits for the world that can come from web3. By embracing web3 through an artistic community and ensuring that the community is guided by doing public good, we can create a more positive narrative than is currently portrayed in many media outlets.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThese funds will be used as a stepping stone to make New Zealand a global destination for creatives pushing the edges of culture and creative experiences in a way that harmonizes with the whenua (land) and a more sustainable future. Along with that, it will be used to onboard artists into web3 and create a documented onboarding process. As appropriate, existing DAO management tools will be incorporated into this process. When gaps in tooling are discovered, these components will be highlighted and the need expressed to create these tools. For the next Mary Hush and other in real life events, we expect to channel some of this funding to them to facilitate them stepping into new realms of creativity. In order to do this the core team needs to be compensated for the active 'on the ground' development, enabling others to expand into the digital space. Along with that the expansion of the advisory team and formalizing the process towards decentralization will be done. A large portion of the funding will go towards enabling a large number of artists to step into the web3 space and to get a large number of original works from across New Zealand. The XCHC will open a content creators studio to serve 2 purposes: Report and record the progress our members are making into the web3 space and to inspire others to join our community. As well as to start the production of a documentary; similar to the Meow Wolf doco.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nT.R. Price |  Web3 Leader\nFor the past year and a half T.R. has worked exclusively on regenerative finance and building this movement. From that they have had the opportunity to speak alongside organizations like Giveth, Charged Particles and NFTP in the world’s biggest cryptocurrency conference, EthDenver. During that time, they helped many organizations to adopt web3 principles and created various DAOs. Including Return to Green, which has successfully ran the first metaverse event in collaboration with XCHC.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nNow- December 10th: NFT crowdfunding for metaverse space, and exploring how Mary Hush can work with web3, digitizing art $150,000\nDecember 10th: Second opening of metaverse land featuring some art of the Mary Hush event as well as streaming music from the event into the Mary Hush metaverse $50,000\nDecember 10th 2022- June 2023: Experiment in DAO tooling for the IRL community, send grant funding to artists to onboard more art into the web3 space. Document process. $300,000\nJune 2023: Launch an immersive collaborative art space (next iteration of XHC) and expand reach of organization to support more in real life artists as well as web3 techonology. $1,000,000\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=37c29390-2447-11ed-b4a9-178eb7bc02f5)**",

    "title": "An Immersive In-World Marketplace Proposal",
    "body": "> by 0xc3e3d13d98b84e1808c4145355c0cade20a2fc98 (LastSlice)\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAt the highest level, the intent of the marketplace is to “virtualize” all of the Decentraland dApps and integrate them into the virtual world. Our team believes that a truly immersive experience begins by keeping as much of the Decentraland experience in-world as possible, including native DAO and Marketplace features, without requiring you to leave your Decentraland browser tab or client experience. Our goal is to have 100% of the market.decentraland.org functionality inside Decentraland and available freely to everyone, as well as to create a community hub for socialization and trade.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x5F2ABE4d5313D6818e1eecEF8cCD172217e07e05\n\n## Email address\n\ninfo@lastslice.org\n\n## Description\n\nUpon spawning into Decentraland, you find that a mysterious envelope has appeared in your inventory. You examine its exterior and notice a gold-tinged seal with a coin-shaped sigil embossed into it. Suddenly, the seal springs open and grains of sand fly out in a flurry around you. Moments later, after you’ve regained your senses, you realize that you’re in a completely new area of the world – somewhere massive, surreal, sandy, and bustling with life.\n\n“Welcome, human, to the marketplace,” a peculiar voice calls from an alley behind you, “I see you received my letter. Come, this way...” they say as their wrinkly, bejeweled finger beckons you to follow.\n\n**Description**\n\nFull doc -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/10gLDguQpjONSHXQZe6\\_aO9DopUoWXMC3e4Jp4xzYAi8/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThe marketplace at its core will address three common-sense problems that have yet to be implemented into the Decentraland experience: trying on and purchasing Marketplace items as a User, showcasing created items to sell in Storefronts as a Creator, and participating in the DAO as a Voter. The Decentraland Foundation is hard at work on many areas for the platform, so it’s time the community steps up to help build out this much-desired in-game functionality.\n\nThe DCL platform has been around since 2018, yet we still purchase in-game items (clothing, land, names, nfts) and vote for change through our browsers rather than inside the world of Decentraland. The marketplace aims to provide an improved experience to users by offering a free way to purchase and sell items in-game without ever having to leave the game world or pull up a second window.\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation has put a lot of effort into creating such an amazing platform for us all to meet, create, and explore. However, they must also rely on the community for innovation given the scale of the world. Our proposal aims to take some burden off the Foundation by building out these in-game purchasing experiences while also building amazing immersive content for the entire community. Being transparent, yes, it is already possible to sell wearables on your land in Decentraland. However, doing so remains a technical feat for most that requires an advanced skill set as well as land to deploy to. Doing so also lacks cohesion across a broader Marketplace vision that the marketplace seeks to accomplish through its initial Phase I deliverables.\n\nIn addition to the core functionality of the marketplace, our proposal touches on two gamification points: content creation and user retention. Through quests, storylines, factions, level progression, secret unveilings, in-game rewards, event spaces, and additional core activations such as future minigame(s), the marketplace will provide Decentraland users with engaging content that continues to evolve in complexity over time.\n\nThe marketplace is proposed to be 20x20 parcels (400 total) in size, which is the same scale as Genesis Plaza — that’s 1,102,223 square feet, 25.3 acres, or just over 19 football fields. The proposed location of the marketplace will be one of the two existing duplicate Plazas within Decentraland. Having a duplicate plaza is a redundant use of 400 parcels and there is currently no dedicated team at the Foundation to support the ongoing development of Genesis Plaza or its periphery.\n\nThis proposal, along with our proven team of dedicated creators, plan to transform this duplicate plaza into the marketplace vision laid before you.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Phase 1 Deliverables**\n\n**The Oasis Central Hub**\n\nThe Oasis Central Hub, currently dubbed simply the Hub or Oasis, will be the primary entrypoint for anyone teleporting to the marketplace and is located at the absolute center of the plaza. It will be the largest piece of open air architecture and will act as the center for all marketplace-related content. Think of main online areas from Ralph Breaks the Internet and Ready Player One, or perhaps even RuneScape’s Grand Exchange for reference:\n\nAside from being a social center, the Hub will provide multiple “Info Desks” where Users will be able to obtain area information, see new item releases, and virtually search for wearables to discover, try on, and purchase from the Marketplace. Another part of the Hub will be the “Quest Desk” which will be touched on later. There will also be open gathering spaces for players to hang out, socialize, discuss trades/quests/etc. Additional planned interactivity includes various NPCs, custom signage, possible ‘secret’ quests, and a live visual $MANA feed to name a few.\n\n**The Marketplace Fields & Storefronts**\n\nThe marketplace fields will be organized into 4 quadrants around the Oasis Hub that will be populated with virtual Storefronts for all Creators. At the time of initial launch, 2 of the fields will be publicly open with the other 2 fields reserved for future expansion. Storefronts will initially focus on displaying primary sale products, but we plan to support secondary sale displays at a later date.\n\nEach field is huge – think of a massive flea market that looks like Dune meets Star Wars, or the RPO Columbus Stacks meets a Middle Eastern Marketplace type-of-feel). Each marketplace Field will have a unique look and feel while still blending with the surrounding context of the plaza. Here is our current reference imagery for the field vision:\n\nStorefronts will be free. To be eligible for a Storefront, the associated Creator wallet address must have at least one creation published on the Marketplace for a minimum of 30 days, however this logic is subject to change based on community feedback. As more collections are introduced, more Storefronts will be dynamically added to the ever-expanding Marketplace Fields stacks. Over time, this will create an evolving form of dynamic architecture. Here’s our initial proof of concept that is still in development with a lot of room for expansion:\n\nStorefronts will be modular in design and Marketplace Creators will have the ability to choose from various visual layouts and styles. Marketplace visitors will be able to walk between each Storefront to discover new creators, collections, and explore what else the Marketplace Fields will offer. Our current implementation for each Storefront takes advantage of openly-available data via The Graph to verify all Creator wallets.\n\n**Quests & Beyond**\n\nSpeaking of additional content, aside from the core goals of the Marketplace, we also have numerous immersive experiences planned that we believe will bring Users back again and again to streamline ongoing engagement and a sense of progress (similar to other P2E games in Decentraland, however, this will not be a P2E game). There will be reward and leveling systems to incentivize further engagement within the Marketplace that will go hand in hand with quests:\n\nFor Phase I, there are 4 public quests planned:\nPlease read the Google Doc for the full breakdown (can't fit it here!)\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nTogether, the Last Slice development team has successfully executed large-scale builds in collaboration with incredible AAA-brands such as Samsung, Playboy, and Snapple. At our team’s core we love creating and solving problems, so this project is all about getting back to our community roots and innovating for everyone’s benefit, not just a brand.\n\n**3D**\n\nArchonomous - Design Lead\n\nBlacknode\n\nCyclopa\n\nKirzoz\n\nMeshroom\n\nNaz\n\nPaladin\n\nSango\n\nTrifox\n\nTimenotspace\n\n**Programming**\n\nLastraum\n\nUnknower\n\nDogman\n\nMurpheus\n\n**Scene Audio**\n\nRaja The Tiger\nUnknower\n\nKirzoz\n\nPaladin\n\nNFT Authr\n\n**Voice Audio**\n\nMurpheus\n\nKirzoz\n\nUnknower\n\nTengu\n\nYouMack\n\nMease\n\n**Proposal Design**\n\nLastraum\n\nArchonomous\n\nAndyNFT\n\nTengu\n\n**Social Media**\n\nAndyNFT\n\nYouMack\n\nNicole Nixon\n\nMaryana\n\nTobik\n\n**Project Management**\n\nYouMack\n\nMaryana\n\nNicole Nixon\n\n**Discord Support**\n\nAndyNFT\n\nUnknower\n\nYouMack\n\nMaryana\n\n**Video Edition/Promotion**\n\nTrifox\n\nTobik\n\nMaryana\n\n**Conceptual Design**\n\nNicole\n\nArchonomous\n\nNaz\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nProjects of this scope have many parallel horizontal paths of development, and estimating precise milestones has proven cumbersome on past projects, especially when discovery is part of the process. However, Last Slice has never failed to deliver on-time and over-expectation, and we intend to maintain that track record.\n\nWith that said, we have every intention to be as transparent as possible throughout the development process. We plan to have a public Discord server for the scene setup, as well as to have it be monitored by familiar community members. We plan to have weekly live sessions with our builders behind the scenes and voice chats of our modeling and building progression. We as a group will regularly communicate our status through social channels like Twitter and Instagram, and are open to receiving input from the community at any point along the way. Progress and updates will be officially documented moving forward to display the history and growth of the Marketplace. This will allow for the community to follow along and stay in touch with the new developments on the build. Those of us at Last Slice find this to be crucial given that open community dialogue is a driving force inherent to Web3.\n\n**Budget Breakdown**\n\n3D Design & Modeling - 40% or $96,000\n\nProgramming - 40% or $96,000\n\nAudio Programming - 5% or $12,000\n\nQuest Team - 8% or $19,200\n\nSoft Skills - 7% or $16,800\n\n\\*Soft skills includes discord, social media, video editing, proposal design, PM\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0f9a4300-23c9-11ed-b4a9-178eb7bc02f5)**",

    "body": "> by 0xffac7fd045303112fdb28e9dace8e1334ad324c0 (eordano)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Custome Spawn Locations](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7c50f0f0-0508-11ed-8a2f-a1a061d4350b)\n\n## Summary\n\nInstead of spawning only in genesis plaza, add a feature to spawn where you desire to.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\n@SirDropBear and a lot of community members would like to spawn in different locations besides genesis plaza. I think it would be great to be able to spawn at any place on the map.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAlways spawning in genesis plaza can get rather boring and sometimes it would be nice to be able to spawn elsewhere. I imagine having a house on a parcel and being able to spawn there when I load the client so it feels you load into your home within Decentraland. Or even spawn at a favorite location.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nIf this proposal passes, the Foundation should implement a new setting on the Decentraland reference client. Such a setting would be called \"Default Spawn Location\" and it would allow the user to appear:\n\n*   On Genesis Plaza (the current default)\n*   On a custom location (which the user can decide)\n*   On the last position where the user closed the client (which doesn't sync across different browsers/clients)\n\nSee \"Implementation pathways\" below for more details.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nBest case scenario, you can set a location to where you will spawn in. Instead of Genesis plaza.\n\nMid case Scenario: Being able to spawn at the location you logged off or last visited.\n\nSo many of the community love grinding various games and would love to spawn there.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe reference client should have a new Setting, called \"Default Spawn Position\" with three options:\n\n*   Genesis Plaza (0,0)\n*   Last Position\n*   Custom Position\n\nIf the third option is selected, then an input is enabled that allows the user to select one fixed position for their client to start.\nThe second option *does not* require the last position to be synced across different browsers/clients (it should be treated as a local setting, such as the sound volume)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is a low-hanging fruit that would make many members of the community happy!\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ca063f30-237b-11ed-b4a9-178eb7bc02f5)**",

Our team has over 20+ years hosting comedy festivals and producing shows with top-tier comedy talent from across North America. We have developed a strong network of comedians, comedy clubs, recording labels, studios, and live IRL venues to attract talent in to DCL and proven we can do it.\n\nOur team:\n\nTyler Morrison - 20 years of stand-up comedy and performance/production to the organization. Access to premier international talent having produced over 100 comedians and is a two-time Juno nominated producer and social media rainmaker and co-owner of Cottage Comedy.\n\nJade Sebek – First and foremost a massive comedy fan!

Our aggressive marketing strategy begins.  Creating the Decentraland booth/experience for Skankfest in Vegas.\n\nMonth 2: Attendance at Skankfest, full promotion of DCL and Decentral Comedy in full effect.  Onboarding of comics + Fans = New users. Exclusive content to be created and filmed at Skankfest for DCL.\n\nMonth 3: DC  following up and onboarding comics directly into the new world.  Creating a database of comedy content which other venues will be able to use (as we already provide comedy content to other spaces in the world regularly).  Taking all the raw footage shot at the festival, editing, and producing it into a best of the fest experience that we will be promoting to fans to attend.\n\nMonth 4: The Skankfest DCL Experience launches in Early November 2022 in our Decentral Comedy Club.  Continue to follow up and onboard new comics and fans.\n\nMonth 5: Continue to follow up and onboard new comics and fans.\n\nMonth 6: Onboard new comics and fans. Full report to the DAO on new users were introduced to DCL through this promotion = comics were onboarded + how many fans from the festival itself (which we will track through a metamask promo at the festival) + how many fans (NEW USERS) directly came into the world to see their favorite comic – still working on a way to track this with DCL itself.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=56e0a3b0-2303-11ed-b4a9-178eb7bc02f5)**",

    "body": "> by 0x65813baedfd68029af5382672b0e4dd2e6f27952 (mattimus)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nEver have trouble finding the exact wearable you were looking for? Have you ever wanted to save an entire outfit for easier changing? Wouldn’t it be nice if you could search for an item by name, find it, and then wear it?\n\nTake a step inside your Decentraland closet! A more advanced backpack, accessible in an external web application.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n25,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x65813BaeDfD68029af5382672b0e4Dd2E6f27952\n\n## Email address\n\nseedeventsdcl@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nI seek to create a web application that will enable advanced backpack features to simplify and enhance the backpack experience and also reduce the need for backpack features inside of the current clients.  Many of the features proposed by the community can be achieved including outfit saving, sorting and filtering, previewing multiple marketplace wearables at once and more.\n\nWhy not create this as an addition to the current backpack?  My main concern when designing this was that any additions to the current backpack would still run into existing issues with the backpack loading slow and not loading in high traffic scenes and at seemingly random times.\n\nThe goal of this project is twofold: add additional features but also ease some frustration with the existing backpack reliability. I also like the idea that someone looking to build a new client can potentially leverage the closet app for their backpack functionality instead of building their own and can focus on the core client functionality.  In addition, the majority of the new features require some external service to be built, to save outfits etc., which can be integrated faster and easier into the current backpack after they are built.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe project will consist of a single “front-end” web application, created using next.js, and a server application and database to store outfits and any user related content. Additionally, existing decentraland foundation services (lambdas + catalyst apis) are used to fetch avatar and wearable data.\n\nThe services will most likely be hosted in AWS, but I will explore other options that can reduce costs so this can be hosted long term.  The final product will have any necessary production-ready features such as data security and encryption, potential use of CDN if loading times are an issue outside of the US, and potentially at least 2 server applications running for failover/redundancy if the need arises.\n\nThe first phase of the project will be focused on the main UI/UX features and the second phase includes integration with the catalyst endpoints to sync outfit changes in game.  In addition to the core features, I hope to add social features, such as seeing other people’s closets and being able to try on other’s saved outfits.\n\nThe goal is to increase user activity and socialization around wearable collections and stimulate more traffic to the marketplace by providing easy navigation for any items they are seeing.\n\nAfter completion, the project source code will be made public so everyone can benefit from the catalyst api avatar interactions, in an attempt to create an ecosystem of many clients, as well as examples of interacting with the dcl lambdas and nft apis.\n\nI have hosted an initial version to demonstrate feasibility, explore the data available and show the basic trying on features: [DCL Closet Prototype](https://dcl-closet.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)\n\nTo use the app, paste in your wallet address under \"Avatar Address\" and your current avatar and backpack will load.  To preview your avatar with someone else's backpack, you can paste a different address into \"Backpack Address\"\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI am a full stack senior software engineer of over 10 years by profession and have all of the skills required to execute. I have contributed sdk development in several large community events as well as have my own parcel that I actively develop and visit daily. I have 2 publicly available sdk scripts and am always looking for ways to assist other devs and the community.\n\nI am also very familiar with the existing data and apis for interacting with user wearables. For the MVFW Summer Gala I created a wearable viewing feature that allowed users to see what any avatar was currently wearing in a ui menu, with direct links to the marketplace listing.\n\nI also seek to hire someone to create UX wireframes to assist with the outfit saving flows and sorting and filtering functionality as well as a UI designer to make the application feel fully polished visually\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Phase 1 features**\n\n*   UI/UX basic design and features\n*   User feedback gathering and feature suggestions\n*   Filtering and Sorting closet by\n    *   body part type\n    *   Rarity\n    *   Quantity\n    *   Name\n*   Outfit saving\n*   Marketplace links\n*   Wallet connect\n    *   Metamask\n*   Web hosting setup\n\nTotal estimated time: 80 hours\n\n**Phase 1 extra features**\n\n*   Sharing outfits\n*   Sharing closets\n*   Triggering emotes in preview\n*   Background color selection in preview\n*   Background image color representing rarity\n\nTotal estimated time:  30 hours\n\n**Phase 2 Features**\n\n*   Base avatar wearables, import all base models and be able to change them in outfit\n*   Outfit Saving Enhancements, more outfit slots, ux updates after user feedback from phase 1 implementation\n*   Enhanced validation to filter wearables by model types and enforce validation before catalyst updates\n*   Integration with catalyst api to sync outfit in game\n*   Wallet connect\n    *   Add more supported wallets to match all available in dcl\n\nTotal estimated time: 80 hours\n\nTotal Project Estimated 190 hours\n\nDev budget 22k\n\nDesign budget 2k\n\nHosting fees 1k\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=42cc9f20-2239-11ed-b4a9-178eb7bc02f5)**",

Decentraland Names in their current form do not allow for alternative languages such as Arabic, Mandarin, Hindi etc. The current restrictions are ; they may not exceed 15 characters, contain spaces, or include any non-alphanumeric characters. If Decentraland is to be adopted, inclusivity of all languages seems logical.\n\n(Decentraland Names leverage ENS as Subdomains of parent domain, dcl.eth.

In addition, sellers will be able to see what their forecasted reach would be from their chosen budget. Plus, sellers will receive demand analytics for advertising results.\n\nLOYALTY POINTS PROGRAMME (LLP) - to reward users for spending MANA, gaining points that can be redeemed or offset to future transactions.\nOur mission is to encourage the community to reinvest, contributing to growth in the Decentraland economy.\n\nOur partners, RAFT, have been operating for 10+ years, taking on over 600+ projects and well-adapt to the ETH blockchain.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n73,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4c41c164d7b601d8809643767aca6ce1ed31a2d6\n\n## Email address\n\naaavisionsltd@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nProviding Advertising Space Facilities and Loyalty Points schemes are proven to encourage engagement in marketplaces, social platforms and all.\n\nAD Boosters will discover items in a high supply economy boosting high and low-exposure items:\n\nFACT - According to ‘OnlineSales.ai’, “Introducing merchant-funded product listing ads can give a boost (to the Bottomline of the marketplace) of more than 50% of the revenue generated through GMV (Gross Merchandise Value). It significantly strengthens the revenue model of a marketplace.”\n\nLoyalty Programme:\n\nFACT:-\n\n*   According to FORBES, “78% of consumers are more likely to buy from a brand with a loyalty program.”\n*   According to FinExtra, “71% of consumers say loyalty rewards programs are a meaningful part of their brand relationship.”\n\nSelling wearables – Noticeably, a large supply of wearables enters the marketplace daily, giving sellers less time on the ‘Newest Items’ list and at the top of the item category page.\n\nThe grant will fund version 1.0, the initial instalment to AD BOOSTER & LLP. We anticipate that there will be further updates & added features required, post the project going LIVE from internal & external sources. Internally, being analysing user activity and externally, being user feedback.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPlease see the link with our Project Spec - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-kmXqRyEXOtGkVwBqiiB2XCEuohSVNfPAav-8XimP6E/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nRaft - https://raftds.com/ - A team of Software Engineers & Developers.\n\nDirector Of Engineering at Raft - Evgeniy Kokuykin -https://www.linkedin.com/in/evgeniykokuykin/?originalSubdomain=ru\n\nSoftware Engineering Manager at Raft - Vitaliy Shvetsov - https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitaliy-s-73297764/\n\nProjects:-\n\nGreen Projects Marketplace:\n\nOur engineering team have participated in Blockchain tech-related projects. One of them was a marketplace for Green projects investing. In that project, funding has been transferred from Buyer to Supplier via smart contract on the Ethereum platform. Large Global Technology lead this project to improve efficiency for new Green technology startups. Frontend and backend squads from Raft with ten engineers focused on building web applications and supporting the product launch.\n\nBlockchain Network for Cloud Services Provider:\n\nAnother project related to Ethereum was implementing an on-demand blockchain network for a Major Cloud Services provider. Raft engineers have designed and coded VS Code extension for Cloud Blockchain services and added Truffle and Solidity integrations within that extension.

    "body": "> by 0x09bc69a986e1b37fb01ef36124f4c2e14fa0ab6b (BillyTeacoin)\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nI would like to see more music and sound content in Decentraland to help create a more immersive environment for us all in Decentraland. Most of the community who are building in the space are 3D design artists and coders, not sound artists. Much like how there are free 3D assets for the DCL builder to drag and drop into a build, I believe that a mini library of stock music and sounds should also be open to all in Decentraland to use. I wish to create this for everyone in DCL to use in their builds.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n4,569 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x09bc69A986e1b37fB01EF36124f4c2E14fA0ab6B\n\n## Email address\n\nbillyteacoin@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nI have noticed when loading into many parcels in Decentraland that it is quite often lacking sound.\nI think without sound a lot of Decentraland is lacking that immersive experience that a complete audiovisual package can give you. If you think about watching a video, sound is 50% of the experience (in my opinion it can be even up to 69% of the experience)! The same I think can be said for games and in interactive virtual world experiences (like Decentraland).\n\nI propose to create a series of sound clips that anyone building in Decentraland can use for absolutely free on their parcel (with a copyright notice/license agreement stating that these sound clips may only be used within Decentraland).\n\nMany games within Decentraland could freely use these music compositions or ambience tracks to help with that sonic void in their build. For example, games such as: Wondermine, Exodus, Butterfly Prawn, Golfcraft and more if they don’t yet have any music.\nSome of the plazas seem to be lacking sound including: Forest Plaza, Vegas Plaza and Medieval Plaza. These places feel rather dead to me when entering as there is nothing much to be heard.\n\nThe music as you enter Decentraland in Genesis Plaza is a great example of a parcel that effectively includes sound/music.\nSome other plazas like Soho Plaza, Asian Plaza and Gamer Plaza include background soundscapes which help immerse the player in the build.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nScope of delivery:\n6 to 9 field recordings for natural ambient tracks (captured on pro location audio recording equipment)\n6 to 9 music compositions of various styles (composed on a Digital Audio Workstation)\n6 to 9 electronic/synth ambient tracks (sound designed on a Digital Audio Workstation)\nA small collection of sound effects/foley for basic object interactions (doors opening and chests opening etc)\nThe plan will be to host these audio clips on a basic website/hosting service which I will set up myself with help from other community members who have offered me assistance.\nOne idea might be to create an “npm package”, have the audio files selectable by the owner/operator who can then stream the audio files to their build with just using some code in the SDK.\nI will likely host the audio clips as ogg vorbis as this is a great codec for high quality in a small file size format. However I will consult builders in the community to help me decide on optimization of the files for playback in Decentraland builds so things work smoothly.\n\nThese will all be freely available for anyone to use in Decentraland. If anyone wants something unique to their own build then they can hire me (or someone else) of their own accord to create something for them. But this Decentraland public mini library of audio clips will give anyone something to start off with and help give Decentraland some more sound to immerse ourselves in-world.\n\nBreakdown of expected costs in Australian Dollars (AUD):\nSound libraries to create a vast array of professional sounding music scores:\nChoral sounds $300\nSymphony orchestra sounds $540\nLarge library bundle of soft synths and sounds $1800\nAction/blockbuster film strings library $450\n\nSalary of 69 hours x $43 hourly rate (work spread over 2 to 3 months) = $2,967\nSalary given is based on Average Base Salary for a Music Composer in Australia and estimated roughly 2 weeks of work if worked on full time. Source: https://www.salaryexpert.com/salary/job/music-composer/australia\n\nFile hosting: approx $600 to host files/website for at least 3 years\n\nTotal expected cost: $6,657 AUD = $4,569 USD\n\nEquipment already provided by myself, therefore not required by the grant:\nDigital Audio Workstation (including computer and DAW software)\nMicrophones and professional location recording equipment\nMusical keyboard, mixers, studio monitor speakers and headphones etc.\n\nAt the completion of the core part of the project I will continue to maintain the free audio clip library for DCL and at my own discretion voluntarily add to it in my own time if I am able.\nI do not directly intend to create another grant proposal for this project specifically into the future and I wish to seek outside funding or community donations (or out of my own pocket if necessary) to keep the files hosted after the grant funds have run out for approx 3 years of hosting.\nIf there is any significant demand from the Decentraland community however, there may be a consideration to hire me and/or other sound artists in the community (via another grant) to significantly expand upon this free audio clip library, as the community sees fit.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nBillyTeacoin – past experience as a sound designer, composer and music scorer from Melbourne, Australia.\nQualifications: Diploma of Audiovisual technology, freelance audio professional experience\n\nExamples of past work:\nMelbourne Zoo sound installation, campaign about environmental damage of balloons\nhttps://vimeo.com/539567262\n\nChiptune/8-bit music score for a video game jam\nhttps://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2022/rate/1503149\n\nNature soundscape for an NFT “Awed Love Tree”\nhttps://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/4403712139229828665333678861990415974606447873516676776834712453310362681345\n\nApart from that, I am quite an active member in the Decentraland community and wish to improve the enjoyment of experiences within Decentraland for existing members and new. That’s why I’d like to bring my skills in sound to enhance the content in the space.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMonth 1 – gather as many field recordings as possible to create a collection of natural ambience soundscapes (nature sounds, city sounds, café background sounds etc). Initially I will make these publicly available on a Google Drive account so I can show others in the community previews of the work for me to receive feedback.\n\nWith the funding, all required sound library packs needed to compose the music etc will be purchased.\n\nA web hosting service for storing the audio clips will start to be set up and paid for.\n\nMonth 2 – composing the collection of music scores. Upload these to Google Drive for feedback from the community.\n\nTrial testing of audio clips as npm packages and testing in DCL builds using SDK.\n\nMonth 3 – compose/sound design electronic ambience tracks (for sci-fi and general non-natural ambience). Record and prepare a small collection of sound effects and foley sounds.\nUpload the remaining work to Google Drive and approach builders in the community to make them aware of these free sounds and music scores and ask them to test them and give feedback.\n\nI will update and consult the community on progress as I go via Discord, most predominantly the Community Building Decentraland Discord server.\nI will also post major announcements/updates to social media, mainly Twitter as this is where most of the Decentraland/Web3 community resides social media wise.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1c31fb10-2119-11ed-b4a9-178eb7bc02f5)**",

However, there are other practices not yet defined in the terms and conditions which have raised concerns. We’d like to open up the discussion and ask the community to make sure we guarantee an efficient use of the community treasury, with your input.\n\n### Some  concerns raised so far include:\n\n*   When it is impossible for us to have real contact with the Grantee during the 30 days after the grant request was approved by the DAO.\n\n*   When the Grantee doesn’t make the official update on the proposal page.\n\n*   When Grantees are reluctant to interact with the community (no discord participation, no updates, no response in any channel of communication).\n\n*   When the use of the budget and the project have inconsistencies.\n\n*   When it’s not clear who is managing the funds.\n\n*   When there’s suspicion of a grantee taking advantage of the intellectual property of a third party.\n\n*   When the project is not making progress or the deliverables don’t match the allocated budget.\n\n*   When fellow community members raise concerns (publicly or privately) of misuse of grant funds or poor ethics.\n\n*   When the project is already getting financial support from the Decentraland Foundation.\n\n*   When the grantee has not released the funds vested after 2 months the vesting contract was enacted.\n\n### POLL: Decide the best procedure to revoke a grant?\n\n*   **Community Decides:**  Present each case with our arguments and recommendations to the Community and ask if the Grant should be revoked.\n\n*   **DAO committee decides:** Present each case with our arguments and recommendations for the DAO Committee to decide if the grant should be revoked.\n\n*   **New committee decides:** Present each case with our arguments and recommendations and assign the responsibility to decide to a NEW Committee which specifically addresses these matters.\n\n*   **Do nothing.**\n\nWe’d love to hear your opinion regarding the decision making on these types of concerns.

Hosting a Decentraland DAO sponsored side event would be a great opportunity for us to promote and bring more awareness to what the DAO has been doing to a very receptive community of web3 enthusiasts.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x8b7c37671f37Db95e9d84714f7A4464d552aa0EA\n\n## Email address\n\nfractilians@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nThere is nothing quite like an IRL event full of degen crypto-loving peeps to get creative ideas rolling. We feel it’s important for Decentraland to have more presence at IRL events to help encourage, educate and connect with builders and devs from across a wide range of communities. It’s a great way to attract new contributing members to our community,\nshowcase the pioneering progress of Decentraland DAO and its contributors, and get together to enjoy some good moments.\n\nWe are currently working with MCON conference organizers to secure a partnership with a larger event at the conference. Once we confirm the venue we will be sharing it here with the community. (Due to the condensed time frame we will be updating in the Discord channel and the forum as well)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nGOALS\n\nWe firmly believe that it is  beneficial for Decentraland DAO to be involved in events + IRL conversations about the potential of the metaverse, specifically open-source and decentralized projects. Decentraland DAO is a leader in the space and has one of the largest treasuries in terms of assets under management, however, because of the distributed nature of our operations, we do not have a significant IRL event presence. This event is the perfect opportunity to engage in such conversations with the community attending and increase the visibility of our DAO and its contributors.

It's an extended wrapper class around .glbs/gltf that can add additional complexity like jiggle bones, expressions and VR player mapping.\n\n### How\n\nDecentraland's human skeleton model is an exact match to the VRM-humanoid model, making this process feasible. We would not need to add jiggle bones or expressions, they are optional; The VR player mapping can be done in the .glb -> .vrm conversion thanks to this already matching bone structure. A unity plugin, uniVRM, does this automatically already - we would need to implement this functionality in a pipeline that can automate this process.\n\n### Why\n\nAn API that can export the .vrm of a player would be incredibly useful, not only for the upcoming VR Client, but also for interoperability with all VR and non-VR games. The .vrm model is easily imported to external games, allowing our avatars to travel 'across the metaverse' without custom implementations and rigging.\n\nThis API should be locked so you can only export your current character, ensuring that you can only bring your current avatar into other games. This process would require an eth sign on API request to ensure the user has ownership, enabling DCL to remain in control of the ownership and creator rights.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, I think this would be a powerful step forward for interoperability as well as avatar/wearable ownership, enabling a 'one-click' button to import DCL characters into other games. I already use my 'morphbot' avatar on both twitch and VRChat thanks to this process, but an automated API would unlock this for all users and developers.\n\nKeen to hear thoughts and would love to hear the VR team's feedback on whether this is being explored currently, the M3 org has also expressed interest in this, as it would enable import of DCL avatars to the webaverse's upcoming MMO.\n\n- Implement an API that can generate, cache, and export a user's current model as .vrm\n- Do not implement, not useful\n- Unsure of feasibility to run and maintain\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bdafe1c0-1d6b-11ed-96c7-2fa07c6df25b)**",

    "body": "> by 0xf2f58ed9ab3057838d88d06be8269270cdc8aa89 (menduz)\n\nHello I am Mendez, and I've been a core contributor of Decentraland since Jan 2018. This is my first governance proposal ever since.\n\nSeveral people have brought this problem to my attention and I acknowledge this as a vulnerability that needs to be addressed before it starts affecting people and their digital lives.\n\nIn Decentraland, users’ addresses represent more than a transaction parameter in a blockchain, they are part of a user’s digital identity, and exposing this information along with real-time position data could lead to a form of digital surveillance that could be damaging to users and to Decentraland itself.\n\nCatalyst communications server exposes an API endpoint that responds with user addresses and their exact locations at every moment, facilitating hostile actors to harass platform users. This API could also enable the creation of hate bots that could target specific users or types of audiences. This type of information should be treated as sensitive to prevent these types of scenarios. The endpoints to be removed are:\n\n*   https://peer.decentraland.org/comms/peers\n*   https://peer.decentraland.org/comms/islands\n\nThese endpoints are not needed in order for Decentraland to work. In fact, they were originally intended for manual debugging purposes only.\n\nHowever, by removing the endpoints in question, there is also a drawback: this API is used to know if a user is in a specific location at the time of making a request. In some scenes, this feature is used by some anti-bot mechanisms. To that extent, a new API endpoint is proposed to validate if a user is in a specific position on a case-by-case basis instead of tracking all the users all the time. For analytics/statistical information of islands, new privacy-aware endpoints were already created [/stats/parcels](https://peer.decentraland.org/stats/parcels)\n\nSummary of the proposed changes:\n\n*   Remove the `/comms/peers` and `/comms/islands` endpoints. Use `/stats/parcels` instead\n*   Create a new endpoint to validate if a user holding the specified address is in the specified position\n\n- Remove the endpoints\n- Keep the endpoints\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=32ab78a0-1cda-11ed-96c7-2fa07c6df25b)**",

We plan to offer reasonable land lease options for big and small companies and creators and shared event space for any tenant to use.\n\nWe commissioned an award-winning architect to create a wonderful design concept for the district. We have a strategic relationship with Parcel, a renowned metaverse real estate marketplace, to help present the district to major brands. LEDY Inc. an experienced metaverse real estate developer will design and build shared spaces within the district.\n\nWith a DAO grant, we can pay skilled modelers and developers to build a minimum viable version of the district, and create the brand awareness needed to attract new companies and creators to Decentraland.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2F1a5C8523839c2d0692f7C89116fb067B77A532\n\n## Email address\n\ncontact@nexusmarket.io\n\n## Description\n\nNexus Market District was formed in 2018 as the Central Marketplace. The district has 279 parcels thanks to MANA donations from 61 contributors. Since then, lack of capital has been a big hurdle for Nexus to deliver on its vision. Efforts to get 3d modelers and programmers to work for free failed. Skilled professionals want to be paid.\n\nRecently, the team commissioned conceptual designs and an urban plan for the district, and the results have been amazing. With grant funds, we can pay talented architects, modelers, and developers to complete and deploy this design.\n\nWe can create a new kind of commerce and entertainment district with cost-effective leasing options for any company or creator who doesn't want to buy land. By lowering the friction to set up a presence in Decentraland we plan to attract new companies and creators, and their followers, who might not come here otherwise.\n\nThe Nexus project is also partnering with [Parcel](https://parcel.so), the premier metaverse land marketplace, creator directory, and education platform, to present leasing opportunities to potential clients, including well-known companies and brands.\n\n**Cohesive Design and Planning**\n\nThe district design unites shops, galleries, anchor presences, a shared event space, and an open market plaza in a cohesive architectural whole. The initial design concept shows that Nexus can become a spectacular addition to Decentraland, attracting new brands, businesses, and players.\n\n![Nexus Crystal City concept](https://wonderzone.io/img/nexus/NexusCrystalConcept.png \"Nexus Crystal City concept\")\n\nThe large front area is a shared event space where events can be run by any Nexus tenant. It can be configured as a stage for concerts, or as a large screen viewing area for films and video streams.\n\nThe expansive corner quadrants are open to larger companies who want to house their HQ or other custom-built structures in Nexus. These are some of the anchors that should attract new attendees to the district, and benefit from the traffic brought in by other nearby tenants.\n\nThe dramatic \"Crystal City\" structure will become the main Nexus landmark. It's also practical. The larger structures can house multiple shops, galleries, and other leasable spaces.\n\nWe want to bring together world-class design and architecture, fun interactivity, real-world retail brands, and the Decentraland creator community. The resulting district and the attention it will garner could help cement Decentraland’s position as the leading metaverse platform, and demonstrate new use cases and experiences for the future.\n\n**Previous Work**\n\nThe team members are well positioned to deliver. They have already deployed a number of impressive builds in Decentraland.\n\nWith the WonderZone team, Rob Dixon designed and created the [WonderZone Amusement Park](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-50%2C51) and the ever-popular WonderMine game.\n\nIn addition, [LEDY](https://ledy.io) has already built:\n\n*   The [New Scirocco Resort](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-38%2C-105) from their [Extraverse](https://www.extraverse.xyz/) collection. Sold for 42 Eth.\n*   The second resort NFT, [Grand Aurelia](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-17%2C54).\n*   The [607 Beverly Hills Metahouse](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-17%2C54), a replica of a for-sale $9.4M mansion.\n*   The [Ferrari 90210 home](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-17%2C54), a replica of a real-world $17M home.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis grant will be used to fund four aspects of development:\n\n1.  **Refine architectural design, urban planning, and layout.** Starting from the initial concept, we’ll add details regarding urban planning and a unified district map for the district. This will also include design style guidelines for modelers who will create individual structures on the map.\n\n2.  **Build and deploy core structures and shared spaces.** This will include the central Crystal City, the plaza and event space, and the paths and common areas between the leasable lands. LEDY works with a network of talented modelers and can source the best ones to deliver the buildings, landscaping, and other elements we need.\n\n3.  **Build interactive experiences.** We will pay developers to create unique interactive experiences in the district, so every visit is entertaining. One core experience is the convertible event space that can shift from an open music stage to a covered film theater. Other work involves support for easily setting up and configuring shops, gallery spaces, or marketplace booths for creators.\n\n4.  **Brand awareness and public relations.** Building upon branding work being done with Parcel, we will involve a top PR agency to create awareness of Nexus and Decentraland in major media publications. This can attract more companies who are interested in leasing areas within Nexus, and by extension bring new players with them. LEDY’s recent work deploying real estate models in Decentraland to support luxury home sales, amplified by public relations campaigns, got them coverage on TV news and multiple real-world publications.\n\nThis grant alone is not enough to build out the entire district plus all the interactive experiences and commerce infrastructure we envision. We're starting with a relatively small grant so we can show positive results in the first 6 months. Then if there's a need for a future grant we'll have a solid track record of achievement first. Of course, we hope that after 6 months we'll lease many spaces in Nexus, making future grants unnecessary.\n\n**Benefits to the Decentraland Community**\n\nThis project could provide many benefits for the community:\n\n*   The leasing model allows those who can’t afford land to set up their own shop, gallery, or other space. It can help **alleviate concerns about land scarcity pricing people out**. Leasable areas within Nexus can be as small as 1x2 parcels, with low leasing rates.\n\n*   Our tenants share the common event space. It's more cost-effective for a company to build a Decentraland presence without having to buy extra parcels to build their own arena or theater. This might **attract companies that wouldn't come to Decentraland otherwise**.\n\n*   New companies mean **new work for creators who can help them build out their presence**. We are working with Parcel’s Creatorverse program to find creators in the community who want to build out shops, galleries, and other spaces for tenants, and get paid for it.\n\n*   **The more tenants in the district, the more everyone benefits**. We plan on a mix of large anchor presences, plus medium-sized and smaller spaces. Like a thriving mall, people might come to see one space, then be intrigued and investigate the whole district, discovering new creators and experiences as they go.\n\n*   We want to make it **fun to visit Nexus every day**. We'll use learnings from other projects to build surprises, flexible features, frequent events, and even game-like features to keep things interesting.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nDecent Amusements LLC manages Nexus and the nearby WonderZone Park, one of the highest traffic areas in Decentraland.\n\nLEDY is a metaverse real estate developer with extensive experience building luxury metaverse content.\n\nParcel is a virtual real estate marketplace, creator directory and education platform uniquely positioned to offer everything people need to make the most of the metaverse.\n\n**Rob Dixon (Radix)**:\nActive in the Decentraland community since 2017.

    "title": "Should We Utilise Genesis Resources",
    "body": "> by 0x336685bb3a96e13b77e909d7c52e8afcff1e859e (michitodd)\n\nSUMMARY\n This governance pre-proposal is to set up a booking system for the Genesis Plaza Auditorium for a pre-recorded video queue at the cost of 20mana per booking.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nCurrently there are spaces and resources that Decentraland have set up that can’t really be used. Allowing a way to book the auditorium is one way we can boost engagement, allow access to the metaverse for different types of industries and also support local twitch streamers.\n\nPrice has been placed to avoid the service being abused but also not so high it’s unobtainable to some users from a global perspective. This is a high traffic location and the more traffic, the higher mana value will become and this will justify a higher price for this streaming location.\n\nThis will allow users without access to land to hold small events, workshops and shows that’s easily accessible and being local to genesis plaza something to find straight away for new users to engage with. This will also allow Decentraland committee members or foundation to host talks or discuss updates that are separate from townhall.\n\nThe system will work as a kind of Juke-Box so it can be completely automattic without the need of a committee or central management. Users can supply a youtube or vimeo link when booking and the video will be added to the queuing system. When no video is laying it will revert back to the default looping video currently playing.\n\nI’m happy to support where I can as a member of the community to have this implemented so momentum isn’t lost!\n\nMOTIVATION\n Decentraland currently has community resources that can be utilized to support the new users or creators without access to land. With the recent increase of land rental it would allow an easy way to run community events and simple revenue stream of mana into the DAO to fund future grants/proposals.\n\nAllowing a booking system to the auditorium will benefit:\n\n*   Film Makers\n*   Streamers\n*   Podcasts\n*   Musicians/DJs\n*   Educators\n*   Animators\n\nIn the past we’ve seen successful events around movie showings , sports steaming and a need for that shared viewing experience.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION PATHWAYS\n\nQueued video service set up on the Governance forum with a fee to submit\nNPC deployed (I can design or we can use existing robot NPCs) in the Auditorium that can have basic explanation of bookings and link to the governance forum\nVimeo or Youtube link supplied to avoid any harmful or IP infringement content\nContact details supplied and IP ownership signed by users when booking, so if something like unlicensed music or footage is played the ownership is on the user, and not Decentraland\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis can be a test and learn to explore ways to develop new areas of revenue as part of the Decentraland platform, methods to utilise existing resources (Gamer Plaza, Las Vegas etc) and setting up a space to share with the community. This is also experimenting how much the community can influence the user experience in Decentraland community spaces that get overlooked.\n\nA booking system can potentially expand to other community resources owned by Decentraland or foundation. This will reduce barriers to entry for a wide variety of industries and events like short film festivals, comedy shows, live performances, business presentations etc.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=712b6450-1b31-11ed-96c7-2fa07c6df25b)**",

We need to continue improving with onboarding new users, and making it easier for people to understand the platform. It needs to be easier to access land, create content and get solid advise in a secure way, on the same time giving value and income to DCL long term.\n\nHelp us, help growing the community! - We want to help onboard new users, advise them properly and make renting land easier.\n\nEvery land that gets rented, we’ll reward the community as thanks for trusting us = 5% on every sale in commission, which goes directly to the DAO committee wallet. It's managed by official DAO committee members Yemel & HPrivakos.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n22,500 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x29519122d08771Ca4c83C8E3Fa981Df18721f76D\n\n## Email address\n\ndclrealestateagency@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nWHAT WE SOLVE OF PROBLEMS AND GAINS FOR DECENTRALAND\n\n*   Better user-experience for new users\n*   We onboard tons of new people, and answer their questions regarding the best Metaverse Decentraland\n*   We help generate income and new business to Decentraland\n*   We help land gets REAL content. We connect P2E games, NFT galleries, Meta Breweries and much more to land-owners\n*   We need it to be EASY to be a consumer & content creator in DCL.\n*   Prevent scamming and advising users properly.\n\nWe're ready to do our part to IMPROVE Decentraland, and bring growth and income to the Decentraland foundation, on the same time we bring value to the platform, so we can continue being the best metaverse in the world.\n\nOn a short notice:\n\n*   We want to create the best Rental Experience in Decentraland, where land-owners easily can become \"landlords\". Way too much land are empty. We need content, exciting areas and places to visit to make sure we continue grow our platform. We are solving this with our Realtor Rental Platform. We need a smart-contract to ensure the transperency, security and easy-ness to make sure Decentraland Rentals are accessable to all.\n\nAnd YES, we know there are platforms like Double and LandWorks - but they are not the biggest, most active and have the same level of live-chat-support (and even video-calls) like DCL Real Estate does. This is why DCL Real Estate is now requesting a grant from the great and amazing community and DAO in Decentraland.\nWe will provide a technical great solution, which is already in the making. It will be easy to get answers from resources from our Decentraland Experts.. Most users leave the DCL community because they don't understand how our world works - this is why Agents and Trusted Advisors are important.\n\nThis is why we propose, the DAO help us funding our DCL REAL ESTATE RENTAL PLATFORM v2. We're the biggest and best Realtor in Decentraland with most results, and we ask you to help us.\n\nWith this grant, we will be able to create the best rental-platform, that Decentraland has seen. Even more it will have features such as LIVE SUPPORT, Land advise, Scene catalog, Free Scenes to publish, Verified scene makers with live support and best of all - as thanks for the grant we will give back Decentraland and the DAO - 5% in commission on EVERY sale/rental we get on the platform.\n\nDCL Real Estate is a project to contribute to Decentraland. Our job is to get users to interact with the platform in Decentraland, which means use the land as content creation, get buyers and tenants to meet the landlords and sellers, and create a better Decentraland.\n\nA short introduction about us - DCL Real Estate is the biggest and one of the first realtors in Decentraland. We provide services such as “Selling”, “buying” and “renting land” services.\n\nWe’re onboarding new users to Decentraland every day, and we keep on being one of the first encounters on many occasions when people explore how they can get started building and further grow Decentraland, with lands and content. With granting us the funds we will be able to grow the land- and rental market within Decentraland, and on the same time making DCL Real Estate decentralized through giving DAO shares, on 5% on every sale. We will appoint a board to adjust our own rate and commission, so it's fair and affordable. (Cheaper than today) Most likely 2,5% to 10% to the realtor platform.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nBlockchain: Ethereum\n\nTools:\nvscode, hardhat, metamask for smart contract\nReact, redux, tailwind for website\nReact, redux, react native for app\n\nIssue: the community is riddled with scammers within a peer to peer transactional space. This results in lower trust in Decentraland, and therefore less community usage and interaction. It also empowers easy access to rent, with possibility to access a Trusted Advisor who knows the DCL space, and on the same time access utilities such as a free scene - and income to the DAO which means the people of Decentraland.\n\nSolution: this rental smart contract will provide additional comfort for land owners and prospective buyers/renters, as they will no longer have to worry about being scammed. We will become an added small business within decentraland, bring additional volume, and showing evidence of successful business operations within a leading metaverse platform.\n\nUsers can easily:\n\n1.Tenants can easily rent lands easy on the site\n2.Landlords can list their lands easy on the site.\n\\---> Free Scene access\n\\---> Premium Scenes access\n\\---> Live Support from DCL Experts (Building experts, Land experts, General support)\n\\---> Help to increase security and prevent scam\n\\---> 5% commission to DAO/DCL on each sale/rental.\n\nTHE PROCESS TO RENT (As a Tenant)\n1.User connect wallet\n2.User find the wanted land, and press \"rent land\" and pay's (For example 1-12 months)\n3.Landlord automaticly get's operator assigned to tenant's address or manually add another operator\n4.Money gets in Escrow wallet\n5.Money gets released after 30 days to landlord (+ DAO fee and Platform fee's withdrawn)\n6.Tenant will automatic pay every 30 days, and the lease will end if payment has failed, and other tenants will be able to access and rent the landlords' land.\n\nTHE PROCESS TO LEASE (As a Land-owner/Landlord)\n1.User connect wallet\n2.User press \"List land\" choose how much they want to earn, rental period etc.\n3.Landlord signs smart-contract.\n\nIMPORTANT TO NOTICE:\nA landowner can ALWAYS remove operator or sell a land. It is not possible to make sure they can't, so this is a fully secure rental-system which will provide security for the tenant's funds, and landlord's land asset. This is why this project DO NOT transfer any land-nft-asset but simply acts as a money-middleman, and takes a fee for doing it automatic, easy and cheap. If a landlord/landowner proceed to remove operator/sell the land after renting it out, the tenant will be refunded, and the land-owners' address will be noticed as a \"Bad Landlord\".\n\nDAO will get income from the sales and rentals, aswell as the landlord and realtor platform fee's.\n\nPayments and commissions to DAO will be sent to:\nEither DAO directly: https://etherscan.io/address/0x9a6ebe7e2a7722f8200d0ffb63a1f6406a0d7dce\n\nOr Multisig owned by the DAO Committee (Yemel and HPrivakos): https://etherscan.io/address/0x89214c8Ca9A49E60a3bfa8e00544F384C93719b1\n\nWe will make the smart-contract and address changeable, because DAO is still new and it's growing fast so we might need to change in the future, after advise from DAO committee members.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nTHE TEAM:\nLead Developer & Blockchain Developer:\n\nAaron Porchia (https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-porchia-054a96239/)\nWeb3 Development Manager:\n\nTravis Holm (T-rav#0132 on discord)\nCo-Founder & CEO of DCL Real Estate:\n\nEmil Klockmann (Klockmann#3349 on discord)\nRental Agent, Co-Founder & DCL Expert:\n\nChristoffer Laursen (Laursen#4812 on discord)\n\n***\n\nDEV-TEAM RESULTS AND BACKGROUN:\n\nETH projects:\nOxygen token\nStrip token\nleaf token\nball token\nDefiPlaza token\n\nMessaging app on ETH:\nhttps://www.epigeon.org/\n\nNFT Marketplaces:\nhttps://portion.io/\nhttps://www.nftation.io/\n\nNFT Collections:\nhttps://themetakey.com/\nhttps://mooncat.community/\nhttps://nbayc.co/\n\nExchanges:\nhttps://defiplaza.net/\nBinance\n\nPET NFT and staking rewards:\nhttps://pets.micropets.io/\n\nSocial media platform in solana:\nhttps://satellite.one/\n\nTrading platform:\nhttps://www.orca.so/\n\n***\n\nSite:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EojSz4K.png\nwww.DclRealEstate.org\n\nBudget:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/0o7AvJL\n\nLinks:\nWebsite: https://dclrealestate.org/\n\nEmail: dclrealestateagency@gmail.com\n\nDiscord server: https://discord.gg/XBjCRTbRZP\n\nOffice in DCL: https://dclrealestate.dcl.eth/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DCL_RealEstate\n\nArticle about us: https://medium.com/@hugh.blaxland/newcomers-dcl-real-estate-driving-development-in-decentraland-1da112c1d210\n\nFor any further questions we are ready to answer any questions you might have.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis project will be completed within 6 weeks-6months.\n\nAnd the roadmap is as follows:\n\nMonth 1-3: Development of the FUTURE of Rental platform. UI and UX designing, Smart Contract Development & Website app creation\n\nMonth 4: Code Audition\n\nMonth 5: Internal Testing, Debug and Code Polish. Also development of resources, tips, tricks, videos and onboarding to platform and DCL.\n\nMonth 6: Official launch and income generating\n\nWe strive to make the project release before it's due. But it's important EVERYTHING is perfect, and make sure the quality of the project.\n\nTo keep track of all of the related update, we'll release reports and share them on our Discord & in the DAO grant community on their discord: https://discord.gg/XBjCRTbRZP - but we will also be ready to answer questions on the forum and on email.\n\nThe DCL Real Estate already implemented rentals and sold results for more than 30+ clients and smart contracts will make rewards and security better and easier combined with advisory to new users of DCL to make Decentraland the best Metaverse, so it makes sense for DAO to do this execution. The funds will go entirely to the community through commission on rentals.\n\nWe're ready for the future of Real Estate and the rental market in Decentraland. Help us, by helping Decentraland building it. Are you ready for it?\n\nThank you for reading✅.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0c233e00-18ef-11ed-96c7-2fa07c6df25b)**",

I was wondering if I could request for an advertising funding and buy advertisement on YouTube, so that more people could understand what it is to be a parcel owner and the steps involved?\n\nMy video has nothing to do with price predictions or parcel predictions, but more of an outline of what to consider before buying land, buying land, and what you can do after buying land.\n\nMy experience as a parcel owner: https://youtu.be/\\_p4tPkakm3Q\n\nThe question I have is whether the community would be interested in this request for grant and if something similar has been done before? Usually what would be the budget for a similar request and what proof or deliverables are needed if a proposal is approved?\n\nSo far everything that I have done with regards to the channel are all non-paid, since I really want to let people know more about the Web 3.0 space, besides some transaction fees, I could basically allocate thee whole budget on the advertisement spend, since I really hope to let people understand this space.\n\nLooking forward to your feedback and advice!\n\nThanks,\nNon-Fungible TC\n\n- Yes, would be interested!\n- No, would not be interested!\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=656574a0-18d2-11ed-96c7-2fa07c6df25b)**",

    "body": "> by 0xc82fd31500576f394b59be3b10c154b584ea6004 (ShelleyVan)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nSinfulMeatStick (Sinful) is a highly supportive, essential Decentraland (DCL) community builder and Twitch streamer. Through his company, SinfulMedia, he is seeking DAO funding to help continue providing high-value content to the DCL community, as well as help provide streaming services to fellow community members who may not have this resource free of cost.\n\nAs a Twitch streamer, show host, community builder, and content creator, Sinful has worked with established DCL groups, projects, and wearable creators such as The Babydolls, The Rocking Uniquehorns (TRUs), Penguin Fight Club, Tangpoko, and Kirzoz. Financial assistance from the DAO will allow Sinful to focus his full attention on creating, building, and expanding the DCL community.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x876D9Bb007Ec7795C5bF887832220b5B43Cc9cFb\n\n## Email address\n\nshelleyvan@songbirdcoagency.com\n\n## Description\n\nAs one of the most active Twitch streamers and content creators in Decentraland, Sinful has been creating and onboarding new users in the space for more than eight months, an accomplishment he says fills him with gratitude and pride. Sinful also hosts a weekly show titled, “Beyond The NFT,” which is streamed simultaneously on Twitch and in Decentraland.\n\nDuring the last five months, he has interviewed some of the most iconic figures of DCL, including Roustan, Aaron Leupp, Tangpoko, Micheal K, DoctorDripp, and many more. Additionally, “Beyond the NFT” has been a springboard for many aspiring musical talents in DCL, such as CIB and BabyYors. Recently, Sinful interviewed Kelly Ann Collins, founder, and CEO of VultLab and Into The Meta News (https://kac.start.page/).\n\nSinful also hosts the highly engaging, weekly Twitter Spaces talk, “Decentraland Community Building,\" along with long-serving DCL community member, Canessa. During the show, Sinful and Canessa give community members a stage to voice their feelings, ideas, and concerns about Decentraland, and they also discuss ways on how we can bring web2 audiences into our home world, Decentraland.\n\nSinful is a founder of the Community Building Decentraland (CBD) Discord server, where Decentraland community members are actively engaging with one another in efforts to build a stronger and more collaborative Decentraland environment. Since the launch of this Discord server, it has quickly become a hub for many DCL communities to connect, network, and create, as well as share knowledge and resources. Sinful is active in numerous web3 Twitter Spaces, always inviting artists, singers, and creators to join and explore the possibilities this space has to offer. Sinful also invests much of his time in welcoming and onboarding new members to the DCL community, a personal approach that he believes is of primary importance to retaining new users.\n\nMany of you may know me as the manager of the TRU Band Room--I'm ShelleyVan. I've been a DCL citizen since July 2021. In that time I've planned and hosted nearly 300 live events and onboarded nearly 100 musicians and countless new users. During this time, Sinful has remained an integral part of the community-building process, providing a friendly voice and wealth of web3 knowledge to anyone I send his way. As part of the DCL ecosystem, Sinful is crucial for growth.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nFunding from the DAO will allow Sinful to continue providing content to our Decentraland communities and, through SinfulMedia, provide high-quality streaming services to fellow DCL members free of cost. He also plans to make user-friendly “how to” videos to make the flow of information easily digestible for new users. Both “Beyond The NFT” and “Decentraland Community Building” Twitter Space are broadcast to Twitch and Decentraland via RTMP server, providing clear content of the highest quality in Decentraland and on Twitch.\n\nThe RTMP server is Sinful’s biggest financial consideration and continuing to fully fund that server often stifles his creative process, which neglects the community of valuable content and community building. Keeping the RTMP server funded is crucial for the onboarding of new musicians, artists, and DJs by allowing Sinful to provide them a stage on which to perform.\n\nPreliminary work Beyond The NFT: Average 30 viewers on twitch and 40-50 users on parcel\nhttps://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=c66eb4bb-9035-4f12-95dc-74ed4a62a93f\n\nDecentraland Community Building Twitter Space: Average 20 viewers on Twitch, 35+ listeners on Twitter, and 15+ people on parcel\nhttps://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=ddcf355b-6fd6-41b5-9f0c-46a3d7f824a5\n\nFund Allocation for 1 year:\nRTMP funding: $5500\nHardware costs: $5000\nSoftware/services: $1000\nTravel: $5000\nSalary: $43,500 (approx. $20/hour at 40 hours/week)\n\nAverage annual salary for Community Relations Managers in his area is $99,000 as of July 26, 2022, but the range typically falls between $82,150 and $119,916.

The solution will expand limits for users, who can’t afford to acquire certain NFTs - with LendIT they’ll be able to borrow it for a set period of time.\nThe key feature of LendIT is an escrow wallet, that’s similar to Metamask, but includes some additional functionality. Borrowed NFT arrives in this wallet and the borrower can use it by logging into the game using the provided wallet. The NFT can not be moved from this wallet and automatically returns to the Lender’s wallet when the covered rent period is over. Borrowers can also send their own NFTs to the escrow wallet, so they can use all other collected NFTs with the borrowed one.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n75,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x40439def1d1ad636d162c9253ba977f66ede181e\n\n## Email address\n\nyaroslav.panchenko@megadevllc.com\n\n## Description\n\nEven tho NFT is one of the hottest trends nowadays, our team has figured out that there is one important part of the whole system missing, which is the mechanism of NFT lending. Let\\`s imagine a situation, where an average gamer wants to purchase a certain item in the videogame, a conditional sword, to deal tons of damage to his enemies, but it is too expensive for him. In this case, only his wallet will take a lot of damage. Fortunately, the MeGaDev team sees a solution. In our opinion, the player would be happy to rent this item, so they can feel all of its properties and enjoy the gameplay.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPlease find a small pitch deck with all technical details by the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wc8WVdMLWzJwSlygn9cfEOTMVWiA6AJG/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nmegadevllc.com production team is going to be working on this project.

I ask for understanding and help from the community, I am in good faith. Please read all i wrote in the \"Description\" of this grant request. For me is very important.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n358 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x7c41ccdc26a9aaefa05ac0bd9c9c9d7bb5bd89f9\n\n## Email address\n\ncaligola848@hotmail.it\n\n## Description\n\nI sent some days ago, around 335 mana from poloniex to bittrex, before to sent my mana I verified if the contract was correct (when you deposit a token on bittrex, bittrex advice you to do this). When I copied the bittrex address for the deposit, I don't pressed correctly the keys control+C of my keyboard, so unfortunately during the paste, I used the mana's contract address (last value stored before my new copy and paste wrong). Due to the fact that the alphanumeric addresses are similar I let the transaction go. Usually I'm extremely careful to do these operations, but for first time I was wrong. These mana are very important for me, I'm a student, I need of it. I know that in the cryptoworld 335 mana are insignificant, aren't 1M of mana, but for me are very very important. So the only way to recover my mana (as advice from the developers who unfortunately can't recover my mana) is to ask a grant, a grant to be understood as a help to a guy who was just unlucky during a transaction, I know every transaction must be conducted with care, but I just hope for your understanding, it could happen to everyone.\nI can provide a screenshot of my poloniex activity like proof of my error in good faith if is necerssary. My transaction hash is:\nTransaction Hash:\n\n0xa92a985348206d5954ff238d2d75069ebef4cea6d64953401a7eaf95f27f28c0\n\nand like you can see my transaction started effectively exactly from\nPoloniex with destinantion the Mana's contract. As advice from a dev, I used the value of 335 Mana at market price in usd with an increase of arount 30 dollars to cover a bit any upward movements. In every case if the price will be more low, like I wrote to a dev, I will return an eventual surplus to the DAO itself. I just need to recover my mana and not more. In this moment the price is around 1.07$ for mana (binance) so I will try to ask 358$, not more. I trust in the understanding of the community and I thank those who want to help me.\n\nFeel free to contact me by mail.

    "body": "> by 0x2e09a10eaace1ef3a66fbf6f1f782c8c0cb8c942 (Armadillo)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nDungeons and Dragons is played worldwide by an enormous range of players and it is no less intriguing to watch others play as evidenced by\nthe great success of organizations such as Critical Role. We believe a good implementation of this concept has the power to introduce many new users to Decentraland!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2e09A10eaAcE1Ef3a66FbF6F1F782C8c0cb8c942\n\n## Email address\n\ncenmodelscontact@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n### Goal\n\nThe main goal in creating this game is to expand the user base of Decentraland and showcase it as a place to have fun! Decentraland has many casinos and other establishments that require financial investments from players and thus, for an ordinary user Decentraland looks like a place where everyone wants to get money from you - but it is and can be much more than that!\n\n### Original proposal\n\nhttps://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-bafkrei-dungeons-and-dragons-decentraland/13138\n\n### TL;DR changes in resubmission\n\n*   Renting land for a reduced price through [@dax](https://governance.decentraland.org/balance/?address=0x895be97bdb9f8a244c472b18ea96dee39ddf8fe5)\n*   Updated budget focused towards achieving a concrete six month Roadmap\n*   More details re: past team experiences in game and software development\n\nWe believe that the main thing missing in Decentraland is the reasons for an\nordinary user rather than an investor to join Decentraland. The main goal of our game is to become such a reason and thereby attract a large number of new users to Decentraland.\n\nThe game we want to create will be inspired by Dungeons and Dragons but won’t be a copy of it. We decided to simplify some mechanics so that the game fits better into Decentraland and is easy to understand for all users regardless of roleplay experience\n\n### Scope\n\nThe scope of this grant proposal is ~8 months, until about the end of March\n2023\\. In that time our goal is to release a game in several steps until we have,\nby the end of this time, a fully working v1 of our game accessible to all\nDecentraland users.\n\n### Game mechanics\n\nAs we mentioned, we decided to build a roleplaying experience specific to\nDecentraland. Some of those modifications are:\n\n*   A session in D\\&D lasts on average 2-3 hours; in our game, we want to reduce the time of one session to 40-60 minutes.\n*   An AI (Artificial Intelligence) will perform the role of the gamemaster (host), so players will have a limited number of action options in a given situation.\n*   Players will choose one of the proposed characters rather than creating one themselves.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### How we see the final result:\n\n1.  Each player (3-5 players in total in one session) is given random characters.\n2.  Each character has characteristics (strength, charisma, etc.), specific items\n    in the inventory (crossbow, potion, etc.), and other differences.\n3.  The characters find themselves in a situation where they need to solve a problem or\n    receive a task from a non-player character in the story.\n\nFor example, a simple scenario might be that players start their journey in a\ntavern, and they need to find a villager who is a werewolf.\n\nThe main gameplay will lay in the fact that players will choose options for actions, such as: \"Inspect the tavern,\" or \"Approach the tavern and start talking to the quiet villager”\n\nSome actions’ success gets determined by a dice roll. For example, to \"Sneak\nattack the guard\" you need to roll a dice to test your dexterity. The required number for success is a 10; you roll the dice, if you roll a ten or lower you miss, greater than 10 and you hit.\n\nIn total, the player will change up to 5 locations during the game. The game\nends when the players have completed the task, failed it, or when all the players’ characters have died.\n\nDue to the variability, the game has great replay value. Play as another\ncharacter, take other companions to your team, and the game outcome will be\ncompletely different. We also plan to release new scripts regularly.\n\n### Budget Breakdown\n\n***Total: 60k***\n\n***Team Salaries: 49k***\n\n*   *15k SDK Dev*\n*   *15k 3D Artists*\n*   *8k  Game Designer*\n*   *4k  Game Master*\n*   *4k  2D Artist*\n*   *3k  Sound Designer*\n\n***Marketing: 6k***\n\n***Servers and infrastructure: 3k***\n\n***Land Rental for 6 months: 2k***\n\n### Tech Stack\n\nMuch of the game will be built using the Decentraland SDK but part of the infrastructure will be external. For this we will use a custom built backend server to store player scores, preferences, gaming history, and more.\n\n### Revenue plan / Sustainability\n\nWhile we do plan to create some wearables and possibly make some purchases available, adding a large number of profit-making functions will greatly burden the project, and making a profit is not our goal.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n### Core team\n\n**Soulsinger** - manager of the CEN studio; game designer;\nthe ideological inspirer of the project\n\n**Dax** - SDK Developer\nIn Decentraland since 2017;\n10 years of software development experience;\nwinner of the 2022 DCL Game Jam\n\n**Casuallvl** & **Orina** - 3d artists.\nSpecialists in 3D modelling of low-poly objects\n\n**Master Eador** - Gamemaster.\nLongtime TTRPG player;\n2 years experience as a professional gamemaster\n\n**Mia** - 2d artist.\nArt student with experience in building game assets\n\n**Alexander** - Sound designer.\nKnown in some circles as ‘The Man with Three Ears’\n\n### Relevant experience\n\nEach member of our team has been working in game development for many years.

I have wearable books, some wearables that are part of the lore from Voxels, other that are homages to art history, some halloween wearables too, some vehicles, some megavox buildings. I have a large collection of NFTs, with 1.8 eth sold for now.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nI believe in the idea of Open Metaverse, so I think to allow people to have their wearables in any world is a real step for us to achieve what metaverse must be. Wearables are part of the identity of people, so they must be carried with them. Beyond that, I believe that artistic wearables, as the ones from art history, are important to be represented on Decentraland, because it shows that metaverse is also serious concerning art, and it is an opportunity for players to use art history avatars. Buildings and objects can help newbies to build. Collection on polygon.\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n100\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nI dont know what would be proof. I am logged here with my wallet, that is the same wallet who is the owner of the collection. So I imagine this is proof. https://www.voxels.com/collections/polygon/0xBbf177CE3afeFFa489f06D6Cf928Cd1D58b7DE30\nHere you can see the owner of the collection, who is me.

    "body": "> by 0xb77af992749615e989acb2ce3d40f748f07b8de8 (Hardcore#8de8)\n\n[Fringe Finance](https://app.fringe.fi)  is offering the Decentraland DAO to use MANA tokens as collateral to borrow up to $10,695,406 in USDC to be utilized at the discretion of the DAO.\n\n**Abstract:**\n\n[Fringe Finance](https://app.fringe.fi) is a decentralized money market designed to unlock the capital spread in crypto assets regardless of their capitalization and supported networks.\n\n![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/760/1\\*uHSSawc1I5qg60VP-lldNQ.png)\n\nRecently Fringe Finance [announced](https://fringefinance.medium.com/were-listing-decentraland-s-mana-on-august-5th-d29de2304e20) that on the 5th of August MANA token will be integrated as a collateral asset allowing holders to access USDC loans.\nThe benefits for MANA token holders and the Decentraland DAO are described below.\nMotivation:\nBorrowing against MANA to fund the DAO’s operations instead of selling benefits all the holders by removing selling pressure.\nThe Decentraland DAO borrowing against its MANA holdings, rather than selling them, both signals alignment and better align its interests with those of MANA holders.\nUSDC is one of the most trusted stablecoins on the market with deep liquidity.\n\nFringe Finance announced the integration of MANA on the 5th of August MANA as a collateral asset to borrow USDC.\n\nFringe Finance provides added utility for all holders of MANA including the Decentraland DAO by allowing them to borrow USDC against their MANA.\n\nThe MANA community can utilize borrowed USDC funds elsewhere in the crypto ecosystem without the necessity to sell MANA tokens.\n\n**Specification:**\n\nMANA has been assigned a loan-to-value ratio of 43% on Fringe Finance. This means that for every $1000 worth of MANA collateral a $430 loan can be taken.\nThe current borrowing interest is 2.34%/year, but the rate is currently floating(\\*).\nThe borrowing limit for MANA on Fringe Finance is currently $10,695,406.\n\n**Steps:**\n\nDeposit sufficient MANA token collateral on the Fringe Finance platform from the treasury.\nThe corresponding USD-denominated line of credit is issued.\nUp to $10,695,406 USDC loan can be taken and used by the Decentraland DAO.\nAnnounce the taken loan on social media and official blog. If the loan will not take place announce the additional utility of the Fringe Finance integration for the community.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\nReduced selling pressure on the market\nSignals the additional utility to MANA holders in that they can access stablecoin loans\nFund DAO operation by locking MANA tokens and increasing cash flow\n\n**About Fringe Finance:**\n\nWe‘re partners with projects such as Polygon, Chainlink, REN, Elrond, Bancor, IoTeX, Lido, and others.\n\nFringe Finance has twice been audited by respected [firms](https://github.com/HashEx/public_audits/blob/master/Fringe%20Finance/Fringe%20Finance.pdf).\n\nOn Fringe, borrowers deposit collateral against which they may take out loans in a select set of the most liquid and reliable USD stablecoins. The resultant benefit for borrowers on Fringe Finance is that they have access to deep, unfragmented capital pools from which to borrow. This significantly reduces both the interest rate slippage they can expect when taking out a loan, in addition to reducing interest rate volatility over the course of their loan.\n\nFringe’s depth and concentration of lending capital liquidity also benefit lenders, as it similarly reduces the interest rate slippage they can expect to experience when depositing capital as well as reducing fluctuations in the interest paid on their capital. This indirectly benefits borrowers, as lending on Fringe becomes more attractive, resulting in more capital being available at lower interest rates.\n\nAn additional indirect benefit for borrowers is that Fringe’s platform employs empirically sound custom algorithms to determine lending parameters so as to maximize platform stability. This attracts lenders to the platform and therefore results in greater capital available for borrowers.\n\n- Support funding $MANA community operations on Fringe Finance’s Primary Lending Platform\n- Do not support\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c4fc8f70-13c3-11ed-affb-95d45c2147f8)**",

    "title": "POI Management Optimizations: Unify POI lists and improve the operational aspect",
    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[POI Management Optimizations: Unify POI lists and improve the operational aspect](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d43ed210-fd5f-11ec-8fbf-839e0f96469a)\n\n## Summary\n\nUpdate the current POI management mechanism by removing the centralized list and unifying it with the decentralized DAO-maintained list, migrate that list to Polygon (cost reduction) and outside of Aragon (Better UX)\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to solve the existing complexity created by having two POI lists, [one centralized under the Decentraland Foundation](https://config.decentraland.org/explorer.json) and the other maintained by the DAO using an Aragon smart contract. The proposed solution encompasses: Deleting the Legacy POI list, and moving the DAO-maintained POI list from the Ethereum mainnet to Polygon and outside of the Aragon infrastructure in order to reduce the costs and enhance the experience of adding and removing POIs. Finally, the DAO core teams will encourage the community to create proposals under the Add POI category in the Decentraland DAO Governance dApp to add the POIs that are still considered relevant.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs the project keeps moving towards an even more decentralized future, having a list that cannot be modified by the community or having two lists that community developers need to take into consideration when building products for the Decentraland ecosystem is a weak spot. Especially if that list contains such essential places in the Decentraland world as Genesis Plaza, the Decentraland Museum, or the Crypto Valley.\n\nAlso, moving the DAO-maintained list away from the Ethereum mainnet and Aragon infrastructure into Polygon will reduce operational costs (Currently adding/removing POIs cost ~200USD in gas fees) and make the process for the DAO Committee easier, as using Aragon to send transactions is not ideal UX-wise.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nBelow is a proposed list of milestones:\n\n\\-Launch a communication campaign regarding this change and encourage Decentraland users to submit POI addition proposals for the POIs present on the Legacy POI list they still consider relevant (~30 days)\n\n\\-Once that period ends, the DAO Committee will engage with the Decentralad Foundation teams to orchestrate how the change will be done. This will be communicated to the Decentraland community via Discord and the Forum.\n\n\\-The actions to be orchestrated will be: Delete the Legacy POI list, enact the addition of the new POIs on the DAO-maintained list by the DAO Committee (Ideally those two actions should happen synchronously), and migrate the DAO-maintained list to Polygon.\n\n\\-Communicate to the community the result of these actions.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\n**Best case scenario**\nThe community submitted all the relevant POIs to be approved in time and no actually relevant POI is forgotten or missing.  The merge and migration go completely as expected, there is no gap between honoring the hardcoded list and the DAO-maintained one resulting in total availability of the POIs appearing on the minimap. Polygon migration is performed successfully.\n\n**Worst case scenario**\nThe community does not engage in the process of the POI proposal creation, some important POIs are forgotten resulting for example in a relevant parcel no longer appearing as a POI on the minimap. The merge gets complicated resulting in a gap where we are not honoring the hardcoded list anymore but the smart contract is not updated yet. Polygon migration fails.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n**Unifying POI lists**\n\n*   Communication campaign notifying the community that this initiative has passed and that from now on they can submit POI addition proposals for the POIs present on the Legacy POI list they still consider relevant (~30 days)\n*   Once the period ended, stop honoring the Foundation maintained POI list and enact all the approved POIs to the Smart Contract (Mainnet)\n*   Move to the second milestone (Polygon Migration)\n\n**Migrating POI Smart Contract to Polygon**\n\n*   Deploy POIs contract in polygon owned by an EOA\n*   Migrate all the existing POIs with a script to the new POIs polygon smart contract\n*   Transfer the ownership to the DAO committee multisig\n*   Deploy a POIs subgraph in Polygon so the Decentraland Foundation Catalyst team can start using it.\n*   Notify the Decentraland Foundation Platform team about this change\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy doing this we keep empowering Decentraland users to make decisions about the project via proper DAO Governance mechanisms while simplifying the operations and reducing the costs of adding and removing POIs. As the Decentraland community and the activity grows, being cost-effective and quick regarding these changes will lead to a better experience for the users. Also, taking out the embedded Legacy -POI list from the World Explorer (a.k.a. Reference Client) removes the control of a centralized entity and gives everyone the same access to leveraging the POI list on their own implementations.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=51724740-1362-11ed-affb-95d45c2147f8)**",

We’ve found this provides an acceptable trade-off between precision and infrastructure strain.\n\nFrom there we calculate metrics from the raw data - at present this happens once per day, but we have plans to run these jobs more often to more closely approach “live” in-world metrics. For the alpha version, we focused solely on global level aggregations, which are immediately meaningful at a high level such as daily active users and parcels.\n\n**Future Tech // DAO tools**\n\nAs part of the research that has gone into this proposal, I’ve had discussions with many members of the Decentraland community including MorrisMustang and howieDoin as [their recent proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=66d76070-0d27-11ed-92a2-218eab5ea42b) fits quite well with what we are aiming to do.\n\nWhereas the aim of their proposal is to create a robust framework to provide developers reliable access to the public data of Decentraland, our intention is to display that data in an accessible way to end users, regardless of the level of their technical skill.\n\nWhen the time comes we hope to be able to seamlessly transition from relying on the catalyst servers as a source of data to pulling data more efficiently from Atlas Corp.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**Team**\n\n*Dax*\n\n*   10 years in backend development\n*   Part of the Decentraland community since the Genesis Auction\n\n*Jongwoo*\n\n*   Recently graduated CS major focused on modern frontend\n*   Lifelong nerd\n\nWe’ve known each other for 5+ years and have done several side-projects together.

It is currently on a 7x7 estate located at coordinates 126, 44. Our goal is to create a fun and vibrant gaming community with a player-driven economy; by which, individuals can own items in the form of blockchain assets that they can buy/sell/trade as they please. Our experienced team of programmers, designers, and support personnel bring years of talent to enable us to meet this goal.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x5117571b0BEc00372CE00870ad8E523C704a78b7\n\n## Email address\n\njoshuajtv1@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nDecentraland (DCL) allows for an immense amount of personal creativity and freedom. DCL creates the opportunity to engage with others in novel ways in an expansive virtual space; be that by attending concerts and galleries, or playing games. We seek to expand on the gaming options within DCL by building Exodus: Goodbye World!\n\nWe feel that having a large-scale, frequently updated game within the DCL platform will provide years of entertainment and financial value to the community. It will help drive increased user traffic into DCL and to the overall DCL gaming scene. Exodus aims to be massive, immersive, and create an engaging player experience. Initially set in a medieval era, players will be able to train their skills, gather a variety of resources, craft tools & equipment, and even earn NFTs through gameplay. As we approach and overcome the challenges of hosting a huge variety of items on-chain, we will eventually bridge in-game resources to public blockchain(s). This will help create a player driven Play-and-Earn economy where players can truly own the results of their hard in-game work. In developing Exodus, we have a heavy focus on educational outreach. We are providing opportunities for interns and community members who want to be part of our journey. Whether the focus is design or software development, our team environment is supportive of those who want to learn and contribute to the project.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nExodus has already started its Beta. Throughout the beta we will be creating and adding portions of the game on a regular schedule. Before launching the beta we worked passionately on the front-end and back-end infrastructure to ensure the basic gaming mechanics were enabled. This included the Inventory interface, Banking functionality, Daily challenges, Leveling system, Beta Currency, and two gaming objectives - Woodchopping and Fishing. We also created the scenery and over 100 assets for use in the game.\n\nThe Beta of Exodus went live on June 20th, 2022 at coordinates 126,44. In the 5 weeks since, we have created and enabled an in-game Merchandise interface, rolled out Scavenger Hunting, and nearly completed preparations for the next gaming objective - Mining. Future releases will involve other skills and activities, including Workshopping, Forging, Cooking, and Hunting. During beta, we will be writing an in-depth storyline so that Questing activities can be included post-beta.\n\nWe plan to continue to release major updates on a monthly basis, as permitted, until the full game completion. We aim to deliver minor bug fixes, quality of life updates, and patches on a weekly to biweekly basis. Please view our video that walks you through the beginning stages of our game: Exodus is in an open beta and will continue to further stress test the game’s infrastructure and prepare for public release.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdsrU_Mz9no\n\nWe use a variety of technologies for software development, design, server maintenance, and project organization. This includes, but is not limited to: AWS, Discord, Github, Blender, the Adobe Suite, and Visual Studio.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nOur team consists of 16 team members and continues to grow. We are a group of video game enthusiasts who have a complimentary variety of skill and experience. This includes experience in blockchain applications, back-end infrastructure, the DCL SDK, graphic design, and 3D design & animation. We have regular team meetings and constantly collaborate in order to bring the project to life.\n\n**Our team includes: Leadership**\n\n*   Myself: Owner, Influencer, Streamer Engineering\n*   1 Lead Architect ( 8 years full-stack development experience ) – 1 Senior Back-End Engineer\n*   2 College Interns split between Front-End and Back-End Art & Design\n*   1 Lead Scene Designer ( 10 years in 3D game design, secondary focus on front-end development )\n*   1 Animator & UI Designer\n*   4 Asset Artists ( Both 2D and 3D assets ) Support\n*   1 Web Designer\n*   1 Head of Marketing\n*   1 Story Writer\n*   1 Video Editor\n*   1 Product Advisor\n\nWe continue to provide opportunities for interns and other community members who want to be part of our journey, and would like to be able to utilize this grant to expand these efforts. Whether the focus is design or software development, our team environment is supportive of those who want to learn and contribute to the project.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nFunding will be divided into Engineering (paying developers and interns, and recruiting more interns), Design (paying artists), Marketing (designing promotional videos & running ads), and miscellaneous expenses like music (we plan to create custom themed music), story writing, and server upkeep. These values are approximate and subject to change depending on need. The funding will be divided approximately into the following amounts: Engineering - $125,000 Design – $75,000 Marketing - $25,000 Miscellaneous - $15,000\n\n**Roadmap and milestones Current milestones & achievements:**\n\n*   List item Woodchopping (released June 20th)\n*   List item Merch Store (released June 27th)\n*   List item Scavenger Hunting (July 9th)\n*   List item Fishing (July 30th)\n\n**Current roadmap:**\n\n*   Workshopping (end of August)\n*   Mining (end of September)\n*   Forging (end of October)\n*   Cooking (end of November)\n    \\*Hunting (end of December)\n\nPlease note, this is subject to delay, advancement, and change.\n\nThe Exodus team will have a monthly report posted on \"Project Updates\" upon grant approval.\n\nAs well, we have consistent updates, progress, bug fixes, etc... across these socials.\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/j_t_v\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JTV\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ExodusGBW\n\nhttps://discord.com/invite/jtv\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4dcc98d0-10e6-11ed-affb-95d45c2147f8)**",

We do this through:\n\nHelping platforms (like Decentraland) and their creators, understand their users through our unique AI classification platform, to improve liveops, monetisation, user lifetime value and retention.\\*\nProviding the gaming and metaverse industry with the only liveops runtime tool for sustainable game economy ideation, creation, simulation & testing, deployment, and ongoing management and maintenance.\n\nWe do this with our two core products, the Metanomic Economy Engine and the Metanomic Thunderstruck AI Data Analytics Platform.\n\nTHE ECONOMY ENGINE:\n\nA full runtime, real-time, economy engine that plugs into any game, that anyone can use to:\n\nSimply and easily build an entire game economy in minutes rather than months\nSimulate their economy,\nDeploy at the click of a button,\nBalance and update game economy states in real-time,\nFeed analytics back to creators and owners,\nSegment users and run simulations based on economy changes.\n\nThis means, games, metaverse platforms, defi projects, and digital experiences can now transition away from spreadsheets, high-risk timescales, and capital requirements, to our run-time platform.\n\nTHE THUNDERSTRUCK DATA MANAGEMENT PLATFORM\n\nAllows web3 platforms and creators to:\n\nClassify and categorise any user data for any industry (on and off chain), to enable hyper-segmentation for a massive range of use cases using:\n\n*   First-party data - Data collected from website visits, CRM systems, social media, subscriptions, mobile, and apps.\n*   Second-party data - Derived from a mutually beneficial relationships with another entities (partners, suppliers, etc.).\n*   Third-party data - From on chain and from web2 websites and social media platforms that can be used to reach a wider audience and augment first-party data to increase scale and reach and improve personalisation.\n\nBecause of our Economy Engine, we are creating a new source of active data that no-one else in the world has access to and intelligence from. This economy data can feed in to the AI to provide the highest-quality classifications of users for the entire gaming industry to empower LiveOps campaigns, advertising & marketing, increasing Ad Delivery revenue generation, and so much more.\n\nAs a result, we have the best AI platform on the market to:\n\nEnrich any data, (1st, 2nd, or 3rd party data),\nClassify and categorise data and contextual behaviours at scale,\nFeed creators' own data back to them to further optimise their experiences for more engagement and retention.\n\nAND TOGETHER\n\nBy combining Engine's ability to manage economic instances with Thunderstruck's ability to turn those economic instances into actionable insights, which can in turn be used to further optimise economic instances to maximise player retention and engagement in terms of both time and money spent in play and platform, we can help Decentraland, and its creators to design and run more fun, and more profitable metaverse expenses to convert intrinsic value into shared extrinsic value and virtuous cycles for all parties.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThunderstruck version 1 is already live.\n\nEngine version 1 launches on the 1st of September 2022.\n\nSee our product demo here: https://www.loom.com/share/8152f63ee96846ebaa508fd65fffeba2\n\nEngine product outline: https://www.notion.so/metanomic/The-Economy-Engine-b6e3b6ca58a14669a8d420acc1727650\n\nThunderstruck product outline: https://www.notion.so/metanomic/Thunderstruck-AI-\n\nData connection catalogue (what kind of data our platform can handle): http://eventcatalog.metanomic.net/\n\nTech architecture map: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GslYHTg-B--5k_HMpcg7s0eRQdTurLU6ErVBhSuCogA/edit#slide=id.g10f846c6006\\_0\\_0\n\nOur primary focus now is to place these powerful tools into the hands of the Web3 creator economy by partnering with key metaverse players and platforms - like Decentraland.

Even once a brand gains a metaverse presence, it's hard to engage users in a fun, gamified experience.\n\nWe created a solution, gameplay to direct players to brand locations in Decentraland with smart-wearable technology. We incentivize players by giving tokens, in-game NFTs, and 3rd party NFT rewards for spending time exploring the brand’s virtual locations.\n\nThis is the way for everyone coming to Decentraland to have a good experience discovering new amazing places.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xf49056577a9266cd6CFd1B8f6ac151D9BB3671d7\n\n## Email address\n\njohnny.k@dapp-craft.com\n\n## Description\n\nDAPPCRAFT is the company behind the CROSSVERSE.\n\nCROSSVERSE is part of the play2earn incubation program from Decentraland for the past 5 months. We are asking for a grant to execute Phase II of the project.\n\n### Meet Hyp-0\n\nA cute digital pet that helps players to explore the metaverse and have fun!\n\nRecently Decentraland announced a new game asset – “smart wearable”. Hyp-0 is a creation of DAPPCRAFT's 5 months of deep research & development of this technology's capabilities.\n\nWe are convinced that he will inspire many other teams to create new unique experiences, like the one we do in CROSSVERSE.\n\n![Hyp-0](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/E-Yo5miolqhC-oSU8HTLjf8bb3uVg0LXIyLm4CPY3e8mtEmMlMb3rMUNhXmALYSY-Bc=w2400)\n\nHyp-0 takes different forms:\n\n*   Idle: Waits for commands from the player\n*   Navigate: Shows the direction to brand locations for the player in Decentraland\n*   Portal: Show the portal to the player which teleports close to brand locations\n*   Claim: The player charging highlighted zone and engaging with brand metaverse location.

We are one of the first OG wearables creators and first fashion week participants. We took participation in the creation of the first Emotes Decentraland (the most loved blow-head, for example). The others may know us for creating multiple unique experiences like the one we did for our clients and partners - the first animated mini-movie 12 minutes long for NASA to celebrate Apollo 11 mission with the first man on the [moon event](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-117%2C-50).\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### **PHASE II:**\n\nMilestone #1. 30 of October 2022.\n\n*   Private alpha release on mainnet only for DAPPCRAFT community. This includes quests and NFT incentives for players with claim functionality after quest completion.\n*   Partnerships with at least 3 land or district/estate owners.\n\nMilestone #2. 25 of December 2022.\n\n*   Beta version public release of Hyp-0 gameplay.\n*   MVP of the Laboratory portal where users can upgrade their Hyp-0s with properties and rarity levels.

Players will be able to boost their Hyp-0 with NFTs.\n*   PvP secret gameplay.\n*   More partnerships with land and district/estate owners\n\nWe can see CROSSVERSE as a successful business and an important part of metaverse development. Our business model is dependent on Decentraland success and it will take time to build a positive cash flow. For now, we have to rely on grants and investments. Its been almost a year since DAPPCRAFT started this project and invested a lot of time and resources into it.\n\nWhatever we do our core values are to explore limits and expanding the boundaries of what is possible. Inspire our friends, colleagues, and other industry pioneers.\n\nCROSSVERSE is just started. We have plenty of surprises in the future! At the moment we ask for community support.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7e4f37c0-0e65-11ed-9d53-7b405ea02bcb)**",

    "title": "Democratize Access to Decentraland for Renting, Marketing, and Hosting Events",
    "body": "> by 0x46c02de46629a2babe7c9ba1d9ebf0804d4f99aa\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nNearly three months ago, we launched a website to create a gallery feed of all properties available to rent across major metaverses such as Decentraland.\n\nThe project – called https://rentparcel.io/ – received a great response so far - 70+ property posts, 2k+ post views in 20+ countries despite very little marketing. We were also able to successfully connect multiple tenants with landlords and were even instrumental in facilitating rentals worth hundreds of dollars!\n\nWe are now requesting your support to turn this project into a full-fledged peer-to-peer marketplace in order to make Decentraland super accessible to the average person for renting, advertising, hosting events, etc.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x46c02dE46629a2bAbe7c9ba1D9EBF0804d4f99AA\n\n## Email address\n\nasaxena1415@yahoo.com\n\n## Description\n\nBased on our current website, land owners would submit their property posts along with a price and contact, and anyone interested would reach out to them and work the rental details out. We witnessed multiple potential tenants reaching out to us to learn more about the rental process as our website helped them connect with land owners. However, we also soon learned that Decentraland remains largely inaccessible to the average person looking to advertise, market their products, or celebrate/host events on it.\n\nWhile we were able to make the lands more discoverable through our platform, the process of actually using the land remains much more complicated. Decentraland allows land owners to grant temporary edit permissions to another user for their land (https://docs.decentraland.org/market/land-manager/#give-permissions) but in order for the tenants to work with it, they need to be well-versed with deploying code to build something in DCL. The problem is that in many cases the tenants don’t really need these permissions and just want to connect and work with the land owner on how they plan to use the land.\n\nThink of the following major use cases for example:\n\n1.  A production company wants to promote their upcoming film on someone’s land, they would like to directly ask the land owner to put up a poster or some other graphic on a particular asset on the land, for instance, a billboard. Or basically, any other company looking to advertise or market their product’s info on someone’s land.\n2.  A family wants to celebrate a birthday party or some other similar event in DCL, they want to use an existing parcel/estate without any changes and all they require is the land owner’s help to let them host the event.\n\nNeither of these above cases require the involvement of a smart contract or any sort of transfer of ownership or other permissions, and the whole process can be worked out simply by connecting and communicating with potential tenants. And so, RentParcel will build a platform that will make it extremely simple to connect with land owners for anyone who’s trying to utilize Decentraland but doesn’t have any advanced knowledge of crypto, nfts, or the metaverse.\n\nHow is this happening currently?\n\nCurrently, if potential customers want to connect with land owners they do it largely through Discord, Telegram, Twitter, and other social media sources, which is mostly unorganized. There are also metaverse real estate agents and advertising firms that act as middlemen or brokers for facilitating ‘rentals’. Our vision is to democratize access to Decentraland land and create a level playing field in terms of opportunities for land owners. By building a peer-to-peer marketplace, we would be able to have a single dedicated space where anyone can connect with DCL land owners, use their land, leave reviews, and just help make the entire process more open, accessible, and transparent.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nRentParcel will streamline the process of using someone’s land - we plan to model our website in the following manner:\n\n1.  For land owners: Land owners would go to our website and create a post for their property (wallet integration will not be mandatory) which will also include the price per day for using their land and the availability.\n\n2.  For customers (any person, entity, or organisation) looking to use DCL land for whatever their need is - renting, marketing, events, etc., would then browse through this website and select their property of interest and duration (for which they intend to use the land), and they will then request to communicate directly with the land owner.\n\nThe land owner will then get a notification that someone is interested in their land and it will be up to them to accept/reject the invite to initiate the conversation. Once the details such as price, duration, etc are finalized, RentParcel will let the land owner set a price and duration which would be then sent to the tenant customer to accept. The exact reason for using the land will be something that will be worked out between the two parties.\n\nIn addition, we will also include features that can be found on popularly existing marketplace like websites such as leaving reviews/ratings both for landlords and customers, searching, filtering on price, land type, size, etc.\n\nWe plan to use the requested funds for the following:\n\n1.  Accelerating the development of the project and creating informational content - we will hire more developers to expedite the completion of the project. We’ll also retain video editors to create educational content for both land owners and tenants on how to go about using space in DCL for hosting events or advertising.\n2.  Marketing - We will also retain an experienced and dedicated marketing personnel who would oversee search engine optimisation (SEO), design our online ads strategy, and handle social media engagement to help increase customer traction for the land owners.\n3.  Establishing Partnerships - We are currently focussed more on Decentraland and will work to partner with companies trying to bring experiences or replicating real world events in DCL by persuading them to use our platform so that land owners are benefited.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nAditya - Software Engineer\n\nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/saxena-aditya/\n\nGitHub - https://github.com/aditya800\n\nTave - Software Engineer, Computer Science degree from New York University.\n\nBoth of us are full stack software engineers with experience working at Microsoft & Amazon, and will be putting up to $1K USD collectively out of our own pocket too for the project.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe plan to complete the project within 8-10 weeks, here are the goals we’re setting:\n\n1.  Week 1-5: Software development. Upgrade the RentParcel website to have a login and communication system for land owners and customers, as well as the other UI changes highlighted under specification.\n2.  Week 5-6: Onboard potential customers, focus on marketing, and establishing partnerships.\n3.  Week 6-8: Beta testing and launch website.\n\nFollow the progress of the project on:\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7vPBgAtwz5\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RentParcel\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8a1e3180-0e3a-11ed-9d53-7b405ea02bcb)**",

We’ve successfully worked through all the challenges of streaming into the Decentraland for events of all shapes and sizes, and are now ready to take it to the next level.\n\nWe believe that streaming audio and video into Decentraland should be as easy as posting on Facebook, and as flexible as Lego blocks. With your support, we can provide the “remote” you need to drive content at scale with no limits, no buffering, and no jitter.\n\nWe need a Decentraland-first streaming platform that enables any streaming need, and one that can grow with our community.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xBb626c562D5b89961Eb2a2519e49d97D132189F7\n\n## Email address\n\njusten@serraform.com\n\n## Description\n\nStreaming limitless events with the best user experience requires global CDN networks with a massive amount of bandwidth that can scale in real-time; something most of us just don’t have access to. The answer is simply to harness the power of the cloud, efficiently and securely.\n\nWith a combined 30+ years of experience in cloud consulting with some of the largest fortune 500 companies through infrastructure, development, automation, and cybersecurity. Not to mention we’re a strong player within the community – Serraform is uniquely positioned to deliver a self-service video streaming platform for Decentraland that is fully-automated and simple to use.\n\nWith your support, we plan to further invest in the development of a streaming platform hosted in the cloud and secured with state-of-the-art cybersecurity and compliant solutions. To do this we need to take what we’ve learned and built so far and automate its ability to service you at a moment’s notice. We need the service to scale beyond what our team can manage and let anybody use it themselves when they want, while reducing overall running costs for the community.\n\nWe need to develop an interface and an API that can be used for any parcel owner to leverage the power of our streaming platform, allowing the ability for users to upload any audio/video file for streaming, or copy/paste in a Twitch/YouTube stream URL for those who prefer that route. We also know the community wants to broadcast Zoom podcasts or OBS streams directly into Decentraland but lack the ability to do it at scale and without jitter – we've been servicing all these use-cases, and now we need to package it up in a simple to use service for anybody to use on their own time. Simply upload your video, paste your link, or request a RTMP URL/key and let the fully automated service handle the rest.\n\nIf you’re a developer you might build an interface inside Decentraland or within your own tool if you prefer not to use ours, then leverage our API to deliver on the streaming magic for you. Rent out your venue and allow guests to control their content natively inside your own parcel. Have a club night where your VIP guests control the stream via Twitch or a jukebox collection of content over a stream deck you built! The possibilities will be endless, and this is just the beginning.\n\n**Feature highlights PowerPoint:** https://tinyurl.com/5b58ccx9\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe plan to develop this solution on Microsoft Azure cloud using fully automated code to provision isolated streaming “tenants” using modern DevOps practices. We believe the solution should be cloud-native and have no single points of failure or need for manual intervention, while being able to deliver on your security and compliance needs with maximum horsepower and optimum user experience across the globe.\n\nIn addition to our proposed website UI, we plan to develop an API ‘under the hood’ to allow 3rd party app integration, allowing anybody to integrate their own parcel and control preferences with our streaming solution, either in-game or through 3rd party tooling or websites. **Why not build your own jukebox collection and let party-goers control your screens within your parcel? Imagine building a stream deck inside your venue!**\n\nThe content will be encoded with H.264 studio-grade quality up to 1080p, optimized for Decentraland events, and securely stored using Microsoft’s award-winning Defender security toolset. The streams will be provided as adaptive M3U8 streams, meaning various bitrates and resolutions will be available, accommodating any bandwidth limitations – this basically means **you get a buffer-free experience on every stream at the best quality possible anywhere and on any device**.\n\nThe service will support ingestion of any external stream (via OBS or Zoom for example) using an RTMP URL/key pair, but also **be able to broadcast streams directly from Twitch and/or YouTube** if you already have a URL.\n\nWe plan to leverage Verizon’s global premium CDN network allowing for dedicated content delivery to anybody around the world at very low latency and zero buffering. We want to be able to ingest any video source, and re-broadcast it directly into Decentraland, providing a **great viewing experience for over 1700+ user events.

    "title": "Allow Custom Minting Amounts for Wearables",
    "body": "> by 0x9381caa558f19a821a2360c59fdf3db60c09ff52 (JTV)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[NFT Mint Amount Options](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f78ecc00-ee39-11ec-aa01-87bd234b340d)\n\n## Summary\n\nSummary\nRemove current minting rarity tier system and allow for all possible mint numbers up to 100,000.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nCurrently, when uploading wearables creators are locked into choosing rarity tiers that specify a fixed mint amount. This limits the ability to release collections that would benefit from a more nuanced number (i.e., 50, 2500, 1999). A workaround involves minting greater than needed then burning the excess. I aim to allow for a simplified process from the start.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDecentraland (DCL) is the only NFT marketplace that does not allow for custom minting amounts. Considering other platforms allow this flexibility, I feel DCL should also allow this basic feature. As a prolific publisher, I at times struggle to choose an appropriate rarity tier for my items. The most common tiers used, Legendary, Epic, and Rare, have mint amounts spread to far apart, 100, 1000, and 5000 respectively. Currently the rarity tiers are:\n\nUnique: 1\n\nMythic: 10\n\nLegendary: 100\n\nEpic: 1000\n\nRare: 5000\n\nUncommon: 10,000\n\nCommon: 100,000\n\nThe two methods to circumvent this restrictive system are:\n\n1.)\tTo create and burn excess mints.\n\n2.)\tCreate your own contract and go through the Linked Wearables Registry.\n\nThere are a few issues with those. To create and burn causes undue burden for the creator and the network. Further, depending on how many are burned, invalidates the rarity color system. With Linked Wearables, this option is less-than-often applicable to the intent of the publisher. Linked wearables have no rarity designation and are not able to be sold or traded within DCL. They are simply DCL representations of External NFTs you may already own.\nAs you can see the current system leaves much to be desired.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nI propose removing the minting tiers system and to allow the publisher to specify any number of mints, up to a maximum of 100,000.  This will enable creators to choose custom mint amounts specific to their own needs, while also keeping a high maximum on possible mints.\n\nUpon submitting a request to publish a wearable, the user will specify the maximum number of mints for the item instead of specifying a rarity tier.  Legacy values from the tier system can be used as suggested guidelines or defaults.\\\nThe wearables submission page, rarity fields in the builder, and wearable smart contracts will be updated by the DCL development team in order to accommodate the new system.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy enabling Creators and Publishers to have greater freedom of their collections through expanding the minting amount options, DCL will benefit from increased creativity and expression. This is a simple change to bring DCL to parity to other platforms and encourage continued user growth.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d31b5630-0db1-11ed-92a2-218eab5ea42b)**",

    "title": "Creation of DAO-Owned Data Aggregation Layer for Decentraland Core",
    "body": "> by 0xe400a85a6169bd8be439bb0dc9eac81f19f26843 (howieDoin)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe believe Decentraland player usage data should be collected by the DAO and made available to all Decentraland users.\n\nUser location data is currently available through use of the /islands endpoint on DCL content server nodes. This information can be collected periodically (e.g. every few seconds) and stored in a database to be served up via API queries available to the Decentraland community. It is not feasible for multiple parties to independently collect this information as it would cause undue strain on Decentraland infrastructure.\n\nThis data should be collected and owned by the DAO, and therefore be owned by Decentraland’s users and not a private company or individual.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n57,300 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe64581F067Cfdce58657E3c0F58175e638C30f2B\n\n## Email address\n\nhowie@atlascorp.io\n\n## Description\n\n**Why collect this data and make it available?**\n\nAs Atlas CORP has been in the analytics business for 18 months, we know that there are some immediate benefits that could be recognized by the Decentraland community through the creation of this service:\n\n**1. \tGrow the number of successful Decentraland Builders**\n\nMove the conversation from “why Decentraland?” to “why your use case?” for builders looking to win clients or raise funds.\n\nProviding high level Decentraland statistics will increase the growth and success of builders. Often the first question asked of teams looking to build or sell in Decentraland focuses on the metaverse itself and not the team’s use case; although Decentraland is the most decentralized metaverse it still exists in a competitive landscape. Investors and clients often need to justify investment or choice of metaverse before they can start to focus on a team’s specific use case.\n\nBy providing data on Daily Active Users, Total User Growth of Decentraland, and traffic by parcel, builders can refer to these open source analytics instead of each team attempting to obtain them by themselves.\n\n**2. \tPrevent undue load on Decentraland Infrastructure**\n\nWhile the data in question is public, everyone cannot query this data for themselves without an adverse impact on Decentraland nodes.\n\nThere has already been discussion in the forums about shutting down external access to player position data due to increased loads felt by Decentraland content server nodes. Too many concurrent requests to these endpoints would have the effect of a DDoS attack which could impact the quality of the service each node can provide.\n\nTherefore instead of a) playing out the Tragedy of the Commons that would occur if everyone collected the data for themselves, b) removing access such that nobody can benefit from this data, or c) allowing the data to be acquired by the highest bidder/private entity – we believe the ecosystem will benefit most from the data collection being done once and everyone sharing in access to that data.\n\n**3. \tPrevent Private Monopolization of the Data**\n\nWe at Atlas CORP have first-hand knowledge of how valuable this data can be to those operating in Decentraland. User position data can be used to determine how many users attended events – critical for event hosts to understand how well their event performed. Daily active user data is crucial to those seeking to invest in the metaverse to help understand returns on investment.\n\nWe believe that no private institution should be able to gate-keep this information from the rest of the community. We at Atlas CORP used to make this information freely available using our own private hosting infrastructure, but we outpaced our capacity requiring a move to more dynamic scaling solutions. This is why we’re here talking about this proposal.\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nThe DAO can provide the Decentraland community a free source of user data via API for up to one year for the cost of $57,300. The existence of this data set will help to grow the builder and entrepreneurial community by providing important metrics needed to win clients and funding, and prevent monopolization by private entities. Atlas CORP is the suitable candidate for this development given an extensive history in Decentraland data collection and analytics.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**What Data is in Scope?**\n\nThis proposal is only for Decentraland user data as reported by the /comms/islands endpoint on Decentraland Content Servers.\n\nThis proposal does NOT include:\n\n*   Content Server data (e.g. scene files, user profile history)\n*   Scene-specific data (e.g. object clicks and interactions)\n*   Any personally identifiable information (PII), excluding ETH wallet address\n*   User IRL location data\n*   Any derived content from a user’s ETH wallet\n\nData will be collected from all active, registered Decentraland Content Servers which at the time of writing includes hephaestus, hela, heimdallr, baldr, loki, dg, odin, unicorn, marvel, and athena.\n\nThis data set can provide a platform for building more sophisticated reports by the DCL developer community. The DAO could also choose to one day monetize access to this data (e.g. when the data is being used directly for profit), as well as augment what data is collected and made available. It is important to note that this proposal is currently limited in scope to the one data set and free access to the community, and that these next steps may be the subject of future proposals.\n\n**How will this work?**\n\nData will be collected every 20 seconds and piped into a Mongo Atlas cloud database, with a Digital Ocean server set up to provide API access to queries on the data.\n\nAn automated feed will be set up to collect data from an authoritative source of each active DAO node. Collecting data every 20 seconds will result in 3 datapoints a minute; graphs using one-minute granularity will have 3 datapoints on which to aggregate data points per minute. Data collection will be set up redundantly on two or more servers, or on a single load-balanced cluster, to minimize downtime in data collection. This data is expected to grow at 1Gb per day, which may accelerate with the growth of daily active users.\n\nAs the data is natively in JSON, we propose to use Mongo Atlas as the cloud database of choice. The database will also be deployed with multiple nodes to minimize downtime. Mongo provides an easy way to scale for future needs – whether through increasing storage capacity or sharding the deployment for increased API and query load.\n\nTo minimize infrastructure costs, we propose keeping only 3 months of data available for public consumption. A process will be designed to backup, purge, and post/host historical data such that users can perform historical analysis without excessive cost to the DAO.\n\nAn API server will be written to provide simplified API access to the data in the database. These queries may include things like – users per minute (global or per parcel), daily active users (global or per parcel), and unique Decentraland visitors (global or per parcel). The API code can be made open source and hosted on GitLab, but hosted privately on Digital Ocean to prevent unauthorized access to the DAO’s database. Additional access can be granted to additional DAO representatives if deemed appropriate.\n\nAPI access will remain open, although a throttling mechanism will be put in place per IP address to prevent DDoS of the API servers. In addition, query data (e.g. who’s asking for what) could be saved in the database and made available as APIs for complete transparency.\n\nA dashboard will be made available to show recent Decentraland population data and daily active users for the reportable data set.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe Development Team\n\nThe development of this data platform would be done by the Atlas Corporation [@atlascorp_dcl](https://twitter.com/AtlasCorp_dcl) team, who have extensive experience working with this data set:\n\n*   HowieDoin – Lead Analytics & Infrastructure innovation\n*   MorrisMustang – Lead DCL & Solidity innovation\n*   JosephAaron – Operations and task management\n*   StaleDegree – Senior Solidity/UI Development\n*   RyanNFT – Junior Developer\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**What will this cost the Decentraland DAO?**\n\nThis project will cost the DAO $57,300 and will take approximately 3 months to develop.\n\nThis breaks down into:\n\n**$7,500.00**\\* **- Infrastructure and Hosting Costs:**\n\n*   Budget for Mongo Atlas DB for one year\n*   Budget for Digital Ocean API servers for one year\n*   Budget for Digital Ocean Data collection servers for one year\n*   ENS domain for three years\n\n\\**This estimate is based on current pricing for each of the above platforms. $7,500 may not last a full year if pricing is altered by the provider.*\n\n**$45,000.00- Development Costs (estimated 3 month delivery)**\n\n*   Data collection with redundancy and failover to set up the data collection\n    rails\n*   API query development resources to produce queries and prevent\n    overuse\n*   DevOps and infrastructure development resources to automate as much\n    as possible\n*   Technical Writing resources to provide user-facing API documentation\n*   Front-end development resources to create the dashboard\n\n**$4,800 - Ongoing Support Costs (3 months post deployment)**\n\n*   Code updates when breaking changes occur due to external forces\n*   API query user support in the Decentraland discord\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=66d76070-0d27-11ed-92a2-218eab5ea42b)**",

    "body": "> by 0x1e105bb213754519903788022b962fe2b9c4b263 (Bay#b263)\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nVueltta is an international art collective creating immersive experiences in Decentraland. We will present our new Decentraland project ‘The Labyrinth Effect’ to a major audience of global artists and brands at NFT Show Europe.\n\nThe Labyrinth Effect is currently self-funded and will happen with or without this grant. But, as independent artists and designers, we’d greatly appreciate DAO support towards build and exhibition costs. The Labyrinth Effect will be an important demonstration of Decentraland’s creative potential to an audience of leading digital artists, brands and investors.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n4,600 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x1e105bb213754519903788022b962fe2B9C4B263\n\n## Email address\n\nbay@vueltta.com\n\n## Description\n\n**‘The Labyrinth Effect’** is a new series of immersive Decentraland installations and events by art collective [Vueltta](https://vueltta.com/). Visitors are invited to explore ‘The Tower Labyrinth’ and ‘The Pyramid Labyrinth’, two large-scale installations across two Decentraland locations. Inside each labyrinth, visitors will experience contemporary art in an entirely new way.\n\nFirst coined by researcher Dr. John Rhodes in 2006, ‘The Labyrinth Effect’ describes the states of mind evoked by walking a labyrinth. According to Rhodes, labyrinths create liminal spaces which promote ‘flashes of intuition, insight and openness’.\n\n**Vueltta’s labyrinths seek to bring this liminal experience into the metaverse.**\n\n*‘Labyrinths are an ancient archetype dating back 4,000 years or more.  They evoke metaphor, sacred geometry, spiritual pilgrimage… and community building’*\n— The Labyrinth Society\n\nYou can see more on the design of the installations in [our slide deck here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DUveBN37F0uI5UsIhEbF5zGrc73sSpX0/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Motivation 1: DCL Beyond 'NFTs in Frames'**\n\nAs an art collective, Vueltta’s aim is to use art installation and interactive technologies to explore how shared virtual experience will shape society and identity. As artists, we’re committed to using Decentraland to find new dimensions for contemporary art.\n\nWe believe creative teams like ours can go far beyond ‘NFTs in frames’ to provide immersive experiences - engaging new audiences both with art and with Decentraland. These ‘non-gaming’ experiences have significance for brands, artists and creative agencies evaluating their entry into the metaverse.\n\n**Motivation 2: Engage a wider creative community with DCL**\n\nThe Labyrinth Effect will be presented at [NFT Show Europe](https://nftshoweurope.com/) to some of the most important digital artists working today. These include [Zancan](https://twitter.com/zancan), [Kim Asendorf](https://twitter.com/kimasendorf), [AL Crego](https://twitter.com/ALCrego\\_), [VNCCII](https://twitter.com/VNCCII_OFFICIAL), [Loackme](https://twitter.com/loackme\\_) and [Tim Maxwell](https://twitter.com/maxwellinked). It will also be seen by Hide Uehara, Director of business development for [Square Enix](https://twitter.com/SquareEnix), the Japanese conglomerate behind [Final Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy), as well as brands like [EssilorLuxottica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EssilorLuxottica).\n\nThe conference organisers expect at least 900 visitors. The Labyrinth Effect will be live-streamed into the exhibition hall of the event, where Vueltta artists will demonstrate the project and assist new users. We are also confirmed to present the project on a main conference stage.\n\nTo engage the NFT Europe Show audience further we plan several live events over the show dates. These will also be publicised on DCL discords and open to all:\n\n*   Guided Labyrinth Walks with Vueltta Artists\n*   Labyrinth Flash Mobs\n\nVideo and photography from these events will be shared across social media. The team's previous events gained 250+ visitors/week through social media promotion alone. We expect visitor data to be much higher when combined with our NFT Show Europe presence, and will report all figures back to the DAO.\n\nFilm and photography from The Labyrinth Effect will be used in presentations for future creative industry summits.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Labyrinth Effect will be designed and built by Vueltta, then deployed by our land collaborators.\n\nWe have already confirmed our collaborations for the two build locations:\n\n**Indie Village - location for The Tower Labyrinth**\n\nLand collaboration by [Bill Burns](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-burns-86505059/), gallery build by [KJ Walker](https://www.lowpolymodelsworld.com/)\n\n[Indie Village](https://play.decentraland.org/?island=I4zft\\&position=100%2C30\\&realm=dg) is a 20-acre master-planned virtual development that aims to become the premier cultural destination of the metaverse.  Partnered with NIVA (National Independent Venue Association), Indie Village brings real-world venues to life in Decentraland - beginning with a series of benefit shows in late summer 2022. Indie Village will be activated on a nightly basis with live concerts, art galleries, comedy clubs, fashion shows, social clubs and numerous other immersive virtual experiences.  With a special mission to support women and the arts, Indie Village is currently hosting ‘Infinite Objects presents Women of the World’, an exhibition showcasing the art of 130 female artists from all over the globe.

    "body": "> by 0x87956abc4078a0cc3b89b419928b857b8af826ed (Nacho)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Manage Bounty program for vulnerability reports](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=09aad6c0-0471-11ed-8a2f-a1a061d4350b)\n\n## Summary\n\nRequest the DAO to cover the payment of the rewards and grant the Decentraland Foundation to manage them as the proposal state.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nAs the DAO owns the smart contracts and manages the development of the protocol, we are requesting to cover the rewards needed for every vulnerability found in the Decentraland bounty program. The Decentraland foundation is committed to triage, answering, and fixing every disclosure received. Every payment will be published publicly.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nBug bounty programs are open invitations to security researchers to discover and disclose potential vulnerabilities in projects’ smart contracts and applications, thereby protecting projects and their users. For their good work, security researchers receive a reward based on the severity of the vulnerability, as determined by the project affected.\n\nWhy have a bug bounty program at all? In 2020 alone, hacks and scams cost the Web3 community over $238m, and bug bounties can prevent those hacks from happening. Bug bounty programs surface vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before they get exploited in malicious hacks that destroy projects and ruin reputations.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAs members of the Security Advisory Board (SAB), we hereby request the DAO to approve and fund the bounty program and due to its nature and limited execution capabilities, delegate to the Decentraland Foundation the ability to respond to any vulnerability disclosed through the program. That means that the Decentraland Foundation is committed to doing the triage and answering the disclosures received, while the DAO is in charge of providing the funds needed once a confirmed bug report is reviewed and confirmed. So basically when a payment has to happen due to a valid report under the program, the Decentraland Foundation will inform DAO with case #, the recipient wallet address, and the amount to be paid and also, shall contact the SAB in order to fix the vulnerabilities disclosed.\n\nThe program is composed of different threat levels and topics:\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nHigh\t\t\t\t\t       **Up to USD 500 000**\n\nMedium\t\t\t                **Up to USD 20 000**\n\nLow\t\t\t\t\t        **USD 1 000**\n\n**Websites and Applications**\n\nCritical\t\t\t\t       **USD 18 000**\n\nHigh\t\t\t\t               **USD 6 000**\n\nMedium\t\t\t\t       **USD 3 000**\n\nLow\t\t\t\t\t       **USD 1 000**\n\nPayouts are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in **MANA and USDT**, with a minimum of 20% to be done in USDT.\n\nThe program is not tied or attached to any third party but the Decentraland Foundation will use them and their expertise and platforms to help administrate the program. Therefore and after a deep initial analysis, the SAB has selected and recommended the Decentraland Foundation to start the bounty program using [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/).\n\nThe Decentraland bounty program can be found [here](https://immunefi.com/bounty/decentraland/).\n\nThe DAO will publish each payment made for every reward.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nDecentraland will continue working on its security by encouraging white hackers to participate in the bounty program.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nFor transparency, the Decentraland Foundation will provide a report about the vulnerabilities accepted including the disclosure date, description, and fixed date.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe idea is to keep Decentraland safe and secure for every user. The DAO will provide the funds while the Foundation will manage the disclosures accordingly\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c4b83ba0-0c3d-11ed-92a2-218eab5ea42b)**",

    "body": "> by 0xb7c0dc404c2ce1b2226c709eca6d8479b1fb80dc (test#80dc)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nVideo streaming in Decentraland has a 10-20 sec delay causing interactive video apps to be infeasible.  Sub 1 sec streaming is set to grow significantly over 5 years for apps in education, media and entertainment.\n\nFacebook's metaverse is built with Ultra Low Latency at its core. Decentraland is MISSING this feature. **Let's fix this!!**\n\n### Video of working prototype\n\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/ml7nlTEk3p8/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml7nlTEk3p8)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml7nlTEk3p8\n\nGrant is to complete development to Dcl's dev standards.\n\n### About me\n\n*   Expert in low latency remote control systems, IoT and WebRtc\n*   4x CTO. Delivered over 500 software projects.\n*   857 Github commits in last year\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n48,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC8Fede4B21b462b1b5fEB0AcFC0513012B1795F8\n\n## Email address\n\nlowlatencydcl@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nDid you know, communication with astronauts on Earth’s moon has a latency (delay) of 1.25 seconds?\n\nDue to the protocols used, live video in the Decentraland world is delayed at around 10-20 seconds. This makes live events infeasible. For example, live video calls or interactive events take 20 seconds to get a response.\n\nThis project introduces new ultra low latency streaming components to the decentraland SDK and builder to support ultra low latency video. Latency will reduce to ~1 second.\n\nThese components will allow scene builders to easily incorporate ultra low latency video in their scenes.\n\n### Background\n\nIn recent years, global investment in technology and infrastructure underlying ultra low latency video streaming has been significant.  Live streaming is set to explode in the coming years with low latency video being a big driver behind new applications in entertainment, gaming, media, education, acedemia.\n\nUltra low latency video streaming typically operates on a sub 1 second delay.\nThis project will integrate this hot, deep technology into the Decentraland platform.\n\n### Competitive Advantage\n\nMetaverses such as Facebook's Meta already have native low-latency video\nand are building a strong portfolio of apps based on this technology. Other\nMetaverses do not yet have low latency video streaming technology.\n\n### Experimental Prototype\n\nA video demonstration of the components I have developed is here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ml7nlTEk3p8\n\nThis video shows a working prototype of an experimental Decentraland SDK component featuring a low latency video stream.\n\nThe video is streaming from North America to a video streaming server in Hong Kong (on Microsoft Azure) and then back to North America and into a Decentraland scene running in the browser.\n\nThe clock times on the right side are the current time whereas the time on the left, in the Decentraland scene, are latent due to the transit time around the planet and the subsequent decoding and rendering of the video.\n\nTotal time is demonstrated to be around 1 second.\n\nA 5 year old laptop with no GPU was used for the test. The video resolution is set to 640x360.\n\nThe experimental prototype includes modifications to the Decentraland Unity Renderer and Kernel and adds a new video component to the SDK.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\nIt is difficult to imagine a virtual future that runs on a 20 second delay.  Use cases that need lower latency might include:\n\n*   Any live interaction such as video calls.\n*   Live events where people communicate from the virtual world to the real world.\n*   Any use cases that include augmentation of the virtual world with a real object (augmented virtuality).\n*   Virtual workspaces\n*   Virtual learning spaces that requires interaction\n*   Remote control of real world devices such as drones. (yikes!)\n*   Immersive commerce\n*   Gaming applications\n\n### Existing DAO pre-Proposal\n\nAn existing pre-proposal that covers this feature is here, from Tobik#7989. Note however this is a request for a protocol change, the proposed feature would likely be an additional component so that backwards compatibility is maintained:\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0627a110-2fd6-11ec-ac84-77607720a240\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### High Level Summary\n\nThe project objective is to create a feature to enable scene builders to easily incorporate low latency video into their scenes. To be successful the feature needs to be well engineered, tested, documented, incorporate ideas from dev and user communities and comply with Decentraland standards.\n\n### Deliverables\n\n*   Deliver WebRTC ultra low video and audio streaming components to the Decentraland SDK.\n*   Support for Decentraland web client and feasibility of development on new Desktop client on supported platforms.\n*   Complete all relevant requirement, archiectural, design, code, test and deployment work to decentraland's standard via github.\n*   Run relevant user testing and trials.\n*   Operate a streaming test server until mid November 2022 for development and community testing.\n*   Create test scenes, sdk documentations, blogs and assist Decentraland marketing team on new feature launch.\n*   Be responsive to community and be present in relevant channel on Discord.\n*   Attend some sweet dcl live events that use the new technology.\n\n### Preliminary Work Completed\n\nA feasibility study was completed prior to grant application request:\n\n*   Talking to potential users and understanding their applications.\n*   Review of code and relevant architectural components.\n*   Reading Dcl code standards and architecture documentation.\n*   Research of ECS (sdk) structure and dev of new components.\n*   Review of existing decentraland video components.\n*   Review of WebRTC options for Unity and their pros and cons.\n*   Building new environment across Explorer, Kernel and Unity Renderer.

    "body": "> by 0x3026e5dca7a3f50a482d5f06fb18ce607386531b (SirDropBear)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Custome Spawn Locations](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7c50f0f0-0508-11ed-8a2f-a1a061d4350b)\n\n## Summary\n\ninstead of spawning only in genesis plaza you can spawn where ever you set it to.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nMyself and alot of the community would like to spawn in different locations aside genesis plaza. I think it would be great to be able to spawn at any place on the map.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAlways spawning in genesis plaza can get rather boring and sometimes it would be nice to be able to spawn else where. I imagine having a house on a parcel and being able to spawn there when i load the client so it feels you load into your home within Decentraland. Or even spawn at a favourite location.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nthe developers of DCL could impliment this feature\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nBest case scenario, you can set a location to where you will spawn in. Instead of Genesis plaza.\n\nMid case Scenario: Being able to spawn at the location you logged off or last visited.\n\nSo many of the community love griding various games and would love to spawn there.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThis should be fairly easy for the decentraland development team to impliment into the client. from feedback in the forums last location may be easeier. It would be prefered for custome spawns but last location will be great also. alot of people are just bored of genesis plaza. Its great for new players but for seasoned players its very boring.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion i believe that this feature is much needed and feel it can be implimented easily to the decentraland client.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=56f742e0-0aef-11ed-92a2-218eab5ea42b)**",

    "body": "> by 0x776b3b6238cb38b55c7492824318adafa1e6fa45\n\nShould the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe aim to produce an Arabic Youtube series of 12 videos, 7-10 mins long. We plan to cover three main themes: Decentraland, The Metaverse and Economic Potential for MENA.\n\nSample: https://bit.ly/3z1GvPr\n\nMetaverse:\n\n*   What is the Metaverse?\n*   Variety / Types of Games\n*   Big Players (Gaming Companies / Celebrities)\n*   Guilds, Alliances and Aggregators\n*   Future and Wider Adoption\n\nDecentraland:\n\n*   History (foundation, development, milestones, investors)\n*   Beginner Guide to Decentraland (map, activities, land purchase, marketplace)\n*   Decentraland Builder\n*   Biggest events hosted in Decentraland\n\nEconomic Potential:\n\n*   P2E models / Impact on developing countries\n*   MENA & The Metaverse (overview, obstacles, opportunities)\n*   Virtual Real Estate\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x776b3b6238CB38b55c7492824318ADAFA1e6fa45\n\n## Email address\n\ncontact@taxir.xyz\n\n## Description\n\nOpportunity\n\nThe Metaverse and GameFi spheres offer a rare opportunity for the gaming communities around the world to monetize their efforts and expertise, and MENA (Middle East & North Africa) is home to diverse and rich communities based around gaming, streaming and internet cultures.\n\nProblem\n\nMENA remains to be the globe's slowest region in terms of blockchain adoption, despite its young and online population making for a fertile adoption ground. This is due to slow regulatory adoption in some countries, poor adoption of online payment technology, and weak communication and localization infrastructure.\n\nWe aim to tackle the third issue.\n\nSolution\n\nWe want to develop a high quality Arabic Youtube series, targeting Arab gaming communities, and educating them on three topics: 1) The Metavers / GameFi sector, 2) Decentraland, 3) Economic potential of the P2E model and other models to the residents of MENA.\n\nThe series will consist of 12 videos, ranging between 7 - 10 minutes.\n\nThe first six videos will focus on the Metaverse in general, starting with what is the Metaverse and how it works, then moving to the concept of Ecosystem and how different Metaverses have different rich ecosystems of gamers and builders. We will go through the big players in the Metaverse sphere so far, including the biggest Metaverse projects, biggest gaming companies entering the field, specially ones that are popular in MENA (e.g. Ubisoft), as well as celebrities and artists entering the field and developing their own virtual project.\n\nWe will then proceed to talk about the most prominent milestones that the industry has gone through so far, whether on the levels of adoption or development. We will explore collaborative and collective initiatives emerging in the sphere, such as guilds, alliances and aggregators, and lastly, we will offer an overview on the future of the Metaverse and potential of wider adoption.\n\nIn the second part of the series, which will consist of three videos, we will explore Decentraland as an entry point to gamers and builders alike to the Metaverse sphere. We will cover Decentraland's history, then explore in one video from a player's prospective, and in an other video from developer's prospective.\n\nThe last three videos will revolve around the economic potential of the Metaverse and GameFi for MENA residents. We will cover three main pillars of the Metaverse economy: Play-to-Earn models, virtual events and tours, and the virtual real estate market.\n\nGoals\n\n1- Raise awareness about the Metaverse and GameFi and their economic potential amongst MENA's gaming communities.\n2- Introduce Decentraland as an entry point to the Metaverse / GameFi sphere to MENA users.\n3- Provide a series that can serve as a reference point for Arabic videos that delve into the Metaverse with more details.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe have already produced a sample video for the series. With the grant, we will be able to add a second camera and better lighting:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/axwltB17CdA\n\nWe have script drafts for four videos of the series, all in Arabic, which you can preview here:\n\nIntroduction to the Metaverse:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1-d2q5AUvCSLcPu--CXOc_gsy4AVashoYRr_EhkRpZ7Q/edit\n\nIntroduction to Decentraland:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1qsIh139wph_xls5dUuNFhxyDVqQd8mdZCGV4jH4qSeM/edit\n\nIntroduction to GameFi:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/14gZjue0rdqWnQonkoZ37NI2eZrcG0L7unO_i43HYdXs/edit\n\nGameFi economic potential for MENA:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hc4wkJG3hfQOQcUlJ1VdcoWNvbUOK7hkdzbDnj7AVss/edit\n\nSample of Taxir's previous video production, a course on 'Discord for Communicating Blockchain':\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKTAxsbcmCpe0pq_jGXSyhev7rwrNJttB\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nAmmar Manla Hasan.

The original map of 301x301 parcels was great to bootstrap the project by generating LAND scarcity, but it’s already too small for our community. What’s worse, many LANDs are in the hands of speculators who will never deploy content to the world.\n\nMy proposed solution? Continuous LAND issuance. Every day, or every week, the protocol can auction a new LAND, and the highest bidder can spawn a new LAND at any coordinate adjacent to an already existing one. If nobody wants to bid, no LAND is created for that period. Believe it or not, this was the original scheme for LAND issuance, and how the first testnet worked. Yes, this would reduce prices for already existing LANDs, but… if only whales can buy LANDs, other metaverses will kill Decentraland and your LAND will be worthless. Let’s make Genesis City the first of many cities in Decentraland!\n\nThis is an initial poll to gather community sentiment on this (potentially sensitive) topic. If this passes, I'll work on a more detailed proposal for the continuous issuance model. If you have any questions, feedback, or you agree but you don't think the timing is right, please leave a comment!\n\nSo... would you support some sort of continuous LAND issuance?\n\n- yes\n- no\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1c24a240-06ba-11ed-8a2f-a1a061d4350b)**",

We started by helping artist turn their work into nfts. This would be our first successful collection, with plans to develop many more wearables. We have dabbled with generative art via the hashlips art engine. We feel smaller batch, higher quality is the way to go. Our first NFT that we designed is a 3D spinning cube with Gonzo in the middle. It is a unique 1 of 1. Whomever holds this NFT unlocks its special content, which is free website.\nWe made a few other random nfts before we really understood the concept of NFT collections, as we are not trying to get rich. We are a small design studio, but we'd love this opportunity to help expand the virtual frontier.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nIt gives us no greater pleasure than to help usher in the future of design and technology. We are a small but passionate studio. Ever since ocarina of time we have had a strong interest in gaming and 3d. As technology evolves so must businesses. Our firm primarily does web design and content creation, and we'd like to move all of our processes to the metaverse. On top of that, we are super nerds. Our overall goal is to expand brand awareness to the metaverse. By establishing an office that dual functions as a store and meeting place, we plan to develop a community that is fun, inclusive, and the best dressed avatars in DCL. At the end of the day we love to make cool shit on computers.

    "title": "Manage Bounty program for vulnerability reports",
    "body": "> by 0x87956abc4078a0cc3b89b419928b857b8af826ed (Nacho)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Set up a bounty program for vulnerability reports](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c8c8ee20-fee5-11ec-8f44-ef1722f0509f)\n\n## Summary\n\nRequest the DAO to cover the payment of the rewards and grant the Decentraland Foundation to manage them as the proposal state.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nAs the DAO owns the smart contracts and manages the development of the protocol, we are requesting to cover the rewards needed for every vulnerability found in the Decentraland bounty program. The Decentraland foundation is committed to triage, answering, and fixing every disclosure received. Every payment will be published publicly.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nBug bounty programs are open invitations to security researchers to discover and disclose potential vulnerabilities in projects’ smart contracts and applications, thereby protecting projects and their users. For their good work, security researchers receive a reward based on the severity of the vulnerability, as determined by the project affected.\n\nWhy have a bug bounty program at all? In 2020 alone, hacks and scams cost the Web3 community over $238m, and bug bounties can prevent those hacks from happening. Bug bounty programs surface vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before they get exploited in malicious hacks that destroy projects and ruin reputations.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAs members of the Security Advisory Board (SAB), we hereby request the DAO to approve and fund the bounty program and due to its nature and limited execution capabilities, delegate to the Decentraland Foundation the ability to respond to any vulnerability disclosed through the program. That means that the Decentraland Foundation is committed to doing the triage and answering the disclosures received, while the DAO is in charge of providing the funds needed once a confirmed bug report is reviewed and confirmed. So basically when a payment has to happen due to a valid report under the program, the Decentraland Foundation will inform DAO with case #, the recipient wallet address, and the amount to be paid and also, shall contact the SAB in order to fix the vulnerabilities disclosed.\n\nThe program is composed of different threat levels and topics:\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nHigh\t\t\t\t\t       **Up to USD 500 000**\n\nMedium\t\t\t                **Up to USD 20 000**\n\nLow\t\t\t\t\t        **USD 1 000**\n\n**Websites and Applications**\n\nCritical\t\t\t\t       **USD 18 000**\n\nHigh\t\t\t\t               **USD 6 000**\n\nMedium\t\t\t\t       **USD 3 000**\n\nLow\t\t\t\t\t       **USD 1 000**\n\nPayouts are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in **MANA and USDT**, with a minimum of 20% to be done in USDT.\n\nThe program is not tied or attached to any third party but the Decentraland Foundation will use them and their expertise and platforms to help administrate the program. Therefore and after a deep initial analysis, the SAB has selected and recommended the Decentraland Foundation to start the bounty program using [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/).\n\nThe Decentraland bounty program can be found [here](https://immunefi.com/bounty/decentraland/).\n\nThe DAO will publish each payment made for every reward.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe idea is to keep Decentraland safe and secure for every user. The DAO will provide the funds while the Foundation will manage the disclosures accordingly\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=09aad6c0-0471-11ed-8a2f-a1a061d4350b)**",

To play it, you don't need to have special skills; you can be an adult or a child, which means that there's a considerable amount of potential players. Playing D\\&D is captivating. Furthermore, it is no less intriguing to watch others play it, which means that the game can have great success on platforms such as Twitch, YouTube, etc. It means a tremendous advertisement for Decentraland that will bring a lot of new users, and new users equal the advancement of Decentraland.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n90,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2e09A10eaAcE1Ef3a66FbF6F1F782C8c0cb8c942\n\n## Email address\n\ncenmodelscontact@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe name of our organization is CEN. Link to our website https://cenmodels.com\nEach member of our team has been working in game development for many years. We sincerely love games and our work. A year ago, we started to see the potential in Decentraland. We studied the specifics of Decentraland and spent thousands of hours at work. And now, when we know we can create high-quality content, we turn to DAO, to people who believe in the success of Decentraland as much as we do and who, like us, want to participate in its development. We know it is only the beginning of our great journey in improving the Decentraland.\n\nWe believe that the main thing missing in Decentraland is the reasons for an ordinary user rather than an investor to join Decentraland. The main goal of our game is to become such a reason and thereby attract a large number of new users to Decentraland, which will entail its advancement.\n\nThe game we want to create will be inspired by Dungeons and Dragons but won't be a 100% copy of it. We decided to simplify some mechanics for several reasons:\n\n*   Specifics of computer games.\n*   Limitations of Decentraland.\n*   Rules that are easy to understand. Even if you didn't play games like D\\&D before.\n    Other reasons.\n\nExamples of different game mechanics:\n\n*   A session in D\\&D lasts on average 2-3 hours; in our game, we want to reduce the time of one session to 40-60 minutes.\n\n*   An AI (Artificial Intelligence) will perform the role of the gamemaster (host), so players will have a limited number of action options in a given situation.\n\n*   Players will choose one of the proposed characters rather than creating them themselves.\n\nExpenditure of funds:\n\n*   Purchasing a 2x3 land to place the game on it. To date, the cheapest 2x3 plots are in this price range. People who have made content for Decentraland or have some knowledge about Builder know that acceptable values for triangles, materials, textures, and so on depend on the number of adjacent sections. The 2x3 plot is the minimum size to make beautiful and diverse models of characters, scenery, effects, and other things. (22 000 - 30 000$)\n\n*   Programmer's salary. A programmer is one of the most important specialists in game development. (16 000 - 18 000$)\n\n*   The salary of two 3d artists. Our modelers face a difficult task. They need to meet the scene's limitations but, at the same time, make a lot of diverse, maximally optimized models. (14 000 - 16 000$)\n\n*   Game designer's salary. The game designer will have to think through all the game mechanics and assemble them into a single whole. (8000 - 10 000$)\n\n*   Gamemaster's salary. As I said before, our team is big fans of D\\&D, but we decided to call a professional for the role of the gamemaster. The gamemaster will create 2 intriguing game scenarios with many ramifications and a variety of game passing. They will come up with characters, their personalities, the world and the laws by which they live, and much more. (4000 - 5000$)\n\n*   Artist's salary. The artist will draw hero cards, interfaces, backgrounds, and so on. (3000 - 4000$)\n\n*   Sound designer's salary. Audio is a crucial component of the atmosphere for better immersion. (3000 - 4000$)\n\n*   Other expenses. Various services, servers, etc. (5 000$)\n\n*   Marketing. We will cover this amount using our own funds. We need to make a statement! (10 000 - 12 000$)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nFirst, the gamemaster and the game designer will create the game's foundation. They'll decide which mechanics to replicate from D\\&D, which to change, and which to add. They'll develop 2 adventure scenarios and think through all the dialogues, the variability of actions, characters, etc.\nThen they split into two teams:\n\n1.  The gamemaster will start working with an artist, a sound designer, and one of the 3d artists. This team will be responsible for the lore of the game, its appearance, and its sound.\n2.  The game designer will work with a programmer and a second 3d artist. Their main task will be to make gameplay and smart objects.\n    Even though they'll divide into two other teams, both groups will work closely to ensure that all aspects of the game are compatible.\n\nHow we see the final result (in short):\nEach player (3-5 players in total in one session) is given random characters. Each character has characteristics (strength, charisma, etc.), specific items in the inventory (crossbow, potion, etc.), and other differences. The characters get into some situations and receive a task. For example, players start their journey in a tavern, and they need to find a villager who is a werewolf. The main gameplay will lay in the fact that players will choose options for actions (\"Inspect the tavern,\" \"Approach the tavern and start talking to him\"...). Some actions' success gets determined by a dice roll. For example, in \"Strike a stealthy attack at a robber,\" - you need to roll a dice to test your dexterity. The required number for success is, for example, 10; you roll the dice, if <10 falls out - you missed, >10 - you hit. In total, the player will change up to 5 locations during the game. The game ends when the players have completed the task, failed it, or when all the players' characters have died.\nFor a complete understanding, check out D\\&D if you don't know what kind of game it is.\n\nDue to the variability, the game has great replay value. Play as another character, take other companions to your team, and the game outcome will be completely different. We also plan to release new scripts regularly.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n*   Programmer. More than 6 years in game development. A person who worked on creating websites, mobile applications, and computer games.\n*   3d artists. Specialists in 3D modeling of low-poly objects.\n*   Game designer. Almost 12 years in the profession, the ideological inspirer of the project.\n*   Gamemaster. A professional board game player.\n*   The artist. Art college student.\n*   Sound designer. A person with great listening skills.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n2022 Q3:\n\n*   Prototypes of the main game mechanics (action selection, dice roll, etc.).\n*   Adventure scenarios, lore study.\n*   Concepts of characters, locations, and other things.\n*   Rough 3D models (characters, objects, etc.).\n*   Purchasing a plot for the game.\n*   Alpha version of the game.\n\n2022 Q4:\n\n*   Development of all game mechanics.\n*   All 3D models (scenery, effects, etc.).\n*   Images (player cards, location backgrounds, etc.).\n*   Audio (virtual gamemaster voice acting, sounds of objects, etc.).\n*   Beta version of the game.\n\n2023 Q1:\n\n*   Final adjustments.\n*   Publishing the game.\n*   Marketing (payment to Twitch and YouTube channels, inviting famous bloggers to play our game)\n\nThroughout the work on the project, we will regularly send reports.\nIf you have any questions – ask! We will be happy to answer them :)\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=10535610-0399-11ed-8a2f-a1a061d4350b)**",

    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nCreate a task force to develop and maintain a public registry of individuals and organizations offering their services to build content on Decetraland’s platform. The goal is to provide trusted information to brands coming into the space looking for talented builders who can help with events production, wearables making, 3d modeling, and SDK programming.\n\nThis is a revised version of [a previous grant proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f9561670-fdfb-11ec-8fbf-839e0f96469a).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n49,200 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x256874B9FD26cBf11a4E2DE5CFFE5a877603044d\n\n## Email address\n\nyemel@decentraland.org\n\n## Description\n\nAs the Metaverse concept goes mainstream there are more brands coming into the space willing to build a presence in Decentraland. However, creating 3D content can be a daunting task and most organizations will prefer to hire experienced professionals.\n\nDecentraland creators are one of the most valuable audiences Decentraland has at this point. It’s critical to provide them a platform to promote their services, become more visible, get new clients and grow into a sustainable business.\n\nMaking a public and official registry of Verified Partners will promote transparency between brands and creators. This initiative aims to democratize access to qualified suppliers and generate new business opportunities for them.\n\nThe goal of this project is to survey all creators in Decentraland’s community and list them in a public registry of creators, the Verified Partners Registry. Freelancers and studios alike will be classified based on their info and the services they provide. The registry will be curated by a team, ensuring the authenticity and quality of the information displayed.\n\nThese services are already being offered and requested on other platforms such as [fiverr.com](https://es.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=decentraland) and [freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com/job-search/decentraland/), which is great validation that the market exists. This project aims to support the growth of the industry with a dedicated registry of professionals in this industry, which is free and open to use.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis grant will set up a budget to run this team for the next 6 months. This grant could be extended upon a further decision of the DAO if the grant succeeds its objectives.\n\nThe proposed Verified Parters Registry will be implemented under the same non-profit foundation created for the [DAO Governance Squad](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7). This foundation provides a flexible vehicle to manage a budget with autonomy while still giving authority to the DAO to steer its direction.\n\nThe grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stablecoins assigned to a 2-out-of-3 signatures wallet. The key holders are Alejandro Escoda, Yemel Jardi and maraoz in their respective capacity as Squad Member, DAO Committee Member and Trusted Community Member.\n\nThe public registry will first launch as a dedicated page in Decentraland’s documentation site, a testing version of it is [already available here](https://docs.decentraland.vote/talent-hub/). Once a substantial number of providers are included the team migrate the directory to its own domain for a richer experience (searching, filtering, applying and more).\n\nThe criteria to include a partner in the registry shouldn’t be a matter of taste, but instead a list of verifications about the partner company and the services they claim to provide. Making sure they are correctly classified under different categories/filters. On top of that a layer of reviews from clients could increase transparency and be signal of quality.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nTotal Hours: ~240 monthly hours or ~60 weekly hours.\n\n*   Producer - Agustin Pagano ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agustinpz/))\n*   Producer - Alejandro Escoda ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-escoda-242295245))\n\nBudget: $8,200 USD per month or a total of $49,200 USD\n\n*   Team compensation: $43,200 USD\n*   Operational budget: $6,000 USD\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**August - Bootstrapping the registry**\n\n*   Design interview and verification process.\n*   Define a strategy to source potential partners and set up inbound request flow.\n*   Initiate interview process for partners providing Wearable Creation, Architecture, and SDK Development.\n\n**September - Iteration of the process**\n\n*   Review the results, evaluate improvements and automation opportunities.\n*   Initiate interview process for partners providing Event Production and Full Cycle Production.\n\n**October - Complete the registry**\n\n*   Explore the addition of new service categories (e.g. animation, audio, land rental).\n*   Produce a report of “Metaverse Workers”, a summary of the collected info.\n\n**November - Migrate to its own site**\n\n*   Define requirements to migrate the registry enabling a richer user experience.\n*   Prototype the new version of the registry.\n\n**December - Launch new registry**\n\n*   Set up in production the new version of the registry.\n*   Announcement and support for new onboarding flows.\n\n**January - Maintenance**\n\n*   Documentation of the process to maintain the registry functional.\n*   New release of the Metaverse Workers report.\n\nBy the end of this project, this team will have a complete mapping of the industry’s experts and a trusted tool to browse them. This project should be a platform for new creators jumping into the industry and a key resource for organizations looking for a partner to build content inside Decentraland.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=81af5b00-02e6-11ed-8f44-ef1722f0509f)**",

    "body": "> by 0x31e0a65b27553d6ade0b37191cee29ebbb63fbdb (GrizzledGatsby)\n\nDCL as a platform does not have a blanket music license, and its terms and conditions hold land owners responsible for any activity on their land. This means ALL of us need our own terms and conditions built into our properties and any and all appropriate licenses to communicate music.\n\nWe have been having discussions with SOCAN (the music licensing body in Canada), about the best way to approach protecting artists in the web3 space and the most appropriate way to move forward with licensing. Ultimately, SOCAN is a not-for-profit that exists to ensure artists get royalties from license fees whenever and wherever their work is communicated.\n\nTo be clear, SOCAN is not on a witch hunt, but these issues WILL be resolved with or without us. Now is the time for us to have an impact on what music licensing looks like in the web3 space. Together with these licensing bodies, we believe that we can build a bright future where everyone is protected and creators receive proper compensation for the communication of their works, whether at events in the meta, distribution of music via NFT, etc.\n\nWhether we like it or not, the reality is that licensing needs to be addressed. We propose doing a Twitter Spaces AMA with SOCAN on July 28th to educate the community on current regulations and start the discussion about the best way to license this new space.\nWe are of the opinion that DAO funds should be used to blanket license anyone who purchases land to allow for more creative freedom to communicate music. We may decide as a community that the best way to proceed is to keep things decentralized, but then, as previously stated, the onus will be on us as landowners to ensure we are compliant.\n\nOPTIONS:\n\n1.  DAO pays retroactive licensing fees for all users and agrees to work with licensing bodies to pay for an annual blanket license moving forward. (I will help facilitate these conversations, and SOCAN can help to connect DCL Foundation with sister licensing bodies to move towards international compliance)\n\nor\n\n2.  Leave the responsibility to land owners to obtain their own licenses. This means land owners will need licenses for every jurisdiction where their end users reside.\n\n- DAO pays retroactive music licensing fees and for blanket license annually \n- Leave the responsibility to land owners to obtain their own licenses\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fa911b60-02c5-11ed-8f44-ef1722f0509f)**",

    "title": "Make Decentraland Buildings/3D assets NFTs that can be added to the builder.",
    "body": "> by 0xc70650c50487853ed6ff692945cd05a446a95536 (RenoviTeam)\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nRenovi is a niche NFT marketplace and content creation studio for architecture/3D design.\n\nOur goal is to allow DCL-compatible NFT assets that are on marketplaces to be available on the DCL builder.\n\nThis will allow creators to monetise their works, even if they do not own land while users can purchase/utilise the assets on their respective parcels.\n\nSimilar to how wearables grew in popularity as seen during fashion week, we believe that the next step would be for buildings/furniture.\n\nThis was validated by an ever-growing community of builders who participated in the https://topmetaversebuild.com which was hosted in DCL, One Time Square of which the foundation donated a land parcel as part of the prizes (https://bit.ly/3OZjKRv).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x5CD3581B0865a883C5D2940bE1C85272F226acFA\n\n## Email address\n\nadonis@renovi.io\n\n## Description\n\nThe ultimate question Renovi is trying to answer is “Who is building the Metaverse?”\n\n\"Metaverse does not come from any industry giant, but the crystallisation of millions of people's co-creation,\" says Epic CEO Tim Sweeney. This is what DCL set out to do, co-create the Metaverse, but believe there can be more contributors to the Metaverse puzzle.\n\nOur guiding compass is to encourage architecture in the Metaverse and to develop a new economic model for architects/3D designers in the process of architecting the Metaverse. With an active influx of high-quality buildings to DCL there will be more experiences for users rather than vast areas of barren land. We are also confident that monthly user adoption and user-generated events will also rise. For such a task to occur we need to revolutionise the way the marketplace, builder and SDK currently operate.\n\nRenovi believes that to build further, more complex and enticing experiences within DCL the correct stakeholders need to be rewarded for creating. This implies that high-quality, professional architects/3D designers but also upcoming talent needs to be interested and more importantly motivated to create for the Metaverse.\n\nArchitects/3D Designers can now break their real-life moulds and find new monetary avenues by leveraging their efforts for exponential development through DCL.\n\nFollowing on from our successful poll “Decentraland scenes as NFTs: Should scenes also be NFTs that can be sold within the Decentraland marketplace?” (Link: https://bit.ly/3P1dybU) we have taken onboard the feedback from the various stakeholders and revised our approach to offer a better solution.\n\nWe aim to create cross-platform compatible 3D asset NFTs from Renovi Marketplace to DCL. We want to create a seamless experience in which a creator can upload a 3D asset in Renovi Marketplace (or any other marketplace) and put it for sale. Consequently the buyer of that 3D asset now an NFT will be able to navigate directly from the marketplace to the DCL builder in which they can find the asset as a new asset pack. Within a few clicks, they should be able to place the asset on their land and if further alterations are required they can download the scene so it can be altered on the SDK.\n\nTo achieve this we will integrate the Renovi marketplace to DCL by building part of the DCL API links so that 3D assets are compatible and can be presented in the builder as long as they belong to the respective user’s wallet. This will enable us to automate the current procedure. Currently, the buyer of a 3D asset needs to download it and reupload it to the builder while at the same time there is no clear way of ensuring they are the owners of that building as an NFT. We will offer a single, simple streamlined solution for DCL.\n\nAs part of giving back to the community, we will also need to ensure that there is API compatibility between DCL products and Renovi Marketplace or any other marketplace. We want to make it possible that everyone who purchases a 3D asset as an NFT that is compatible with DCL can connect their wallet, navigate to the builder of DCL and be able to find the respective 3D asset as an external asset pack that can be placed on their land.\n\nOur goal is to automate the implementation pipeline, and indirectly add buildings as NFTs into DCL by opening up the builder and its capabilities to a wider audience.\n\nWebsite: https://renovi.io\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/eMEPwxCyEk\n\nTwitter: https://bit.ly/3P3MNn2\n\n\n## Specification\n\nHow can we achieve this?\n\nTo achieve a technical specification of this magnitude, we will need to carefully craft and technically architect each stage of our infrastructure and execution. This will entail developing an API, which we will label as the “industry standard” prototype for interoperable communication. Developing a standard will be subject to outlining in full, all parameters that are currently present within DCL technical ecosystem. E.g. project name, parcel type, parcel dimensions, file type, price, chain, triangles, materials, meshes, bodies, entities and textures etc.\n\nThis will be followed by documentation, enabling a user to educate themselves on creating GET/POST requests to and from the Renovi and DCL ecosystems. All API calls will be open and provided to the public to interact with. We will allow users to obtain authentication mechanisms in the form of bearer tokens, from us, which can be invoked/revoked at any time, to facilitate the usage of our API. Upon integration and authentication, with industry standards, the user will be able to interact with the API to either fetch, embed, post, and/or utilise all the parameters available for each Metaverse asset.\n\nAt MVP stages, these interactions will bypass through a bespoke Content Management System (CMS) built on NodeJS and/or equivalent, as this enables us to interact with the blockchain using web3 infrastructure. Once an API request is authenticated and a user has posted their metaverse asset for approval, their user ID, wallet ID and asset ID will be manually (at first) approved and sent to the DCL builder. The CMS will enable any admin to utilise the CRUD convention (Create, Read, Edit, Delete) along with import/exporting any assets needed, to open communication lines between the CMS and the DCL builder. This could function in a similar way to approving DCL wearables.\n\nSome of our previous work creating for DCL\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/13Zxq0vEFG0wY_wn9ivqAcsexGbKrhzcK/view?usp=sharing\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5WstmHEmTw4wGQQir92j52v-qVwiVc1/view?usp=sharing\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1QPiPG53ucwWgdLyakvIwBRVxTDGgq7Q3/view?usp=sharing\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10XSz4\\_MWEJDuOhNyhkFdVLvtqXaZArUg/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nJacob Papageorgiou - CTO/ Co-Founder of Renovi together with a team of 6 talented full-stack web, DevOps, blockchain engineers and 2 UIUX Designers under his management will be able to execute these goals promptly.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-papa/\n\nhttps://github.com/mostmojo\n\nIn the last decade, Jacob has led teams in the U.S and U.K and has worked alongside developers of the likes of TransferWise & Revolut.\n\nHe's been a Technical Advisor to Blockchain and Private Equity startups and has led tech teams with clients of the likes of Nike, Vodafone, Adidas, National Lottery, Gordon Ramsay and UCL.\n\nHe has been a fellow educator for Brixton-based code camps and global leading tech boot camp Le Wagon, before founding Mojo Digital of which he has a client base of over 300 web applications/sites to date before co-founding Renovi.\n\nAdditionally, he’s been on the board of Coin Mara, an African Startup as a Technical Architect, that raised over $30M from Coinbase Ventures, Huobi and more.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nCreate a cross-platform connection for 3D assets that are NFTs from Renovi Marketplace to DCL.\n\nRebuild part of Decentraland’s existing builder so that 3D Assets that are NFTs can flow directly from marketplaces to the DCL builder.\n\n40K 4 months\n\nBuild an API layer of communication enabling the user to transfer NFTs from a marketplace to a DCL builder.\n\n34K 3 months\n\nEnsure API compatibility between DCL products, Renovi Marketplace but also other marketplaces such as Opensea. This in the future can allow Decentraland products to act as a dynamic RSS feed, enabling any NFTs bought and validated with the category “Buildings” (for example) to be showcased within DCL’s builder.\n\n26K 2 months\n\nA user that uploads a GLTF file for example on Renovi Marketplace can currently input “Compatible on Decentraland”, this would set a boolean value to True, and ping a GET request to the Decentraland API. Upon request, a dashboard can be created for both Decentraland and RNVI admins, to approve and therefore port over any assets from RENOVI to Decentraland with the click of one button (after setting the boolean values to TRUE).\n\n20K 3 months\n\nImplement security measures for API endpoints and documentation, so both parties can access a JSON-like structure for the NFTs and open communication lines for API calls\n\nTotal estimated cost: $120K\nTotal estimated delivery time: 12 months\n\nWe believe that our project complies with the Decentraland Content Policy, Terms of Use, and Code of Ethics.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=99afcf60-0218-11ed-8f44-ef1722f0509f)**",

Compatibility with digital fashion is the holy grail of this task. NFT technology promises interoperability, but all games/metaverses/apps have different avatars, graphic styles, and poly-counts for assets. There is no standard. So we also have multiple 3D files for each digital outfit. In order to support “interoperability” companies drop separate NFTs compatible with different metaverses. They are not linked. It is just creating a new copy of the design. None of them are compatible. They are not very useful for use outside of the platform on which they were created, and duplicating designs for portability to different worlds blurs the ownership, value and uniqueness of assets.\n\nSolution:\nWe’ve built an infrastructure that allows a single EVM-compatible asset to be worn not only in the game marketplace it was bought in, but in all worlds, everywhere it goes it converts to the appearance of the platform it’s in. We tap into the backend of metaverse marketplaces to make these assets tradable in-game. On the contrary of our competitors, who drop separate NFTs compatible for the different virtual worlds, our infrastructure does not create a duplicate of NFTs. Each 1 NFT works as an access pass to the compatible version of 3D asset for multiple metaverses/games/VR/AR/Zoom filters etc.\n\nDecentraland have been the first who started to support linked wearable, but our project serves to extend this capability to many other worlds and provide single window for the users/brands/metaverses.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe have described our tech in the following article: https://medium.com/gravity-the-studio\n\nOur demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNAj7YMWpSo\\&t=1s\nOur website:  https://gravitylayer.io\nGithub: https://github.com/Gravity-Studio-Digital-Wear\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gravitylayer/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GravitySkins\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Ejh4jEPRDC\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/gravitylayer/\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nOur team for now consist of 10 full time team members and 2 ongoing freelancers.\nOur CEO and co-founder background is in ad agencies, her master’s research was in 3D fashion and digital identity.

An example: 2 customizations (one for party outfits and one for Wonderzone).\n\nThis would free the user a lot from choosing clothes for the bonuses, or searching through so many wearables.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nIt is extremely necessary, since searching through all the wearables is somewhat uncomfortable.\n\nIt would make the game much easier.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe reason for this proposal is to streamline the gameplay of users.\n\nI come to propose 2 points that I consider essential:\n\nAllow to sort wearables in the overview by received date and by rarity, be able to customize.\n\nAllow customization of the avatar, so that a set of clothes is saved.

It is currently on a 7x7 estate located at coordinates 126, 44. Our goal is to create a fun and vibrant gaming community with a player-driven economy; by which, individuals can own items in the form of blockchain assets that they can buy/sell/trade as they please. Our experienced team of programmers, designers, and support personnel bring years of talent to enable us to meet this goal.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x5117571b0BEc00372CE00870ad8E523C704a78b7\n\n## Email address\n\njoshuajtv1@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nDecentraland (DCL) allows for an immense amount of personal creativity and freedom.  DCL creates the opportunity to engage with others in novel ways in an expansive virtual space; be that by attending concerts and galleries, or playing games.  We seek to expand on the gaming options within DCL by building Exodus: Goodbye World!\n\nWe feel that having a large-scale, frequently updated game within the DCL platform will provide years of entertainment and financial value to the community.  It will help drive increased user traffic into DCL and to the overall DCL gaming scene.\nExodus aims to be massive, immersive, and create an engaging player experience.  Initially set in a medieval era, players will be able to train their skills, gather a variety of resources, craft tools & equipment, and even earn NFTs through gameplay.  As we approach and overcome the challenges of hosting a huge variety of items on-chain, we will eventually bridge in-game resources to public blockchain(s).  This will help create a player driven Play-and-Earn economy where players can truly own the results of their hard in-game work.\nIn developing Exodus, we have a heavy focus on educational outreach.  We are providing opportunities for interns and community members who want to be part of our journey. Whether the focus is design or software development, our team environment is supportive of those who want to learn and contribute to the project.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nExodus has already started its Closed Beta. Throughout the beta we will be creating and adding portions of the game on a regular schedule. Before launching the beta we worked passionately on the front-end and back-end infrastructure to ensure the basic gaming mechanics were enabled. This included the Inventory interface, Banking functionality, Daily challenges, Leveling system, Beta Currency, and first gaming objective - Woodchopping.  We also created the scenery and over 100 assets for use in the game.\n\nThe Closed Beta of Exodus went live on June 20th, 2022 at coordinates 126,44.  In the three weeks since, we have created and enabled an in-game Merchandise interface, rolled out Scavenger Hunting, and nearly completed preparations for the next gaming objective - Fishing.  Future releases will involve other skills and activities, including Workshopping, Mining, Forging, Cooking, and Hunting.  During beta, we will be writing an in-depth storyline so that Questing activities can be included post-beta.\n\nWe plan to continue to release major updates on a monthly basis, as permitted, until the full game completion by the end of the closed Beta.  We aim to deliver minor bug fixes, quality of life updates, and patches on a weekly to biweekly basis.\nPlease view our video that walks you through the beginning stages of our game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6trfYpRivP0\nAfter the closed Beta period, Exodus will have an OPEN Beta to further stress test the game’s infrastructure and prepare for public release.\n\nWe use a variety of technologies for software development, design, server maintenance, and project organization.  This includes, but is not limited to: AWS, Discord, Github, Blender, the Adobe Suite, and Visual Studio.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nOur team consists of 16 team members and continues to grow. We are a group of video game enthusiasts who have a complimentary variety of skill and experience.  This includes experience in blockchain applications, back-end infrastructure, the DCL SDK, graphic design, and 3D design & animation.  We have regular team meetings and constantly collaborate in order to bring the project to life.\n\nOur team includes:\nLeadership\n\n*   Myself: Owner, Influencer, Streamer\n    Engineering\n*   1 Lead Architect ( 8 years full-stack development experience )\n    – 1 Senior Back-End Engineer\n*   2 College Interns split between Front-End and Back-End\n    Art & Design\n*   1 Lead Scene Designer ( 10 years in 3D game design, secondary focus on front-end development )\n*   1  Animator & UI Designer\n*   4 Asset Artists ( Both 2D and 3D assets )\n    Support\n*   1 Web Designer\n*   1 Head of Marketing\n*   1 Story Writer\n*   1 Video Editor\n*   1 Product Advisor\n\nWe continue to provide opportunities for interns and other community members who want to be part of our journey, and would like to be able to utilize this grant to expand these efforts.  Whether the focus is design or software development, our team environment is supportive of those who want to learn and contribute to the project.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nFunding will be divided into Engineering (paying developers and interns, and recruiting more interns), Design (paying artists), Marketing (designing promotional videos & running ads), and miscellaneous expenses like music (we plan to create custom themed music), story writing, and server upkeep. These values are approximate and subject to change depending on need. The funding will be divided approximately into the following amounts:\nEngineering - $125,000\nDesign – $75,000\nMarketing - $25,000\nMiscellaneous - $15,000\n\nRoadmap and milestones\nCurrent milestones & achievements:\nWoodchopping (released June 20th)\nMerch Store (released June 27th)\nScavenger Hunting (July 9th)\n\nCurrent roadmap:\nFishing (end of July)\n\nWorkshopping (end of August)\n\nMining (end of September)\n\nForging (end of October)\n\nCooking (end of November)\n\nHunting (end of December)\n\nPlease note, this is subject to delay, advancement, and change.\n\nThe Exodus team will have a monthly report posted on \"Project Updates\" upon grant approval.\n\nAs well, we have consistent updates, progress, bug fixes, etc... across these socials.\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/j_t_v\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JTV\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ExodusGBW\n\nhttps://discord.com/invite/jtv\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=38896e40-0122-11ed-8f44-ef1722f0509f)**",

    "body": "> by 0x87956abc4078a0cc3b89b419928b857b8af826ed (Nacho)\n\nBug bounty programs are open invitations to security researchers to discover and disclose potential vulnerabilities in projects’ smart contracts and applications, thereby protecting projects and their users. For their good work, security researchers receive a reward based on the severity of the vulnerability, as determined by the project affected.\n\nWhy have a bug bounty program at all? In 2020 alone, hacks and scams cost the Web3 community over $238m, and bug bounties can prevent those hacks from happening. Bug bounty programs surface vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before they get exploited in malicious hacks that destroy projects and ruin reputations.\n\nAs member of the Security Advisory Board (SAB), we hereby request the DAO to approve and fund the bounty program and due to its nature and limited execution capabilities, delegate to the Decentraland Foundation the ability to respond to any vulnerability disclosed through the program. That means that the Decentraland Foundation is committed to do the triage and answer the disclosures received, while the DAO is in charge of providing the funds needed once a confirmed bug report is reviewed and confirmed. So basically when a payment has to happen due to a valid report under the program, the Decentralan Foundation will inform DAO with case #, the recipient wallet address and amount to be paid and also, shall contact  the SAB in order to fix the vulnerabilities disclosed.\n\nThe program is composed of different threat levels and topics:\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nHigh\t\t\t\t\t**Up to USD 500 000**\n\nMedium\t\t\t                **Up to USD 20 000**\n\nLow\t\t\t\t\t        **USD 1 000**\n\n**Websites and Applications**\n\nCritical\t\t\t\t        **USD 18 000**\n\nHigh\t\t\t\t       **USD 6 000**\n\nMedium\t\t\t\t       **USD 3 000**\n\nLow\t\t\t\t\t       **USD 1 000**\n\nPayouts are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in **MANA and USDT**, with a minimum of 20% to be done in USDT.\n\nThe program is not tied or attached to any third party but the Decentraland Foundation will use them and their expertise and platforms to help administrate the program. Therefore and after a deep initial analysis, the SAB has selected and recommend the Decentraland Foundation to start the bounty program using [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/).\n\nThe Decentraland bounty program can be found [here](https://immunefi.com/bounty/decentraland/).\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c8c8ee20-fee5-11ec-8f44-ef1722f0509f)**",

The goal is to connect brands coming into the space with talented builders who can help with events production, wearables making, 3D modeling and SDK programming.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n118,200 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x444327160dC3e72F3146b7F95e7D77Ca9aBF6172\n\n## Email address\n\nyemel@decentraland.org\n\n## Description\n\nAs the Metaverse concept goes mainstream there are more and more brands coming into the space willing to build a presence in Decentraland. However, creating 3D content can be a daunting task and most organizations will prefer to hire experienced professionals.\n\nDecentraland creators are one of the most valuable audiences Decentraland has at this point. It is crucial to have a dedicated team to support them and promote their services, effectively helping them to grow into a sustainable business.\n\nCreating a public and official registry of Verified Partners will promote transparency between brands and creators. With this initiative, we aim to democratize access to qualified suppliers and generate new sources of business opportunities for them.\n\nThe first goal of this team is to survey all creators in the Decentraland community and list them in a public registry of creators, the Verified Partners Registry. The team will also provide support and foster networking opportunities between the partners community.\n\nA second goal of the team is to do an outreach to brands willing to invest in their online presence. The team will create a strategy to market the services provided by the verified partners, onboarding brands, and position Decentraland as a great place to build.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis grant will set up a budget to run this team for the next 6 months. This grant could be extended upon a further decision of the DAO if the grant succeeds in its objectives.\n\nThe proposed Partner Support Squad will be implemented under the same non-profit foundation created for the  [DAO Governance Squad](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7). This foundation provides a flexible vehicle to manage a budget with autonomy while still giving authority to the DAO to steer its direction.\n\nThe grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stablecoins assigned to a 2-out-of-3 signatures wallet. The key holders are Bianca Monti, Yemel Jardi and maraoz in their respective capacities as Squad Lead, DAO Committee Member and Trusted Community Member.\n\nThe public registry will first launch as a dedicated page on Decentraland’s documentation site, a testing version of it is  [already available here](https://docs.decentraland.vote/talent-hub/). Once a substantial number of providers are included and the services they provide are surveyed, the team will plan the migration of the directory to its own domain for a richer experience (searching, filtering, applying, and more).\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe team is made up of two departments and a project manager to coordinate their efforts:\n\n*   Business Development: Two experienced producers will dedicate 60hrs per week to verify partners and create business opportunities for them.\n\n*   Marketing: Two experienced marketers who will be working 20 hrs per week on designing and implementing communication strategies to onboard new partners and brands. They will manage a monthly budget to produce content and advertise it.\n\nTeam members:\n\n*   Project Manager - Bianca Monti ( [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bianca-monti-06944784/) )\n*   Producer - Agustin Pagano - ( [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agustinpz/) )\n*   Producer - Alejandro Escoda ( [Resume](https://gist.github.com/yemel/60ec70a2c0094eb3beaff7073a18e0f0) )\n*   Marketer - Matias Basile ( [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matias-basile-918870173/) )\n*   Marketer - Ramiro Valverde ( [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramiro-valverde-00a65854/) )\n\nTotal Hours: ~440 monthly hours or ~110 weekly hours.\nBudget: $19,700 USD per month or a total of $118,200 USD\n\nThis includes:\n\n*   Team compensation: $97,200 USD\n*   Marketing Budget: $18,000 USD\n*   Operational expenses: $3,000\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nDuring the 6 months of this project the team will focus on:\n\n*   Bootstrap the **Verified Partners Registry.**\n    1.  Contact all Decentraland creators and survey the services they provide.\n    2.  Develop a process/criteria to verify the partners and previous experience.\n    3.  Review applications from potential partners to join the registry.\n    4.  Evaluate results and propose a definition for the next version of the registry.\n\n*   Market the **Verified Partners Registry** to several audiences.\n    1.  Reach out to all studios and freelancers already providing services for other metaverses in the industry.\n    2.  Educate brands about the possibility of building a presence in the metaverse.\n    3.  Create business opportunities by connecting brands with relevant verified partners.\n\n*   Support the partners' community & foster networking opportunities\n    1.  Discover the needs and opportunities to empower/boost the partners' community.\n    2.  Host regular online meetings between the partners' community to share knowledge and present relevant initiatives.\n    3.  Collaborate with the DCL Foundation Marketing team to amplify partners' announcements and achievements.\n    4.  Collaborate with DCL Foundation Engineering teams to provide technical support to verified partners and summarize feedback about DCL tools usage.\n\nFinally, the team will plan the next iteration of the registry, which might include the migration to its own site and the inclusion of the DAO in the process of adding/removing members of the registry.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f9561670-fdfb-11ec-8fbf-839e0f96469a)**",

    "title": "Should Decentraland have a mature content wearables filter?",
    "body": "> by 0x6a77883ed4e65a1df591fda2f5252fd7c548f198 (Fancy)\n\nSUMMARY\n\nCreate an OPTIONAL (opt in/out) mature content filter for wearables that may be deemed inappropriate or unprofessional.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAs the wearables creator community has grown, a wide variety of items have been published that may upset individuals or groups.  This poll is being presented to the community to determine if there is a want or need to filter (hide) some of the wearable designs which may cause cause discomfort to members of our growing community.\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nDecentraland is a globally accessible platform that invites users from all communities to be able to interact, build, and contribute to the social and economic aspects of the platform.  Everyone should feel welcome and safe in our virtual world.  Currently the decisions as to whether an item should be allowed or not allowed fall on the wearable curation team.  This proposal aims to put the decision making in the hands of each individual user.  Anyone could choose to allow all mature content to be shown, allow for some mature content, or select specific items they do not want to see.\n\nSPECIFICATION\n\nProposed classes of items which might be considered mature would include sexually provocative items which 'show too much skin', weapons, and wearables which have blood.  This proposal aims to put the decision making in the hands of each individual user.  My goal in suggesting the creation of such a filter is NOT to censor anyone.  I feel it would actually allow for even more mature content to be created.\n\nIMPACTS\n\nAnyone could choose to allow all mature content to be shown, allow for some mature content, or select specific items they do not want to see.  By giving each user the ability to curate their own experience, the need to curate this aspect of wearables will be removed and the team to focus on more important issues.  Implementation of this proposal could allow for more provocative wearable designs, more realistic weapon designs, and the approval of wearables which were not allowed due to violation of guidelines which the wearables curation team have to oblige by.\n\nIt would also allow for a more welcoming environment for users and communities who might use Decentraland if they had the ability to filter out mature content they don't deem appropriate.  Schools, business professionals, and other more conservative groups are among those who might benefit from the filters.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION PATHWAYS\n\nA default grouping system for each type of mature content themed wearable comes to mind.  Each group could be toggled on and off at the users discretion.  I'm suggesting one group for weapons, one group for sexually suggestive wearables, one group for wearables containing blood ect.  This filter would need to be developed by the foundation or an external dev team for these default options.\n\nThe addition of an allow list and a block list which could be accessible in a user interface panel would also be greatly beneficial, so that specific wearables of a users choosing could be shown or hidden.  By adding the contact address(es) of any wearable to the allow/block lists, literally any item could be hidden from view if a user chooses.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nEveryone should feel safe and comfortable in DCL.  This proposed solution would give the power of choice to each individual user, and allow content creators to express themselves in a fully decentralized way.  If this poll meets the threshold for approval, I will work on developing a more in depth proposal.  I understand there will be a cost associated with the development, and will recruit the assistance of qualified advisors to determine what an actual cost would be.  My plan is to work with DAO committee members, code developers, and the community to make this proposal as solid and executable as possible.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=00b4d480-fd73-11ec-8fbf-839e0f96469a)**",

    "title": "POI Management Optimizations: Unify POI lists and improve the operational aspect",
    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[[Resubmission] Should the legacy POI list be deleted?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=78635ac0-c4d8-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4)\n\n## Summary\n\nUpdate the current POI management mechanism by removing the centralized list and unifying it with the decentralized DAO-maintained list, migrate that list to Polygon (cost reduction) and outside of Aragon (Better UX)\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to solve the existing complexity created by having two POI lists, [one centralized under the Decentraland Foundation](https://config.decentraland.org/explorer.json) and the other maintained by the DAO using an Aragon smart contract. The proposed solution encompasses: Deleting the Legacy POI list, and moving the DAO-maintained POI list from the Ethereum mainnet to Polygon and outside of the Aragon infrastructure in order to reduce the costs and enhance the experience of adding and removing POIs. Finally, the DAO core teams will encourage the community to create proposals under the Add POI category in the Decentraland DAO Governance dApp to add the POIs that are still considered relevant.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs the project keeps moving towards an even more decentralized future, having a list that cannot be modified by the community or having two lists that community developers need to take into consideration when building products for the Decentraland ecosystem is a weak spot. Especially if that list contains such essential places in the Decentraland world as Genesis Plaza, the Decentraland Museum, or the Crypto Valley.\n\nAlso, moving the DAO-maintained list away from the Ethereum mainnet and Aragon infrastructure into Polygon will reduce operational costs (Currently adding/removing POIs cost ~200USD in gas fees) and make the process for the DAO Committee easier, as using Aragon to send transactions is not ideal UX-wise.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nBelow is a proposed list of milestones:\n\n\\-Launch a communication campaign regarding this change and encourage Decentraland users to submit POI addition proposals for the POIs present on the Legacy POI list they still consider relevant (~30 days)\n\n\\-Once that period ends, the DAO Committee will engage with the Decentralad Foundation teams to orchestrate how the change will be done. This will be communicated to the Decentraland community via Discord and the Forum.\n\n\\-The actions to be orchestrated will be: Delete the Legacy POI list, enact the addition of the new POIs on the DAO-maintained list by the DAO Committee (Ideally those two actions should happen synchronously), and migrate the DAO-maintained list to Polygon.\n\n\\-Communicate to the community the result of these actions.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy doing this we keep empowering Decentraland users to make decisions about the project via proper DAO Governance mechanisms while simplifying the operations and reducing the costs of adding and removing POIs. As the Decentraland community and the activity grows, being cost-effective and quick regarding these changes will lead to a better experience for the users. Also, taking out the embedded Legacy -POI list from the World Explorer (a.k.a. Reference Client) removes the control of a centralized entity and gives everyone the same access to leveraging the POI list on their own implementations.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d43ed210-fd5f-11ec-8fbf-839e0f96469a)**",

    "body": "> by 0x4a68a46859329a14acf56b66ee45721795769e2b (s#9e2b)\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAbstract\nIn 2021, the word “Metaverse” went viral. However, there are only a few people who actually have experienced “Metaverse” in Japan. So Us, Room Zero is going to build Decentraland’s first interactive “Metaverse” class where visitors get to enhance their understanding towards Crypto and Metaverse (Defi, NFTs, and etc).  This will help users to understand why Metaverse can be the next future where people get to interact in a more secure and transparent society.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n98,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4A68a46859329a14AcF56B66EE45721795769E2b\n\n## Description\n\nRoom Zero was founded in 2017 to deepen our understanding towards the next wave, web3. Our team has been working on developing a variety of platforms such as “Cheese” which is a platform where users receive a bitcoin in exchange for leaving a review for public products. This platform already has almost 100,000 active users just in Japan and is planning to spread even more.\n\nThe reason why we started our development in web 3 is because we clearly felt the need for transparency that is lacking in today’s society. Additionally, the enthusiasm which this web3 community has is insane! So we decided to come up with a plan to we can spread the knowledge of web 3 technologies on decentraland even to people who do not know what “blockchain” is.\n\nThis will help new entering-users to comprehend the potentials which Metaverse has, which will revitalize our community and tokens faster and bigger. Since we concluded that the people are not as excited as the peak time is because the structure of Metaverse (even just in crypto) is too complicated that people didn’t really understand the value and potentials of Metaverse. Thus we believe that this will help our new users to comprehend what Metaverse is.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nSpecification\nTo make the users more involved in our platform, the layout and the design of its building has to look fun and attractive. We’re not going to build a library where users get to just walk around and read textbooks. That’s just too boring. But rather, we’re going to build a dreamland where visitors get to experience and learn about web 3. For instance, we’re under development of building a maze where people have to choose the right answer for them to make it to the goal.\nAlso, we’re planning to build an escape room and roller coaster where users can experience and learn about structures of P2E and DAO.\n\nList of things where this land will provide\n・Learning about the structure of Metaverse\n・Structure of Crypto/Blockchain and its potential\n・What is NFT?\n・Defi\n・Metaverse new idea box\n\nAlso, using DAO, we’re planning to distribute tokens where investors get to govern the service of its development.\n\nThe allocation of investment will be\n・$3,000 : For hiring an Architect Designer\n・$2,000：DAO Development\n・$4,800 : Land Creator\n\\*We also have several creators in our team (not included in a grant).\n\nImage:file:///C:/Users/info/Downloads/dao.PNG\n\\*This is our test-play screen of the maze.. We cannot show you what the actual buildings will look like yet since it’s under development.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nWe already have multiple investors and a VC who is willing to invest for us to make a land purchase. Our budget for the land is approximately $200K so far, so we’re going to have fairly big lands where users can interact and learn about the structure of Crypto and Metaverse.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n・Final design decided (August)\n・Creating lands (September-January)\n・In Public (Feburary) →Improvements\n\nThis is our first grant report so feel free to leave any feedback or comments.\nEnglish is not our first language so I apologize if there’s any part where our description is unclear. But we know this plan is going to help not only Decentraland community but also web3 industry as a whole, so please help us receive our grant!\nThank you.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1dc97780-fc18-11ec-a32a-859962cd3c29)**",

    "body": "> by 0x48c0e3fc56ccc81444bcdda71bae39416007ea30 (MetaMundo)\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe aim is to build a fully functional integration between the [MetaMundo](https://metamundo.co/) marketplace and Decentraland to enable new and existing 3D creators to drive user adoption and engagement in Decentraland by populating it more efficiently with 3D assets. This will benefit 3D creators, landowners and Decentraland users altogether.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n115,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x48C0E3fC56ccc81444bCDDA71bae39416007Ea30\n\n## Description\n\nThere is a huge opportunity to improve monthly active users with an active inflow of high quality scenes. Making sure there is more to do and to see, is possible by helping 3D creators get their scenes into Decentraland with less friction, enabling more building. If Decentraland is able to attract more new users by more easily deploying new experiences, it will strengthen it’s position as one of the leading platforms in the metaverse.\n\nMetaMundo recently launched as a dedicated 3D NFT marketplace for metaverse scenes and assets. Our aim is to onboard our existing network of 16,000 plus high quality and experienced 3D modelers, architects and designers to help build experiences, scenes and assets for the metaverse. This network comes from the team and their previous companies. MetaMundo's vision is to remove the major inefficiencies for creating metaverse scenes and assets and ​​make it very easy for creators to publish engaging content ready to use in Decentraland through their 3D model conversion and optimisation pipelines delivered to the DCL end user with just a few clicks.\n\nOur intention is to build a seamless integration between the MetaMundo marketplace and the Decentraland SDK so that 3D scene and asset collectors can be easily deployed to their land without friction. The integration will bring a high quality 3D NFT marketplace on board as a partner organization to easily supply scenes to Decentraland and drive traffic, engagement and retention. Our mission with this is to help to populate Decentraland with engaging content at a much faster rate and enable artists to list and sell their creations on a much larger scale. The MetaMundo platform integration will also function as an active onramp for new 3D artists into Decentraland.\n\nReference links:\n\n[Website](https://metamundo.co/)\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/metamundo)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/metamundo_NFT)\n\n[Medium](https://metamundo.medium.com/)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo develop a seamless deployment solution, it’s important to describe and breakdown how MetaMundo supports 3D creators to optimize and mint their models into 3D NFTs optimized for Decentraland. The first two parts of the process are focused on model processing and configuration. With the artwork and the interactions configured, the final part of the process is to integrate assets into Decentraland via the Builder. We’re planning to deliver a seamless experience by passing all the configurations and artwork defined prior to import directly into a user’s Scene, ready to deploy to their LAND.\n\nWe will start with integrating the MetaMundo marketplace with DCL via API to work directly with the Builder and DCL SDK. This will enable us to automate all the steps that are currently required from the user, like importing and configuration, and turn this into a single, more streamlined flow directly from the MetaMundo marketplace.\n\nOur servers we will store a safe backup of all the files acquired by the user. These servers will help us configure the files in the cloud enabling easier deployment of the data defined from the MetaMundo platform. Data will be sent between the server, the client and marketplace using traditional data requisition and JSON data transfer for complex data, and sensitive content will be secured under wallet validation using Web3 standards.\n\nWe plan to develop a library of interactions and ready-to-use features and plug-ins, built entirely in Typescript/Javascript to make it easier to interact with the DCL SDK. This way we can abstract part of the development work, and this layer will ensure we automate manual processes like positioning and configuring sub systems from the NFT. We’ll create a complete building system using cloud infrastructure with CI to ensure we can automatically test, run and iterate with assets under development.\n\nOur goal is to automate the model processing pipeline. It will go from high-fidelity 3D file to a DCL optimized version, we will create plugins for leading 3D software (Python scripts will be adapted for each software) that will have a faster iteration process, along with a complete CI system helping artists to validate their 3D work in the Decentraland environment without any friction (enabling a preview build easily from Blender and 3ds Max).\n\nHere are a few examples of interactive scenes by popular artists like Dutchtide, LuisFern5 and Mila Lolli that MetaMundo has helped optimize for use in Decentraland:\n\n![ZenGarden by Dutchtide!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view\\&id=1-ukbQAoh7USitMFCzs8C13fUd6PW9PhY \"ZenGarden by Dutchtide\")\n\n![metaESTATES_VILLA by LuisFern5!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view\\&id=1-lX7UaWfZR32JsFIaUcwTqVM4xIfGM9\\_ \"metaESTATES_VILLA by LuisFern5\")\n\n![Creature House by Mila Lolli!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view\\&id=1-p8jY6yd64irLt4tY3kqC5Hx5O9wQLoK \"Creature House by Mila Lolli!\")\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**Mark** - Co-founder - Serial tech entrepreneur - launched multiple platforms to empower architects, designers and creators.

We’re planning to deliver a seamless experience by passing all the configurations and artwork defined prior to import directly into a user’s Scene, ready to deploy to their LAND.\n\nWe will start with integrating the MetaMundo marketplace with DCL via API to work directly with the Builder and DCL SDK. This will enable us to automate all the steps that are currently required from the user, like importing and configuration, and turn this into a single, more streamlined flow directly from the MetaMundo marketplace.\n\nOur servers we will store a safe backup of all the files acquired by the user. These servers will help us configure the files in the cloud enabling easier deployment of the data defined from the MetaMundo platform. Data will be sent between the server, the client and marketplace using traditional data requisition and JSON data transfer for complex data, and sensitive content will be secured under wallet validation using Web3 standards.\n\nWe plan to develop a library of interactions and ready-to-use features and plug-ins, built entirely in Typescript/Javascript to make it easier to interact with the DCL SDK. This way we can abstract part of the development work, and this layer will ensure we automate manual processes like positioning and configuring sub systems from the NFT. We’ll create a complete building system using cloud infrastructure with CI to ensure we can automatically test, run and iterate with assets under development.\n\nOur goal is to automate the model processing pipeline. It will go from high-fidelity 3D file to a DCL optimized version, we will create plugins for leading 3D software (Python scripts will be adapted for each software) that will have a faster iteration process, along with a complete CI system helping artists to validate their 3D work in the Decentraland environment without any friction (enabling a preview build easily from Blender and 3ds Max).\n\nHere are a few examples of interactive scenes by popular artists like Dutchtide, LuisFern5 and Mila Lolli that MetaMundo has helped optimize for use in Decentraland:\n\n![ZenGarden by Dutchtide!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view\\&id=1-ukbQAoh7USitMFCzs8C13fUd6PW9PhY \"ZenGarden by Dutchtide\")\n\n![metaESTATES_VILLA by LuisFern5!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view\\&id=1-lX7UaWfZR32JsFIaUcwTqVM4xIfGM9\\_ \"metaESTATES_VILLA by Luis Fern\")\n\n![Creature House by Mila Lolli!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view\\&id=1-p8jY6yd64irLt4tY3kqC5Hx5O9wQLoK \"Creature House by Mila Lolli\")\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**Mark** - Co-founder - Serial tech entrepreneur - launched multiple platforms to empower architects, designers and creators.

This will require a robust API to be able to directly integrate with Decentraland internal systems.\n\nDCL Emulation System (1 Month)\nThis step will emulate Decentraland using the native SDK and validate requirements to make sure it will be running in the best way possible. It will also make it possible to iterate faster by enabling everything to be tested without the need of manual export and import in the builder.\n\n3D File Conversion Pipeline (3/4 weeks)\nDevelopment of an 3D file conversion pipeline that will take master .FBX, .USD, or .OBJ files from creators and convert these files and optimize it into a DCL friendly .GLB file format ready to use immediately within DCL. This conversion pipeline will consider limitations such as size, poly count, materials, DCL Colliders, dimensions, land size constraints and components that are not supported in DCL.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c98ea4a0-fbaf-11ec-a32a-859962cd3c29)**",

Time to act!\nAnd so we did and are working on bringing the sport communities and the Web3 communities together.\nFootball (Every Sport in fact) and Web3 are communities - Our Fan Activation Network (FAN) platform brings the value back to the Clubs by granting Fans with governance, healthy games, a voice, unique NFTs and experiences money can't buy, IRL and in the metaverse.\nFan Activation Network is the first and only Web3 enabled platform that is valued around loyalty and not investment gambling such as the current so called Fan Engagement Coins companies. Over time, Sport Clubs will be owned by Private equity funds on the one hand and could, should and will be DAO by their constituencies on the other hand.\n\nWith our first Customer, French Federation of Rugby (best team in the world) we are building the Stade de France which hosts next year the World Cup , whereby the token holders will win access to crazy immersive moments with the players, parties, live interviews by the winner, joining them and singing in the cloak room altogether…\nOn top of the events we are working with the sensor developed by Decathlon (200G, no latency) to bring and enrich our earn to move games in the metaverse game studios.\nThat is part of our value proposition to the Olympics committee, where we are entering into the final stage of the selection process.\nWe’ll bring back the flame into the metaverse and you shall run with it too.

That part of the project is in stealth mode for now and will require a separate conversation.\n\nWe are the first entering in that loyalty Web3 format as we believe that working with and for the clubs and federations under a profit sharing model is just and fair. And again, only Blockchain enabled us to put engagement, Gaming, NFTs, Metaverse together in a very compelling value proposition for the younger generations of fans , as the average age keeps increasing. We believe sport is a good thing , that clubs and federations have a role to play so then only bringing up the environment that generates the emotions along today’s vector will reactivate the enthusiasm IRL .\nWe shall declare success when the Fans / Followers communities will win empowerment from being viewers, singers, clappers, to being partial owner, member of the governance, and drive the movement of a better health, better shape, better life that only the merge of physical and socially Metaversed  (today digital) practice do bring to mankind.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe are tracking both the technical management thru planning and testing as well as the business with the number of opportunities we can support.\n\nWIP :\n\n*   Registration: 90%\n*   Avatar Editor from Readyplayer.me\n*   Avatar Module from MGH: 50%\n*   Shop: 70%\n*   Play Pro mini games: 60%\n*   Smart Contracts: 40%\n\nTo be developed :\n\n*   My Profile\n*   Connect to Engage Pro\n*   Upgrade Level\n*   Marketplace\n*   Gaming Rules\n\nTools and methods :\n\n*   Registration / Onboarding\n    \\-- Integration with Beacon SDK\n*   Avatar Editor animated 3D\n    \\-- Unify and polygon compatible\n    \\-- Integration with provided SDK\n*   Avatar Module from MGH:\n    \\-- Developed in ThreeD.js\n    \\-- Compatible in Unity Engine\n*   Buy ATF Token:\n    \\-- Integration with on-ramp solution Wert SDK\n*   Shop pro :\n    \\-- Web view embedded in the native app\n*   Play pro\n    \\-- Integration with provided SDK\n    \\-- Developed in Unity\n*   Engage pro\n    \\-- Developed in Python\n    \\-- Web view embedded in the native app\n*   Train pro\n    \\-- Developed in Python\n    \\-- Data access through Kinesis\n\nOverall, MVP ready at 75% with some components being tested by up to 700 test users -\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/elie-simon-1995a713/ - Elie Simon\n30+ years of leadership positions across computer systems, software, storage and RFID.\nWinner of the E\\&Y France Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 2007, won after the turn around of Tagsys from quasi bankruptcy to being in the top 3 companies in the RFID Industry worldwide .\nLeader in disruptive Fintech, with GK8 amongst others that we sold in November last year.\nLast but not least with Sun being the dot in dot com, we led the introduction of Internet to the extent my web3 friends call me Web1 !\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/bilal-el-alamy/ - Bilal El Alamy\nStrong history as researcher in statistical physics and as data scientist\nExperienced leader and trusted advisor in blockchain, crypto-finance, NFTs and petaverse/metaverse\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/walid-benothman-81abb41/ - Walid Benothman\nExperienced leader in the digital finance industry.

    "body": "> by 0x7616e594f1832d0dc7aad3923967d76fd98416e2 (BBStudios)\n\nShould the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nART|DAO is a battle concept that pits two artists' submissions against each other. The winner sells their art to the DAO.  DCL players show up to the battles and vote using a custom implementation of POAP booths and scoreboards.  I run a podcast called ART|DAI on TokenSmart which happens during the battle which attracts extra players.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xd5879eCb96DF9a3c4584d7e1A49Ee53ba94104D3\n\n## Description\n\nWe will use the $3000 to purchase the winner's art up to $250 per battle(1/week) for 3 months.  This will be an important time(summer for the U.S.) to continue to attract/grow the player base in DCL.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe'll be bringing on celebrity curators for the battles,  participants(voters) will also be encouraged to take screenshots and tag DCL on Twitter for extra prizes.  At the end of the 3 months the grant wallet will have 12 pieces from artists, which we can either keep or transfer to the DCL DAO.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n@bake_eth is my co-founder and helps with the overall UX\nYou can check out https://artordai.xyz to see battles already completed or stop by (38,103) to see the set.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nGiven the set's proximity to marketplaces in DCL, I will attempt to engage them to receive further sponsorship.  The community will see players' screenshots of the battles on a weekly basis and will have access to .csv files from the POAP's for verification if needed.\n\nThe key component here is staying true to #web3 and rewarding artists for their content. All grant money will be spent on purchasing works of art for the DAO. At the end of the 3 months we will apply for another larger grant if the concept proves to be popular. Any left over money at the end of the 3 months will be used on extra battles.  Any remaining proceeds(after applicable taxes) collected from the sale of art from the DAO will fund new battles.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=dc2986b0-f958-11ec-a32a-859962cd3c29)**",

The main purpose of this page is to make easier for the everyday user to know more about the current events of the day, with informative short videos about the events details and artist's background (if any performing). Think of it as the live events list, but with subtitled videos explaining them.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xBD03aDd5da0e173C67C9C1073FFBA017147c42d4\n\n## Description\n\nOne thing we noticed is that somedays it can get hard to keep track of events! Our goal is to make the event page more digestable for the average user, by visually explaining the activities of the day.\n\nCurrently we're doing at least 3x subtitled videos per day, the next step is doubling that. Our goal is to bring more awareness to the whole community overall.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nIf the grant is approved, we will expand further the team to keep covering the entire events page every single day. We still aim to create translated videos to the Brazilian audience and expand to tiktok.  We will also invest in paid ads for both pages monthly.\n\nTwitter page: https://twitter.com/DclHighlights\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nMy name is Vapo and I create videos by myself. I've been working fulltime in metaverse-related content since december 2021, contributing with videos and advertisement in different projects.\n\nMy objective is to become a steady source of video news about Decentraland events. I want to continue creating relevant content everyday in multiple platforms to bring new users and keep current players updated as much as possible!\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe aim to post new daily subtitled videos in multiple platforms.\n\nUpdate: We have reached over 10.000 views in our daily videos with over 100+ published - providing content for anyone who submits an event, and the official @decentraland twitter profile is also following us!\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=18f3e990-f8b5-11ec-a32a-859962cd3c29)**",

The contest partners are globally renowned design media, crypto media, worldwide designers' community, student councils top universities. The contest judges are academics from top universities, well-known designers, crypto artists, and crypto funding angels. The media exposure of the competition has been over 5 million. Members of the DCL community can participate together in the award ceremony and exhibition. Talking about the importance of great content creation for the metaverse and its future development expectations.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n20,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x8c127AB5762CB50C993a198b6187c0833746e404\n\n## Description\n\n\"Kaleidoverse\" comes from \"kaleidoscope\" and \"metaverse\", indicating a glimpse of the huge universe from a small space. With a kaleidoscope in hand, some people see the abyss in the sky, while others see nothing in everything. We encourage creators to find their own worlds and to create their own wonderful universe.​\nSince its launch, the competition has received a great number of outstanding creators from all over the world. The creators bravely and creatively expressed their own vision of \"Kaleidoverse\" in their designs. Hundreds of wonderful works have been collected in each track, including future metaverse fashion items, metaverse products with multiple values and innovations, and also delicate space design, exploring the boundaries of space design in the metaverse. We believe that these works represent the expectations of many creators for the future metaverse, and we believe that these works can realize their value and make a contribution to the metaverse. We'd like to help make them visible to more people, giving outstanding creators a chance to make their mark in the metaverse and help add more innovation to the industry.​\n\n***Why sponsor this competition?***\n\n**1. Increase DCL's exposure and popularity in the design community.**\nWe have collaborated with many art & design communities, media, software, and institutions, which bring excellent entries and a lot of exposure as well. Here we list part of the partners and their media coverage:\n![avatar](https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1MBzzfT3MZ2HIgDARJkoCQUOT2Rcg-UTW=w2880-h1396-iv2)\nIf DCL becomes one of the sponsors of this competition, this competition will bring a large number of new users and new content creators to DCL, which would definitely make our DCL's community more popular and active.\n\n**2. Increase DCL's visibility among the student community (Gen Z) and become their first choice to enter the metaverse.**\nThe competition has partnered with many prestigious art school student associations, including RCA, GSA, UAL, MAU, Pratt, LSE, etc. These schools will be promoting the contest on their social media accounts. If DCL sponsors these activities, it will become known among the art student group.\n\n**3. The excellent works in the competition will be exhibited or achieved in DCL on a priority basis. Quality content will help DCL attract more users and facilitate its dissemination.**\nAny quality metaverse works produced in the competition will have priority to be exhibited or achieved in DCL. For example, excellent clothing works will be made into wearable devices, and excellent space designs will be achieved in the land of DCL.\n\n**4. The DCL community will receive some Kaleidoverse Memorial Badge for the competition and will be available at Opensea. (See badge on the contest website below)**\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe detail of \"Kaleidoverse\" contest: https://kaleidoverse.beamstudio.pro/\n\nThe total cost for the contest is around $50,000. The other sponsors we work with provide us with $30,000, and we hope DCL could provide us with $20,000. The sponsorship money provided by DCL will be used for the prize money for the winners and for the award ceremony and exhibition.\n\n**BUDGET**\n![avatar](https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1TCe7TUkv9N1PE-yyTU3RwQaL8hhT496V=w2880-h1578-iv2)\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**Allen Ding**: Founding Partner of Nothing Research and BlockHive, a blockchain fund; Former Chief Analyst at Huobi Group; Former Head of Staking Operations at Huobi Group.\n\n**Axel Kilian**: Visiting Assistant Professor at the MIT Department of Architecture, former Assistant Professor at Princeton University and at the Delft University of Technology\n\n**Dr. John Stevens**: Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) at Royal College of Art, and core staff member on the Global Innovation Design, a dual master's program at RCA and Imperial College\n\n**Dr. Nicolás Rebolledo**: Head of Service Futures Lab and Tutor in Service Design MA at the Royal College of Art.

    "body": "> by 0x9ff256f65fa594ccdc13d76f116c87d9defd8a1c (Stripcheese#8a1c)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAt MetaPlay, we are creating one of the first intelligent & independent virtual companions. This was made possible by embedding an innovative state-of-the-art AI code into our first chicken NFTs. The CryptoChicken plays and interacts with the owner and its environment, bridging the gap of static pets with limited functionality in the Metaverse. Our team currently has a small staff of talented individuals with a variety of significant capabilities. Each member comes from multiple types of professional formations such as finance, web development, and business studies, besides having worked with multiple noteworthy businesses. Our vision is to empower Decentraland's community with smart and interactive pets that have yet to tread on this land.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x01F0b8e92F0ca0398482C265a99612196c8782fE\n\n## Description\n\nHello fellow Decentralanders! We are MetaPlay®, a newly founded NFT development company with the desire to innovate and expand the horizons of Decentraland and the metaverse as a whole. Our first NFT project is called TheCryptoChickenCollective. (For a sample, go check out the info on specifications below!) With this project, we are fulfilling a major desire for Decentraland's user base, which is the need for having a companion animal that follows you around. Our chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!\n\nTheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating one of Decentraland's first pets that moves independent of the users avatar motions. In addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect its overall statistics. As our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another right in Decentraland! Side note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) a real possibility in the near future \"winky face\".\n\nWe believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL. While we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest. Although we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap!\n\nUpon all the amazing feedback we received on our last proposal we have made significant changes to the funding request for our project. Originally our project asked for 240k for development which we believe could greatly benefit not only this project but Decentraland as a whole by way of the technological advances our project proves to bring in the near future. With that said, we fully understand and acknowledge the concerns some had regarding our lack of history in DCL and giving such a large grant to a brand new project. For this reason we have elected to reduce our original asking amount by 75%. With this new grant we strongly believe we can develop this project into one which we calculate could bring up to 1000+ new Daily Active Users to DCL. The 60k will spend as follows over a 6 month period.\n\n20k backend development = 3,3k/month\n\n10K graphics + animation = 1.6k/month\n\n5k web development = 800$/month\n\n15k marketing = 2.5k/month\n\n5k  Discord maintenance = 900$/month\n\n5k  Miscellaneous development expenses = 900$/month\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOur developer and designer are world class professionals with over 30 years of experience in their respective industries. Our designer has done animation and graphics for a variety of television, film and corporate projects and our developer has played a key role in the development of software for NASA, Unity, and Lightwave 3D. Due to the proprietary nature of the coding we are unable to disclose the exact manner in which we achieved the animated companions but we hope that our current example on our Land (22,89) will prove to be enough evidence that we know what we are doing and can deliver everything promised in a timely manner. Basically we created a cool looking chicken that, while in the beta testing phase, anyone can try out and enjoy within our C.C.C. partnered LAND and the project's upcoming partners. To check out what all the hype is about please visit our land at: ChickenLand (22,89) (link provided below) (INSTRUCTIONS: Click the red box on the corner, wait for it to turn green, then go to the middle statue and click \"summon your chicken\". Disclaimer: we have yet to add additional AI functionalities and coloring to the chicken, but will do so immediately following our first drop. The first drop will be a wearable in the form of a gold chain that enables your pet chicken to show up behind you once equipped on your avatar.)\n\nFor more detailed information pertaining to our project please visit The Crypto Chicken\nCollective whitepaper: https://docs.metaplay.cafe/\n\nAny and all updates on our project will be relayed through the following channels:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/\\_CryptoChickens\n\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/8VwaMV3vcw\n\nProject’s links: https://linktr.ee/cryptochickencollective (Website is still under construction... brand new website coming soon!!!)\n\nFor access to The Crypto Chicken Collective official land plot click the link below:\nDecentraland ChickenLand: https://play.decentraland.org/?island=I1be6x\\&position=22%2C89\\&realm=dg\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n@Trag (CTO) ➺ software architect with over 30 years of experience in every aspect of the game industry, from high speed server design to graphics and gameplay.

We both want to see an open-source alternative to Meta. We also know that there's a lot of work to be done to get there.\nThis proposal is our first step towards that vision.\n\n### Vision\n\nWe would love to see a thriving community of Decentraland game creators enabled by an ecosystem of tools that support them. Besides the original 3D client developed by the Decentraland Foundation, we think that 2D experiences should definitely be a part of this ecosystem, and we want to take the lead in creating such tools.\nThe long-term vision for this project is to allow the community to easily create 2D retro games on Decentraland, with enough flexibility to support multiple types of 2D games.\nTo achieve this, we propose first building a prototype of an independent 2D retro client to walk around Decentraland, including scenes and some wearables.\n\n![Pixel art character concept art](https://d3da1k6uo8tbjf.cloudfront.net/edd84342-f714-11ec-8fd8-b2d1a80aa527?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22PixelArtCharacter%20Presentados.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27PixelArtCharacter%2520Presentados.png\\&response-content-type=image%2Fpng\\&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\\&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAS5PME4CT5QW2PJJU%2F20220628%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4\\_request\\&X-Amz-Date=20220628T204139Z\\&X-Amz-Expires=86400\\&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\\&X-Amz-Signature=c436f20009faf4e0ef686af1913333050cc54a4c078150cb4cc1c27a2f163974\\&Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9kM2RhMWs2dW84dGJqZi5jbG91ZGZyb250Lm5ldC9lZGQ4NDM0Mi1mNzE0LTExZWMtOGZkOC1iMmQxYTgwYWE1Mjc~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\\_\\&Signature=qNUO6ENCDRXzJZGNR2al2iXX7u10HSsaaPB0N0mam-l~LmIUByjxSL5cNrViDmxLbAy32rTPJRYXUK44QR51puMUAvkl0C6DOUJGcCVJ7YH7H6nW-6HFxqgbTeuiVW0NESrBzP4i85kJovCeIa0E5dqeGcFndlG0STktmb07DeLANrPY25kcxxPlL7p7E6TwP8dA7ImMaSOL0LeA76Lq6MAwnSOlsPiaSBCIlZwbsHxzNxSjENh1MiyOGnAXKTodCuhSwhk-636A-HCk4PIaHrVplCbEjR6sioO65jYhtYubmwjHIbW36IoqlPCnyk7Z4gZq5BFa63YXvo7etyjREA\\_\\_\\&Key-Pair-Id=K2BMZZDBFKKL41)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nIn order to enable the creation of 2D retro-style games we need an alternative 2D top-down Decentraland client, and that's where we want to start.\n\nYou may be wondering how it’s even possible to allow 2D games in Decentraland. [The Decentraland Protocol](https://docs.decentraland.org/content-intro/) consists of various layers. LANDs hold the scenes published by land-owners, which players can explore using the official 3d client. However, the protocol doesn’t specify what scenes are, or how the scenes are rendered. The official client is just **one** of many possible implementations. The magic of open-source and open protocols is that **anyone** can create their own client, with their own graphics and rendering. Currently, only the [3d web explorer by the Decentraland Foundation](https://play.decentraland.org/) exists, and a [VR client is being developed via a DAO grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8fe0e0a0-d62b-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0). A prototype by maraoz shows [it’s possible to create an alternative isometric 3D client too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6rGeAuPcno). What we want to create is the base layer for anyone who wants to create 2d content.\n\n![Visual Inspiration 1](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5efc0159f9a97ba05a8b2902/5f1a8cef64b347eced83456f_test-play.jpg)\n![Visual Inspiration 1](https://scontent.faep24-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/274149700\\_3735892699868507\\_512428938455866077\\_n.jpg?stp=cp0\\_dst-jpg_e15\\_q65\\_s640x640&\\_nc_cat=103\\&ccb=1-7&\\_nc_sid=110474&\\_nc_ohc=zdQFhDucLmQAX_WjGSI&\\_nc_ht=scontent.faep24-1.fna\\&oh=00\\_AT96mUUF0djP8ImKuLTBalVHobI8mgr7dGfJsfli72rkpA\\&oe=62C136F0)\n\nThe main features for the prototype client and 2D SDK/CLI are:\n\n1.  An avatar that supports some of the native Decentraland character customizations.\n2.  A top-down 2D rendering of the existing scene contents that you can explore with your avatar (without, for now, the ability to interact with 3D content).\n3.  The ability to add 2D tiles/assets to lands through a CLI. Definition of a protocol to support defining 2D scenes and assets in Decentraland.\n4.  A tutorial explaining how assets and scenes can be created by the community using our SDK/CLI.\n5.  Base avatar movement that would allow the player to navigate the 2D version of Decentraland.\n\nWith these features in place, we think we'll be in a good spot to start creating tools to implement gameplay on top of the 2D client.\n\nAs a byproduct of this prototype, we want to publish a Rust crate (software development package) to wrap Decentraland Catalyst's REST API. This way other Rust developers will be able to interact with Decentraland easily.\n\nOut of scope for this prototype:\n\n*   Scene logic (execute Javascript for 3D or 2D scene content).\n*   Interaction with 3D scene content from 2D client.\n*   Implementing a 2D sample game.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**[frantufro](https://frantufro.com)** is a game and software developer with 20 years of experience and the owner and director of [Hidden People Club](https://hiddenpeople.club), a small game development team located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Part of the team was responsible for [Nubarron](https://store.steampowered.com/app/414160/Nubarron_The_adventure_of_an_unlucky_gnome/).\n\nTwo members of Hidden People Club – **loomstyla** (developer) and **camiloer** (artist) – will be focusing full time on the project, and Fran will work on the core architecture and project management.\n\n**maraoz** - Founder of OpenZeppelin and early contributor to Decentraland. Will oversee that the project’s vision is aligned with the Decentraland community. <https://github.com/maraoz>\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe believe we can finish this project in 6 months.\n\nWe will use the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/) as a starting point, because we believe it will help us get to the prototype stage faster than implementing everything ourselves. Bevy is a free and open-source game engine in Rust. After the prototype is done we can evaluate if Bevy is the way to go or something different is required long-term.\n\nThe main milestones are:\n\n1.  **JUL** Implementing catalyst-rs, a Rust crate to interact with Decentraland’s Catalyst API, focusing on data consumption for lands and avatars first (what we need for this prototype).\n2.  **AUG-SEP** Implementing the automatic 3D to 2D object rendering of a single scene.\n3.  **NOV** Implementing the renderer to support moving around Decentraland.\n4.  **DEC-JAN** Implementing the avatar renderer with support for native wearables and basic movement.\n5.  **JAN** Documentation on how players can add 2D assets to their lands with a reference scene.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1959b490-f726-11ec-805c-77efd746e6b7)**",

The Sandstorm team has already received inquiries about independent 3D artists for hire.\n\n*   We host a live show 5x times a week inside the Sandbox that are focused around builder tutorials, creator highlights, and live interviews with NFT projects and Legacy Brands that are creating experiences in the Metaverse. We will begin hosting live shows inside our Decentraland Social Hub once construction is complete in 3-6 months. POAPS are created and minted for each event.\n\n*   We hold themed builder competitions once every two weeks with prizes of up to 5,000 SAND going to the winners (prize money funded by the Sandbox). The submissions and voting process are all broadcast live from our Twitch steam.\n\n*   28 builders on our platform have been offered contract- and full-time roles to create experiences and assets that can be used on Metaverse LAND.\n\n*   The Sandstorm team has employed another 10 independent artists to help us fulfill projects for our partners.

We want players new and old journey a road less travelled from common highlighted scenes to find the hidden gems within Decentraland  just as we have done within the video guides and creator features on our channel.\n\nTo add attraction to the scene and ensure players visit we aim to change the scene regularly and update the content, but we believe a P2E element will set the scene apart and encourage players to compete for tokens which they exchange for NFTs and eventually wearables.\n\nThis grant is to build upon the help we have already given to thousands of people and kickstart a front facing scene within Decentraland that players old and new can enjoy.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x1816E73A6C50E8913047A9400b7DF822F7C666dF\n\n## Description\n\nDabPlay is a YouTube channel that began in October 2021. We have produced guides, reviews and helped content creators and players navigate the Decentraland metaverse. To date >25,000 viewers have found our Decentraland videos.\n\nWe have always taken the stance of helping out others but now we need the help of the DCL community so that we can purchase a LAND parcel.\n\nProposal:\nOur LAND will be used to promote content creators, events and a healthy positive community feel as we help players navigate the DCL MetaVerse into areas less travelled.\nThis will be through our most popular guides being streamed in scene as well teleportation pads to featured scenes encouraging players to go off and explore the gems of Decentraland.\n\nDabPlay is a YouTube channel so we don't have a lot to offer for a P2E element so we have partnered with a new NFT project called MetaDuckies NFT. This project creates 3D model duckies that have utility.\n\nCurrently the models are viewable in 3D and can be used in Metaverse houses / scenes as displayed collectibles. In the future these models will form part of NFT smart contracts where the holder can utilise their NFTs in the P2E game we want to build.\n\nThe P2E element will be similar to fruit catcher but themed around our partners and the project. We can't share more on this openly in case ideas are taken should our bid be unsuccessful but we will provide more info on this shortly.  The idea is that players will win tokens by playing the game which they can exchange for NFTs and eventually wearables.\n\nUs:\nWe are a small team of 4 and have invested hundreds of hours into upskilling ourselves in 3D modelling and are starting now develop game concepts. We have made friends in the community who have provided invaluable help and guidance helping us to better understand the technical elements of scene building though we still have a way to go in building a fully functioning game. We believe nothing is out of reach and our creativity will allow us to build something amazing for the community to enjoy. We are realistic in understanding we have a lot to learn and will document the experience to help other growing scene creators thus, giving back to the DCL creator community.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe will only have one parcel, so space for us will be limited and we intend to build upwards to maximise the space. We have been working on our design concept for a while of how the scene would look and have good working experience of using blender and builder which we will utilise if successful to build the scene.\n\nVideo boards will showcase scenes that we have discovered and encourage players to explore them through teleportation pads. Whilst help bots will provide insights about new events to encourage attendance and discourage bots / exploits and raise awareness of Metaverse safety.\n\nIn order to overcome technical challenges we intend to join the Last Slice Co so that we can contribute to the wider DCL creator community and utilise wider skills and expertise to build the best possible scene for Decentraland players and visitors.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nDabPlay: (Team of 4) - Scene building, P2E concepts and community engagement\nMetaDuckiesNFT: - NFT creation, NFT utility and P2E integration\nCyclopa: Technical advice and guidance\n\nOutsource: CodEX - We will personally fund development of coding for the P2E element.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nIf successful:\n\n*   Month 1: Finalisation of our scene concept and begin design phase and scaling to bring the build to life.\n*   Month 2 and 3 will see the video boards and help tools deployed whilst we work on the teleportation pads and continue producing DCL content for the community.\n    Once deployed and with an active scene we will be working on the P2E element of a game and integration with MetaDuckiesNFT's creations for prizes and gameplay deployment in ALPHA testing.\n\nBETA Testing will be set for a go live in early 2023.\n\nThese milestones are set to be achievable and realistic as we are a small team and still learning as we go.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2530aa60-f647-11ec-805c-77efd746e6b7)**",

    "title": "Endless Mafia",
    "body": "> by 0x9f9d3024bc0d05f7e9330ac0a0d50057b511c63b\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe’re seeking funding for the development of a party game. The game is Mafia – social deduction game, modeling a conflict between two groups, the mafiosi and villagers. The game has two alternating phases: first, a night phase, during which those with night killing powers may covertly kill other players, and second, a day phase, in which surviving players debate the identities of players and vote to eliminate a suspect.\nFor now, we want to create a simple working build, to see how it works and see community reaction. If it receives good feedback, we will continue development, create 3d models, polish and add more mechanics to it.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,200 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x7dC0c1E2F54b619B423104c77c9783B1716640a5\n\n## Description\n\nMafia is a social deduction game about a conflict between two groups of people, playing against each other during two alternating phases. In a classic version of the game, win conditions are met by eliminating the opponent group. But we want to make it possible to join a game instance that has already started.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nGame mechanic\n\nMinimum is 4 players. A game is usually played by 7-16 people. With fewer players games tend to be too short, with more players – game loses meaning. For this version 4 players for a start should be enough.\nA player get near a table, click on it, gets a message in a window if he is able to join a game instance. Users are able to join during a certain phase of the game. If there are not enough players in a game instance, the user will receive a message that he has to wait until more people join.\n\nZero phase – Players are waiting when there will be enough people to join. Players receive roles. Roles are assigned randomly, max number of mafia is limited by a formula:  M  = N / K\nWhere M = number of mafia members. N = all players. K = minimum players.\nFirst phase – Night. Mafia picks a victim silently by voting collectively. A majority of votes defines a victim. If the mafia does not reach consensus within a given period of time, no one gets killed.\nSecond phase – Day. A victim gets the final word, allowed to talk for a minute, and then gets kicked out of the game. During this period, anyone can join. New players get roles. Mafia gets informed what roles new players get.\nThen everyone has a discussion, and votes for accusing a player of being a mafia member. A player accused by a majority of players gets excluded.\n\nIf a mafia member disconnects, this mafia member will be announced as dead. If a villager disconnects, the villager will be announced as dead. The game continues as long as there are still mafia members and villagers, and there are less mafia members than villagers.\n\nAfter the games ends, users get info about games results. A new round begins, players get new roles. If there are not enough players, players get the message that they should wait for 2-3 players.\n\nNew players that just entered a game will be given the roles of villagers or mafiosi, villagers are not going to know what roles are given to new players, or players that rejoined a game. That way, it will make it easier for people to find people to play with, users won’t have to look for another lobby if there is an already going game.\n\nIf within a single scene, several games will be played, voice chat can be disturbing, so it will be blocked within a scene.\n\nPlanned features\n\nThis project, aside from Mafia gameplay, will introduce an ability to kick people from a scene via a voting system. Currently, in Decentraland to kick users, one, or a few predefined users have to be given admin rights, which is convenient for small events, but not for an extended period of time.\nVoting to kick players that are ruining others' experience from a scene can help people to moderate scenes, to have a better time playing.\nWe plan to give the Decentraland community one more place, where people can play and interact with each other, to create a meaningful scene.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nWe are M-social Production, web and web3 developers, we have been doing digital projects since 2008.\nThere will be 4 people engaged in development:\n\n*   Frontend dev\n*   Backend dev\n*   QA specialist\n*   Project manager\n\nIf you want to know more about our experience, you can visit our website: https://msocialproduction.com\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe expect a working alpha to be done within 3 weeks.\nWithin 2 weeks, we plan to make the functional code. Next, we will test it and fix bugs that will pop up. We’re not planning to create a 3d model for interior and exterior for the alpha version.\nTo give players a motivation to join back into a game instance, and to motivate users to play in general, we plan to implement a play-to-earn mechanic. Players will gain points for surviving a set number of phases, and for meeting win conditions. Play-to-earn mechanic can be further improved.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7c213df0-f62c-11ec-805c-77efd746e6b7)**",

    "title": "Wearables Working Group: Attach VP to Limited # of L1 Wearable Collections",
    "body": "> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Wearables Working Group: Attach VP to Limited # of L1 Wearable Collections](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ee6b1b90-d7fc-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal calls for attaching voting power to the original six official DCL L1 wearable collections, released in 2019. This includes :1) Community Contest; 2) DCL Launch; 3) Exclusive Masks; 4) Halloween 2019; 5) MCH Collection; & 6) Xmas 2019.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe question of attaching Voting Power (VP) to wearables is an important issue to members of the Decentraland community. To date, there have been at least four (4) proposals surrounding this topic. All of those that passed were approved before the introduction of the three-stage binding governance proposal process. The hope is that the solution proposed herein meets the demands of wearable stakeholders, and is both accepted by other stakeholders and viewed as technically feasible due to its limited application to only the six (6) first and official Decentraland wearables collections.\n\nPreviously passed proposals include:\n\n*   On June 14, 2022, a non-binding poll to “Get voting power for your current L1 wearables and strengthen the wider community DAO participation” passed with 1,442,355 VP (76%/52 votes) in favor; 437,946 VP (24%/10 votes) against. This poll established initial community support for attaching VP to L1 wearables, without detailing specific implementation pathways or a detailed impact assessment. It additionally called for a subsequent proposal to determine a tiered VP allocation system based on the rarity category of items.\n\n*   On June 26, 2022, a subsequent non-binding poll for “L1 Ethereum Wearables Voting Power Allocation Proposal” passed, with 2,920,657 VP (96%/55 votes) in favor; 146,49 VP (4%/9 votes) against. This poll did not contain any specific information on implementation pathways or impact assessment, however, it built on the previous poll, calling for distribution of VP to L1 wearables based on rarity level along the following parameters:\n\nMythic: 1000 VP\n\nLegendary: 100 VP\n\nEpic: 10 VP\n\nRare: 5 VP\n\nUncommon: 1 VP\n\nThe argument against attaching VP to L1 wearables has been primarily technical, with both the DAO Committee and other knowledgeable community members pointing to three primary challenges: First, the broad technical scale of attaching VP to wearables that are distributed across X# collections, all of which are held on separate contracts. Second, is the arbitrary distinction between L1 and L2 wearables, particularly given future conflicts that could arise due to emerging technologies that reduce L1 transaction fees (i.e. zK roll-ups and sidechains) or enable easy bridging of assets between L1 and L2. Third, is the fact that L1 wearables outside of the collections officially sold by DCL involved p2p transactions in which no MANA was burned from the ecosystem, and would effectively be creating double VP for these transactions.\n\nThis proposal aims to account for all of these critiques. After conducting an in depth analysis of L1 wearables, total/active voting power, and other VP-allocating assets - including LAND, MANA and Names - we have determined that while a blanket application of VP to all L1 wearables is impractical and difficult to justify, limiting the application to the OG6 official collections is justifiable quantitatively - accounting for nearly 70% of all L1 wearables; technically - being limited to only six (6) wearable collections; and qualitatively - linking VP to official DCL collections, with the amount of VP reasonably comparable to the amount of MANA spent/burned to purchase the one OG collection (Halloween 2019) that was officially sold (rather than given away) to the community.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal seeks to resolve the issue of wearables VP, which has been a point of contention since passage of the first non-binding poll in June 2022. It aims to provide an implementation pathway that distributes wearable VP in as equitable a way as possible, while mitigating technical blockers. It further fulfills a demand that was made by the community with a relatively strong level of support, equating to nearly 20% of historical VP, however, was not enacted by the DAO committee because there was no clear implementation pathway.\n\nWhile there was no initial promise of VP with purchase of early L1 wearables, assets from the Halloween 2019 collection remain the only officially-sponsored asset in which MANA was spent by community members, burned by the Foundation, and is not associated with any form of VP. The problem with some past solutions proposed by wearable stakeholders to attach VP to ALL L1 wearables is that, a) it is incredibly arduous to implement, particularly when considering distributing VP by rarity of each collection; b) it is somewhat arbitrary in that there is no precedent for such a VP-generating act; and c) In the majority of cases it would in fact be creating double VP in that wearables were purchased in a p2p transaction in which no MANA was burned, so the seller would have received MANA equating to VP and the buyer a wearable equating to VP. As a result of the above, an all encompassing L1 solution is technically impractical and both quantitatively and qualitatively difficult to justify.\n\nThe Halloween 2019 collection, however, was the first wearable collection after the Exclusive Masks beta, and the only collection partially sold by the Decentraland Foundation, raising 1,077,320 MANA in sales. Although subsequent collections in the 2019 wearable offerings were distributed for free or as a reward, this spent MANA, which was removed from the ecosystem, has not received any democratic utility. By attaching VP to these “initial offering” wearable collections (and only to these initial six), which are the foundation of the robust wearables market we see today, this proposal aims to assert wearables as an essential asset class - similar to MANA, LAND, and Names.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAttach voting power, distributed by rarity to the six (6) official Decentraland wearable collections released in 2019. This includes:\n\n1.  Community Contest\n2.  DCL Launch\n3.  Exclusive Masks\n4.  Halloween 2019\n5.  MCH Collection\n6.  Xmas 2019\n\n*   There are 48,620 total wearables in these six collections, spread across 7,583 wallets. This equates to nearly 70% of the 71,082 total L1 wearables, which are spread across 10,442 unique wallets.\n\nVP will be distributed according to rarity as follows:\n\n*   Mythic: 1000 VP\n\n*   Legendary: 100 VP\n\n*   Epic: 10 VP\n\n*   Rare: 5 VP\n\n*   Uncommon: 1 VP\n\n*   There are 644 mythic across 189 unique wallets; 4,249 Legendary across 827 unique wallets; 17,382 Epic across 4,820 unique wallets; and 24,713 rares across 4,126 unique wallets.\n\nIn total this will create **1,796,691 VP**. This equates to less than 10% of the historically active VP in the DAO, and is less than 2x the amount of MANA spent (and burned) by community members to purchase Halloween 2019 wearables from the Decentraland Foundation.\n\n\\[Impacts & Implementation pathways are available for discussion on the Forum (https://forum.decentraland.org/t/draft-cumulative-layer-1-wearables-vp-proposal/11423), and will be included in the final Binding Governance Proposal]\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe underlying philosophy behind this proposal is that creating new VP and expanding participation in the DAO is inherently positive! Empowering various stakeholder groups makes our overall system more robust, and if anything, voter apathy is more of a risk than interest group consolidation of power - which this proposed pathway also mitigates by limiting the amount of VP that is being created as part of this process, by restricting it to particular L1 collections.\n\nThere is some concern, however, that restricting VP to the original six 2019 collections increasingly favors a particular sector of the Decentraland Community, that already has significant holdings when compared to newer entries into the ecosystem. One mitigation pathway would be to extend voting power to official L1 collections from 2020 as well; or as has been discussed previously, to apply VP to all L1 wearables, regardless of collection. These mechanisms are however not under consideration as part of this current proposal, and should this proposal fail, could be reconsidered by the Wearables VP Working Group.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe Snapshot Voting Strategy for this proposal will be configured as follows:\n\n{\n\"symbol\": \"WEARABLE\",\n\"collections\": \\[\n\"0x32b7495895264ac9d0b12d32afd435453458b1c6\",\n\"0xd35147be6401dcb20811f2104c33de8e97ed6818\",\n\"0xc04528c14c8ffd84c7c1fb6719b4a89853035cdd\",\n\"0xc1f4b0eea2bd6690930e6c66efd3e197d620b9c2\",\n\"0xf64dc33a192e056bb5f0e5049356a0498b502d50\",\n\"0xc3af02c0fd486c8e9da5788b915d6fff3f049866\"\n],\n\"multipliers\": {\n\"mythic\": 1000,\n\"legendary\": 100,\n\"epic\": 10,\n\"rare\": 5,\n\"uncommon\": 1\n}\n}\n\nA draft version of the strategy - which will be reviewed and can be implemented if this measure passes the binding governance proposal stage - can be found at the following link:\nhttps://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/pull/606\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese six (6) original wearable collections from 2019 are the final group of initial offering assets that have no associated VP. Other assets in this category include MANA, LAND and Names. What unites these assets are the fact that they are tied to either the core Decentraland smart contracts, or were linked to a foundation-led asset sale in which MANA was burned or the assets were distributed freely to early project adopters.\n\nVoting in favor of this proposal is meant to put a close to the question of creating additional voting power assets in the future. This final section of the proposal should be referred to if there are further attempts to use past precedent as an argue for extending VP to additional asset sets or categories.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=16aa0de0-f405-11ec-b5fc-5178246a05ac)**",

Since joining Decentraland University district in 2019, we shared its social and cultural potential by inviting artists to present their works in a virtual and decentralised environment. Through hosting special events, we seek to interact with curators, creatives, and experts, as well as to open our exhibition program to the public for their enjoyment, education, and collective experience. Thanks to the DAO support, we aim to continue curating and offering digital art exhibitions until January 2023.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n35,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x9645b4C1bFd6eb2647E7Fb8B74Db8F79F862Ea9e\n\n## Description\n\nThe Museum of Contemporary Digital Art (MoCDA) is a museum platform founded in 2019. We seek to support the digital art category by documenting, collecting and advancing the position of digital art in a global context through unique curatorial insight and education.\n\nOur team features experienced curators who share the ambition of providing many exciting opportunities to learn about the creative potential of digital tools, including the metaverse. In the past two years, we curated international art shows around the world including New York, London, Istanbul and Venice. MoCDA hosted many special events aimed at presenting and discussing what makes digital culture and art unique.\nWe bring our expertise in opening IRL exhibitions to the metaverse by experimenting with unique features that Decentraland offers to curators and artists alike. We are always seeking innovative ways to diversify and expand the platform.\n\nWe have organised several special exhibitions at the University District in Decentraland over the past two years, welcoming thousands of visitors. Three of the most recent exhibitions we opened:\n“Digital Embodiments And Interventions: The Sculptural World of Marjan Moghaddam” (4th June-10th September 2021), solo show featuring a selection of works by pioneering artist Marjan Moghaddam\n“Memento Minti - If you stop contributing, you will be forgotten” (8th January-27th March 2022), group show featuring Jisu Choe, Dancevatar, Silvio Lorusso, Nicolas Sassoon and Sasha Stiles\n“(Do Not) Touch” (8th April-2nd July 2022), group show featuring Sasha Katz, Baron Lanteigne and Martina Menegon\nThese exhibitions attracted thousands of visitors. For example, “Memento Minti”’s POAP was collected 1600+ times in the first two days and “(Do Not) Touch” collected 1200+ times within the first hour.\nThe work of our dedicated team for each Decentraland exhibition involves preliminary research, installation planning and curatorial strategies.\n\nOur curators will always plan at least three special events associated with each exhibition. This will enable more opportunities for visitors to visit the show and take full advantage of Decentraland’s space as a social environment, where people from diverse backgrounds can gather to enjoy art and interact with one another.\n\nTo learn more about the upcoming exhibitions, please visit this link: https://bit.ly/3Oza000\n\nWebsite & Social Media Links:\nhttps://www.mocda.org/\nhttps://twitter.com/MOCDA\\_/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mocda\\_/\n\nFeel free to get in touch with us by DM or email at info@mocda.org\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe funds from DAO will allow us to design and install exhibitions in our building located within Decentraland University, the educational district.

That’s a 150% increase in geo-coverage compared to the current one.\\\nhttps://support.ramp.network/en/articles/433-supported-countries-and-territories\n\nLower transaction fees\\\nUsers could purchase $MANA and $MATIC at a much lower cost. Ramp charges 2.9% for card payments compared to the current provider’s 3.9-5.5% (depending on currency).\\\nhttps://support.ramp.network/en/articles/431-transaction-fees\n\nAlmost 4x higher limits\\\nUsers could purchase 375% the amount of crypto through Ramp then the current provider. Monthly limits would increase from 20.000EUR to 75.000EUR.\\\nhttps://support.ramp.network/en/articles/441-kyc-limits\n\nSimplified KYC\\\nWith Ramp there’s no KYC required for <100EUR purchases, to make it easier for the community to purchase smaller amounts.\nRamp also has a large community of gamers thanks to its numerous partnerships with projects like Axie Infinity, DeFi Kingdoms, Pegaxy and more - those users already went through KYC with Ramp and they wouldn’t have to do it again when they’re getting started on Decentraland.\n\nHaving options\\\nGiving the community the option to choose between providers without having to leave the marketplace.\n\nNot having to rely on a single provider\\\nSo many things can go wrong, every provider has some downtime every now and then - don’t leave your users hangin’ when they’re about to buy that NFT. Have at least a backfall option.\n\nHappier users from 50+ more countries could get started more easily and at a lower cost, and spend more thanks to the additional on-ramp. Less downtime, delays and having the option to choose.\n\nThis would impact the whole community, especially those who are new to crypto and/or to $MANA and Polygon.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nCustom API keys for the integration will be provided by Ramp after the approval of this proposal. The DAO Committee should reach out to partner@ramp.network to receive them!\n\nSuggested placement of Ramp:\\\nUser’s account page > ‘BUY’ option next to $MATIC and $MANA balance, just like the current provider.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe simple API integration shouldn’t take longer than 20min - 2 hours. All technical details can be found in our docs at https://docs.ramp.network.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nQuick Due Diligence check and signing our general framework agreement will be required. After completing this step, member of Ramp's team will provide the custom API key.\n\nWe’re excited to support the community!\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a871df00-f216-11ec-aa01-87bd234b340d)**",

    "title": "Bring renewable electricity to Decentraland",
    "body": "> by 0x73c4914a6ec3e450a52b90bd7fe73929abc0241a (LTI)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nBECOMING THE FIRST DECENTRALAND NATIVE GREEN ENERGY SUPPLIER\nNRverse is aiming at decarbonizing the metaverse through linking it to renewables energy.\nFor this NRverse is leveraging trusted certificate called Renewables Energy Certificate (generated each time a renewables plan as a windmill or a solar panel is generating electricity) which are tokenized. Then the electricity consumed is evaluated in the different location. This energy calculation should include the end user device, the networking and the servers of the metaverse.\nOnce the energy is evaluated for each location (granularity of a country), a new NFT is created including the extract of all the related certificate based on the preferred energy type (e.g. wind, solar…).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n49,997 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x73c4914A6Ec3E450A52B90bd7fe73929ABC0241a\n\n## Description\n\nThe grant will be used for standardizing the current API of NRverse for Decentraland purpose. The ultimate goal would be to offer seamless \"Decentraland Green Option\" or DGO in Decentraland platform for running on green electricity any land, event or user experience. This will mean that each time the DGO is activated each related electricity consumption around the world will be backed by renewable energy.\nFor doing so we will need to adapt the modules of NRverse to Decentraland specific parameters, we talk about: the calculator and the tokenizer of Renewables Energy Certificate and finally the interface.\n\n1.  Calculator: First, and most important, is to develop the proper calculator modules adapted to Decentraland reality.\n    1.1) Evaluation of electricity consumption: The electricity consumption is coming from multiple source: the end user device, the networking, the server of Decentraland.\n    For each of these electricity consumption centers, 2 aspects must be evaluated: the location and the amount of electricity during a certain period. In that context the project will develop a specific calculator based on the data from each user (IP address, wallet information, browser...) but also based on Decentraland servers data.\n\n1.2) Listening to Decentraland through SDK: Then the calculator will need to interface with the current Decentraland SDK to evaluate specific land information (e.g. amount of users, wallet information, transaciton happening...)\n\n\\-> The result of this should evaluate in real time the worldwide consumption of electricity of the activity on the land (e.g. parcel 45,62 consuming during last hour 30kWh in Germany, 1300 MWh in US, 48 kWh in Brazil...).\n\n2.  Renewables Energy Certificate tokenizer: afterwards the amount of energy that is calculated needs to be extracted from existing Green certificate and tokenized into one NFT.\n    2.1) Tokenizer: We need to create the smart contract that will generate the NFT including all the extract from  the different guarantee of origin.\n    2.2) Update REC mother contract: We need to implement the logic that will update the smart contract that is containing the different original Renewables Energy Certificate (these are tokenized initially from a PDF coming from trusted issuers all over the world).\n\n3.  User Interface: Second the interface for proposing Decentraland decarbonization services will be built. It includes a portal for organizing event (for corporate for example), the renting of Land. This will include partnership with player like moonbash and MGHDAO.\n\nUltimately we should have on one side an API that could be offer to anybody that wants to integrate in its land automated decarbonization and on the other side a portal that can help any participant, land owner to initiate the decarbonization of a land (continuously) or a simple event. On top we could include this certification explicitly into some ticket that can take any form of collectible.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n1.  The first capability of the product has been developed (in beta): upload the pdf Renewables Energy Certificate and transform them into an NFT.\n    In that process, the PDF's (from the initial Renewable Energy Certificate - REC) are parsed and data are stored in IPFS, they are then signed via Verifiable Credential thanks to the wallet of the REC's supplier (here metamask). The interface is to upload the data is a simple webpage. The NFT is then generated and transferred tot he wallet of NRverse.\n    The current chain used is Ethereum testnet because VC's / DiD are not available on polygon yet but that could be derived easily based  open source code from EWF (https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ew-did-registry) which was used by the team in the past in other projects. There is a full documentation about the API and the process which could be put at disposal.\n\n2.  We need now to create the calculator capability for Decentraland and the related activities. This module will be most likely developed in javascript and will start by the evaluation of ethereum transaction notably based on McDonald calculation (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ethereum-emissions/blob/main/input/extra_data_label_regex.json ).\n    For the first version of the calculator the use in Decentraland will be based on benchmark as: laptop/desktop consumption, server consumption and networking from similar game and well as studies. Some details of technology architecture from Decentraland (servers, databases...) would help to evaluate more accurately the energy consumption.\n    For accurate calculation of an event or activity on a land the SDK of Decentraland will be used. Some advanced functionalities as conditional access to a parcel will also be used for specific event organisation for example. Another important interface will be the marketplace as certificate could be integrated as metadata of NFT to incentivize the explicit choice of participating to an event based on renewable energy.\n\n3.  The last capability to develop will be the tokenizer module that will aggregate the NFT containing all the extract of the Renewables Energy Certificates will be developed in Polygon.\n    The wallet to be used will as well be Metamask and the payment will be managed in Mana.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe project will be elad by Kai & Loic co-founder of NRverse and by their partners from BloxMove, MGH DAO and Lineup.\n\nKai Schmied is engineer with 10 years of experience in energy including 4 years fo experience in managing blockchain project in the context of the energy sector. He has for example implemented Decentralized Identifiers into Electrical Vehicle for seamless integration into the energy market. He's now NRverse co-founder.\n\nLoic has also a background in energy sector and 10 years of experience from trading, consulting,  and innovation in a major utility. He worked on blockchain project since 4 years and started with for example with the settlement of micro energy transaction. He's now NRverse co-founder\n\nHarry Behrens is CTO at mobility start-up bloxmove (token BLXM)  with deep experience f web3 (was in the past the head of the blockchain factory at Daimler). He's a reknown expert in the eco-system (especially in Germany) and has already focused on the development of the smart contract for the creation and the signature of the NFT of the mother Renewables energy certificate.\n\nPhil Thomsen is blockchain developer working for MGH DAO, startup focusing on metaverse project notably in Decentraland. Phil will contributes to smart contract creating new NFT from the energy consumption calculation.\n\nDmitriy Gatsura is experienced project manager and has deep experience in web2 and Web3, he will focus on the calculator module and its interaction with the smart contract.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe goal is to complete the overall project in the next 4 to 6 months. Current roadmap is based on an assumption of 18 weeks project:\n\nMilestone 1 (Week1-2):\n\n*   Finalize the calculator for Ethereum transaction\n*   Logic for energy consumption in Decentraland finalized (in kWh/user/h)\n\nMilestone 2 (Week3-5):\n\n*   First calculator module completed (excluding Decentraland SDK integration)\n\nMilestone 3 (Week 6):\n\n*   Documentation of calculator\n*   Finalize architecture of the tokenizer\n\nMilestone 4 (Week 6-7):\n\n*   Development of the tokenizer\n\nMilestone 5 (Week 8)\n\n*   Testnet value chain of calculator + tokenizer for specific case (e.g. 1h event hard coded data)\n\nMilestone 6 (Week 9-12)\n\n*   Connection to the NFT of the mother Renewable Certificate\n*   Implementation of Decentraland SDK input to take into account activity on specific parcel\n*   Metamask integration for transaction\n\nMilestone 7 (Week 13-14)\n\n*   Test end to end in a parcel (e.g. from MGHDAO) of generation of Renewables Energy Certificate NFT for activity on the land, first user feedback\n*   Design of the portal\n\nMilestone 8 (Week 15-17):\n\\-Portal development for interfacing with land owner, event organizer and Decentraland user\n\\-Implementation of interface with marketplace of Decentraland\n\nMilestone 9 (Week  18-20)\n\n*   Organization of test event and iteration on UX and bug fixing\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=693177c0-ef04-11ec-aa01-87bd234b340d)**",

DCL-Edit is the visual scene editor for the Decentraland SDK, developed by members of the MetaGameHub DAO (see https://dcl-edit.com).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2a9Da28bCbF97A8C008Fd211f5127b860613922D\n\n## Description\n\nOver the last months, we have been working on DCL-Edit, a visual editor that runs locally on your PC, allowing you to build and code your scene with the Decentraland SDK in parallel.\n\nGiving you the typical workflow of well known state-of-the-art game engines, the current stable base version already greatly boosts productivity.\n\nSince the release of the first stable version (check out our previous grant for the base version of DCL-Edit: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0cb35ba0-7e05-11ec-9447-6b730f00647d), we’ve added a couple of additional features like materials, improved UI and a prototype scene importer.\n\nThe journey has just begun, though. Although significantly boosting your productivity already, DCL-Edit still has so much potential. We’re about to get this tool to the next level. Based on the feedback from the developer community, we now put together a roadmap for the next six months to establish DCL-Edit as a professional, reliable and highly productive tool for Decentraland.\n\nTo reach our goal, a big refactoring for DCL-Edit is required. That means some significant chunks of the editor will be rewritten from the ground up, which will require some time. But fear not, we will keep updating the current version with bug fixes and smaller features as needed.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nDCL-Edit is developed in Unity and can be downloaded as a npm package.

    "body": "> by 0x29519122d08771ca4c83c8e3fa981df18721f76d (DCLRealEstate)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nHelp Decentraland’s biggest Realtor in the Rental Market.\n\nLet's keep making DCL being the best Metaverse in the world. We need to continue improving with onboarding new users, and making it easier for people to understand the platform. It needs to be easier to access land, create content and get solid advise in a secure way, on the same time giving value and income to DCL long term.\n\nHelp us, help growing the community! - We want to help onboard new users, advise them properly and make renting land easier.\n\nEvery land that gets rented, we’ll reward the community as thanks for trusting us = 5% on every sale in commission, which goes directly to the DAO committee wallet. It's managed by official DAO committee members Yemel & HPrivakos.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n22,500 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x29519122d08771Ca4c83C8E3Fa981Df18721f76D\n\n## Description\n\nWith the smart-contract rental model, we can lower the rental fee's to build and contribute, which will attract more users onboard and have fun in Decentraland.\n\nWHAT WE SOLVE OF PROBLEMS AND GAINS FOR DECENTRALAND\n\n*   Better user-experience for new users\n*   We onboard tons of new people, and answer their questions regarding the best Metaverse Decentraland\n*   We help generate income and new business to Decentraland\n*   We help land gets REAL content. We connect P2E games, NFT galleries, Meta Breweries and much more to land-owners\n*   We need it to be EASY to be a consumer and content creator in Decentraland.\n*   Prevent scamming and advising users properly\n\nWe're ready to do our part to IMPROVE Decentraland, and bring growth and income to the Decentraland foundation, on the same time we bring value to the platform, so we can continue being the best metaverse in the world.\n\nOn a short notice:\n\n*   We want to create the best Rental Experience in Decentraland, where land-owners easily can become \"landlords\". Way too much land are empty. We need content, exciting areas and places to visit to make sure we continue grow our platform. We are solving this with our Realtor Rental Platform. We need a smart-contract to ensure the transperency, security and easy-ness to make sure Decentraland Rentals are accessable to all.\n\nAnd YES, we know there are platforms like Double and LandWorks - but they are not the biggest, most active and have the same level of live-chat-support (and even video-calls) like DCL Real Estate does. This is why DCL Real Estate is now requesting a grant from the great and amazing community and DAO in Decentraland. Help us govern the Rentals in Decentraland.\nWe will provide a technical great solution, which is already in the making. It will be easy to get answers from resources from our Decentraland Experts.. Most users leave the DCL community because they don't understand how our world works - this is why Agents and Trusted Advisors are important.\n\nThis is why we propose, the DAO help us funding our DCL REAL ESTATE RENTAL PLATFORM v2. We're the biggest and best Realtor in Decentraland with most results, and we ask you to help us.\n\nWith this grant, we will be able to create the best rental-platform, that Decentraland has seen. Even more it will have features such as LIVE SUPPORT, Land advise, Scene catalog, Free Scenes to publish, Verified scene makers with live support and best of all - as thanks for the grant we will give back Decentraland and the DAO - 5% in commission on EVERY sale/rental we get on the platform.\n\nDCL Real Estate is a project to contribute to Decentraland. Our job is to get users to interact with the platform in Decentraland, which means use the land as content creation, get buyers and tenants to meet the landlords and sellers, and create a better Decentraland.\n\nA short introduction about us - DCL Real Estate is the biggest and one of the first realtors in Decentraland. We provide services such as “Selling”, “buying”, “Leasing land”, and “renting land” services.\n\nWe’re onboarding new users to Decentraland every day, and we keep on being one of the first encounters on many occasions when people explore how they can get started building and further grow Decentraland, with lands and content. With granting us the funds we will be able to grow the land- and rental market within Decentraland, and on the same time making DCL Real Estate decentralized through giving DAO shares, on 5% on every sale.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nBlockchain: Ethereum\n\nTools:\n\n*   vscode, hardhat, metamask for smart contract\n*   React, redux, tailwind for website\n*   React, redux, react native for app\n\nIssue: the community is riddled with scammers within a peer to peer transactional space. This results in lower trust in Decentraland, and therefore less community usage and interaction. It also empowers easy access to rent, with possibility to access a Trusted Advisor who knows the DCL space, and on the same time access utilities such as a free scene - and income to the DAO which means the people of Decentraland.\n\nSolution: this rental smart contract will provide additional comfort for land owners and prospective buyers/renters, as they will no longer have to worry about being scammed. We will become an added small business within decentraland, bring additional volume, and showing evidence of successful business operations within a leading metaverse platform.\n\nUsers can easily:\n\n1.  Tenants can easily rent lands easy on the site\n2.  Landlords can list their lands easy on the site.\n    \\---> Free Scene access\n    \\---> Premium Scenes access\n    \\---> Live Support from DCL Experts (Building experts, Land experts, General support)\n    \\---> Help to increase security and prevent scam\n    \\---> 5% commission to DAO/DCL on each sale/rental.\n\nTHE PROCESS TO RENT (As a Tenant)\n\n1.  User connect wallet\n2.  User find the wanted land, and press \"rent land\" and pay's (For example 1-12 months)\n3.  Landlord automaticly get's operator assigned to tenant's address or manually add another operator\n4.  Money gets in Escrow wallet\n5.  Money gets released after 30 days to landlord (+ DAO fee and Platform fee's withdrawn)\n6.  Tenant will automatic pay every 30 days, and the lease will end if payment has failed, and other tenants will be able to access and rent the landlords' land.\n\nTHE PROCESS TO LEASE (As a Land-owner/Landlord)\n\n1.  User connect wallet\n2.  User press \"List land\" choose how much they want to earn, rental period etc.\n3.  Landlord signs smart-contract.\n\nIMPORTANT TO NOTICE:\nA landowner can ALWAYS remove operator or sell a land. It is not possible to make sure they can't, so this is a fully secure rental-system which will provide security for the tenant's funds, and landlord's land asset. This is why this project DO NOT transfer any land-nft-asset but simply acts as a money-middleman, and takes a fee for doing it automatic, easy and cheap. If a landlord/landowner proceed to remove operator/sell the land after renting it out, the tenant will be refunded, and the land-owners' address will be noticed as a \"Bad Landlord\".\n\nDAO will get income from the sales and rentals, aswell as the landlord and realtor platform fee's.\n\nPayments and commissions to DAO will be sent to:\n\n*   Either DAO directly: https://etherscan.io/address/0x9a6ebe7e2a7722f8200d0ffb63a1f6406a0d7dce\n\n*   Or Multisig owned by the DAO Committee (Yemel and HPrivakos): https://etherscan.io/address/0x89214c8Ca9A49E60a3bfa8e00544F384C93719b1\n\nWe will make the smart-contract and address changeable, because DAO is still new and it's growing fast so we might need to change in the future, after advise from DAO committee members.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nTHE TEAM:\nLead Developer & Blockchain Developer:\n\n*   Aaron Porchia (https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-porchia-054a96239/)\n\nWeb3 Development Manager:\n\n*   Travis Holm (T-rav#0132 on discord)\n\nCo-Founder & CEO of DCL Real Estate:\n\n*   Emil Klockmann (Klockmann#3349 on discord)\n\nRental Agent, Co-Founder & DCL Expert:\n\n*   Christoffer Laursen (Laursen#4812 on discord)\n\n***\n\nDEV-TEAM RESULTS AND BACKGROUN:\nETH projects:\n\n*   Oxygen token\n*   Strip token\n*   leaf token\n*   ball token\n*   DefiPlaza token\n\nMessaging app on ETH:\n\n*   https://www.epigeon.org/\n\nNFT Marketplaces:\n\n*   https://portion.io/\n*   https://www.nftation.io/\n\nNFT Collections:\n\n*   https://themetakey.com/\n*   https://mooncat.community/\n*   https://nbayc.co/\n\nExchanges:\n\n*   https://defiplaza.net/\n*   Binance\n\nPET NFT and staking rewards:\nhttps://pets.micropets.io/\n\nSocial media platform in solana:\nhttps://satellite.one/\n\nTrading platform:\n\n*   https://www.orca.so/\n\n***\n\nSite:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EojSz4K.png\n\nBudget:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GzgrLzZ.png)\n\nLinks:\n\n*   Website: https://dclrealestate.org/\n*   Email: dclrealestateagency@gmail.com\n*   Discord server: https://discord.gg/XBjCRTbRZP\n*   Office in DCL: https://dclrealestate.dcl.eth/\n*   Twitter: https://twitter.com/DCL_RealEstate\n*   Article about us: https://medium.com/@hugh.blaxland/newcomers-dcl-real-estate-driving-development-in-decentraland-1da112c1d210\n\nFor any further questions we are ready to answer any questions you might have.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cGW4CNe.png)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis project will be completed within 6 weeks-6months.

UI and UX designing, Smart Contract Development & Website app creation\n\n*   Month 4: Code Audition\n\n*   Month 5: Internal Testing, Debug and Code Polish. Also development of resources, tips, tricks, videos and onboarding to platform and DCL.\n\n*   Month 6: Official launch and income generating\n\nWe strive to make the project release before it's due. But it's important EVERYTHING is perfect, and make sure the quality of the project.\n\nTo keep track of all of the related update, we'll release reports and share them on our Discord & in the DAO grant community on their discord: https://discord.gg/XBjCRTbRZP - but we will also be ready to answer questions on the forum and on email.\n\nThe DCL Real Estate already implemented rentals and sold results for more than 27+ clients and  smart contracts will make rewards and security better and easier combined with advisory to new users of DCL to make Decentraland the best Metaverse, so it makes sense for DAO to do this execution. The funds will go entirely to the community through commission on rentals.\n\nWe're ready for the future of Real Estate and the rental market in Decentraland. Help us, by helping Decentraland building it. Are you ready for it?\n\nThank you for reading✅.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=74473440-ee84-11ec-aa01-87bd234b340d)**",

Every other platform allows for the mint number to be inserted at X amount.\n\nDecentraland current mint amount options.\n1\n10\n100\n1,000\n5,000\n10,000\n100,000\n\nA new contract that allows for publishers to choose any number of mint options. This is more of a personal reason as a creator. Those mint options do not make sense most of the time with publishments.\n\nI rarely can make sense of an NFT in Decentraland with a 100 mints, 1000 mints, or 5,000 mints. The numbers are way too broad.\n\nThe current alternative options are\n\n1.  To create and burn them. Which makes the color system irrelevant anyway. (Many creators have already done this.)\n\n2.  Create your own contract and go through the Linked wearables registry. (Honestly just a laughable attempt option.)\n\n- Allow specific mint amounts\n- We don't need specific mint amounts.\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f78ecc00-ee39-11ec-aa01-87bd234b340d)**",

    "body": "> by 0x11cbb078596e5100f4cbb999c5c9b69ca2ff6477 (Bronstein)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nA financial model is the foundation for which TradFi companies make decisions around revenue,  expenses, partnerships, M\\&A, etc. We believe that Decentraland would benefit greatly from having a financial model that they could reference when making  operating decisions. The financial model would include historical financial statements, a monthly budget for 2022, and a detailed forecast out through 2025.\n\nAs a first step, we would propose preparing financial statements for January – May of 2022, and a strawman for what a 2022 budget and long-range forecast would be. We would share our report with the community, and to the extent they were interested, we would propose a new grant to develop a fully-detailed and dynamic financial model.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n20,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x11cbB078596E5100F4cbB999c5C9b69cA2FF6477\n\n## Description\n\nAs DAOs mature, we expect to see more sophisticated financial frameworks emerge in the operations of DAOs.\n\nThe three pieces of this are historical financial statements, a near-term budget, and a long-term forecast. These are three things that TradFi companies have entire teams dedicated to building and maintaining. They form the basis for key operating decisions that companies make around revenue, expenses, cash management, etc. and also serve as a helpful launch point when making key strategic decisions around partnerships, fundraising, and M\\&A.\n\nMakerDAO is a DAO that has detailed financial reporting in place and they use it inform a variety of these operating decisions: https://drive.google.com/file/u/1/d/14U-3xlXC59zmFCd2u42CAFc7uw-NSKaJ/view\n\nPutting together these three things is a material undertaking, so we would propose as a starting point to put together monthly financial statements for January - May of 2022, and a strawman of a short-term budget and a long-term financial forecast. Upon completing that, we would share our report with the DAOs, and would then propose a subsequent grant to build out all years of historical financial statements, in addition to a detailed budget and long-range forecast.\n\nThe financial statements and forecast would sit in google sheets, but ultimately we would drive towards having a presentation with visuals so that the community would be able to get monthly / quarterly reports on financial performance and the implications on the long-term financial forecast for Decentraland.\n\nCurrently, Jordan and I are charging $500 / hour to do similar FP\\&A work for web2 companies. Even the initial step of this exercise is a material undertaking, and for $20k,  our hourly rate will come out out well below that. We are proposing this initial step because we believe strongly that once the community sees an initial output, they will see the value in what we are doing and be supportive of further grant work for Jordan and I to continue supporting the Decentraland community.\n\nUltimately, we want to drive towards having a sophisticated FP\\&A function for Decentraland, and this grant is the first step we would take towards getting there.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe initial report would be presented in google slides, with the underlying analysis being done in google sheets. The main tools we would leverage to retrieve data would be Etherscan, Apeboard, and Dune.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nSam Bronstein: 7 years of investment banking experience at Qatalyst. Worked on $125Bn+ of M\\&A transactions including the sales of Slack, LinkedIn, Qualtrics, Glassdor, and others.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-bronstein-683b1350/\n\nJordan Stasnty: 7 years of investment banking experience at Qatalyst and Citi. Worked on $35Bn+ of M\\&A transactions including the sales of Mailchimp, Five9, Salesloft, and others. Also worked on the IPO of Roku at Citi.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-stastny-78160461/\n\nAll of the above transactions included material amounts of financial modeling and analysis during the valuation and diligence process.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe would propose sharing our 2022 historical financials and strawman for the budget and forecast no later than 4 weeks after being approved for the grant, with the aim of finishing sooner\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a31bfa40-ed02-11ec-aa01-87bd234b340d)**",

    "body": "> by 0x1ef67867464a400cf6d821807d2b68a6f65dfe4d\n\nShould the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis project is to create a mascot that can represent the common identity and spiritual core of the DCL. We believe that a high-quality mascot can play a significant role in the development of the DCL community as it will not only be a unique IP for Decentraland but also make Decentraland the first of the four major metaverse platforms to have its own symbol.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x8c127AB5762CB50C993a198b6187c0833746e404\n\n## Description\n\nBEAM studio is a globally-based studio. We are committed to exploring brand-new ways digital natives interact with information, space, and each other, as our name suggests, Build Exciting Adventures in Metaverse. Meanwhile, we aim to bring together global creators to create various experiences to promote the process of metaverse construction and build virtual worlds beyond imagination.​\n​\n\nWe propose creating a mascot that can represent the common identity and spiritual core of the DCL, which will help the DCL community to stand out on the metaverse platforms since this creation will be the first significant symbolic representation within the four major metaverse platforms. We believe that Web3.0 will enable the mascot to work even more functionally. The reasons are as follows.​\n​\n\nFirst and foremost, a DCL Mascot is a powerful marketing tool as it makes it easier for DCL to create a physical and emotional connection with every member. We think that because Web3.0 community members are from all over the world and in most cases, they don't have the opportunity to meet each other face to face, it has become harder for them to generate a sense of belonging. However, with the help of a mascot and more varied promo campaigns, DCL can easily bring the whole community together. For example, mascot costumes can be designed for members to wear in metaverse events, which will go a long way to making DCL members stand out and feel proud of their identities.​\n​\n\nWhat's more, the mascot will give DCL a competitive advantage on social media as followers are more likely to engage with the digital mascot. From Twitter pages to DCL experiences, a mascot can appear on various platforms. Mascot memes can also be created for DCL members to use on every platform.​\n​\n\nLast but not least, the DCL Mascot will be a memorable IP.​\n​\n\nThe BEAM Studio Team and any additional designers will work closely together to develop a first-of-its-kind Mascot with a unique personality, interactivity, and emotional support.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo begin this project, we will create a survey to collect DCL community members' opinions about the mascot and analyze the common traits within the community to decide on a mascot form that will perfectly represent the spiritual core of the community. This grant is not just a means of ensuring the whole project can kick-off, but also an opportunity for the community to highlight what they stand for.​\n​\n\nOne key part of this project is to design the virtual character of the mascot. We will use AI, C4D, AE, and other design tools to produce digital work. If it's a human or animal mascot, we will design its facial expressions, clothing, colour schemes, etc. If it's an object mascot, we will focus on how to convey the community spirits through this item with a combination of visuals and metaphors.​\n​\n\nBefore finalizing the design for the mascot, we will make sure that it goes well with all of these platform assets like logos, default fonts, and colour schemes. We plan to design mascot-related memes and motions in the future and plan to release these memes and motions on our discord server. The avatars of the community administrators will all be replaced by mascots, and information about the mascot will be posted in the server's announcement. We promise that we will promote Mascot not only on our Discord server but also on our other official social media accounts, such as WeChat, Twitter, etc. Through our vigorous promotion, people will greatly increase their awareness of the mascot, and the image of DCL's mascot will be deeply rooted in their hearts. When people see the mascot, they will think that it represents DCL.​\n​\n\nFinally, the launch of the DCL Mascot could be coupled with a marketing project, as we want to ensure we bring as many eyes to Decentraland as possible with this mascot. This will bring the potential impact of DCL on the metaverse, with the aim of further encouraging the adoption of Decentraland, highlighting how it brings the community together and enables DCL users to fund projects that they have faith in.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe proposed team of the Decentraland Mascot is the following:​\n\nMori:​\nCrypto artist, senior visual designer & freelance illustrator. Rich experiences in co-branding projects in multinational companies. Extremely passionate about the crypto world and pioneer in NFT creation.​\nProject Experiences: Coca-Cola summer full line packaging Invited Designer; CONVERSE Chrunk Taylor All star 1970s Artist Collaboration Invited Artist; Kidrobot Global Artist Collaboration Invited Artist; Uniqlo x Designer Limited Edition; Kappa x Designer Limited Edition.​\n\nGrant:​\nSenior industrial & CMF designer with expertise in intelligent mobility and digital communication industry; rich cross-cultural studying and working experiences to combine the viewpoints of different disciplines and industries.​\nProject experiences: Geely Geometry+, Geometry A car design, future conceptual vehicle design of Renault, OPPO flagship model design, Huawei P10 design; Minecraft architecture enthuasit; MA in Industry Design, University of the Arts London.​\n\nMori and Grant are core designers of BEAM Studio.\nTheir portfolio link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o9eanXWCYoMHEk8O1L1kaQ9VF5kl9bw8/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis project will take 6 weeks to develop and can be broken down into weekly deliverables:​\n\nWeek 1: Conceptualization: Create a survey to analyze the DCL common identity, and determine the mascot form depending on members' preference; Start designing the mascot form;​\n\nWeek 2: Create features such as facial expressions and clothing of the mascot which can develop alive character;​\n\nWeek 3: Personalization: Establish a connection by aligning the mascot with DCL;​\n\nWeek 4: Motion: Design three standard motions for the mascot;​\n\nWeek 5: Align the Mascot with DCL visual identity; Before finalizing the design for the mascot, we will make sure that it goes well with all of these platform assets like logos, default fonts, and color schemes;​\n\nWeek 6: Launch the DCL Mascot to the community.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=61214010-ec84-11ec-aa01-87bd234b340d)**",

The plan includes partnering with [ICFJ](https://www.icfj.org/) (International Center for Journalism), hosting talks, and organizing a web3 journalism hackathon with prizes for winners. **We would like to invite as speakers and mentors, members from the Decentraland community to talk about the possibilities the metaverse and DAOs as organizational structures could provide to journalists and independent media.**\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n20,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x0b30f5f1A39C4899f312c9466c516EAC43d71A42\n\n## Description\n\nA two-day hackathon hosted and sponsored by ICFJ and the Decentraland DAO at [Hacks/Hackers’](https://www.hackshackers.com/) Media Party in Buenos Aires 2022. The activity will be focused on the possibilities that the Web3 ecosystem (Tools, communities, funding, and incentives) could provide to journalists and independent media projects. Some topics we are planning to address:\n\n*   Metaverse journalism\n*   Media DAOs\n*   Decentralized tools for journalists\n*   Token Funding\n*   Token-gated content\n*   Token incentives for collaborators\n\nThe plan is to invite 5 speakers that will also serve as mentors on the Hackathon, that could talk about all these topics. Potential candidates are:\n\n*   Laurent Bainier - [20mint.fr](https://20mint.xyz/) Web3 project from the french magazine 20minutes\n*   KevinOnEarth - [Decentraland Report](https://xpand.gg/community/the-decentraland-report)\n*   Reporters without borders - [Uncensored Library Project](https://www.uncensoredlibrary.com/en) ([Grant funded](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=efddde80-bf1b-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4) by Decentraland DAO)\n*   [Tinshui Yeung](https://www.icfj.org/about/profiles/tinshui-yeung) - ICFJ Fellow researching web3 journalism\n*   Know someone who is doing cool stuff around web3, metaverses, and journalism? Let us know in the comments!\n\n### Why this event?\n\nHosting a hackathon in the context of the Media Party is natural since Buenos Aires is going through a Crypto Revolution, has a strong community, and is becoming one of the leading crypto capitals in the world. Projects like Proof of Humanity, Kleros, POAP, Decentraland, OpenZeppelin, HardHat, and Muun all have roots in Buenos Aires. Furthermore, Media Party has been the most innovative forum for journalism and technology discussions in LATAM for the last 10 years. Like the web3 movement, Media Party is a community-first event, focused and organized by independent members, and is also a hands-on conference where people come to learn by doing and interacting with others.\n\nSome of the previous and current sponsors of the Media Party have been: Mozilla Foundation, Meta, Google, ICFJ, Open Knowledge Foundation, and Omidyar Network. We believe that listing Decentraland as a sponsor of the event could raise awareness about the project to an audience (Journalists and media people) who talk about the metaverse but never really experienced it.\n\n### Why the Decentraland DAO?\n\nLet's face it, journalists talk a lot about the Metaverse but most of them never experienced it. We would like to put this project right in front of them, with all the complexities and potential that an open-source, community ran project have. It is also interesting since Meta is going to be sponsoring the event and they have a lot of journalist-related projects. We want to show that there is another way of thinking about the internet and how the information flows. And lastly, we believe it would be a nice place to showcase the Community Grants program to content creators and media outlets from all over the world.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe total cost of this event, including travel expenses (Flights & hotel), production costs, GMF (Goodies, merch, and food), and hackathon winner prizes is estimated at $40k. **Since we would be partnering with ICFJ, they will provide $20k and the Decentraland community would provide the other $20k**\n\nBudget breakdown\n\n![budget-breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/bmPZjUm.png)\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n[Gino Cingolani](https://twitter.com/ginocingolani) (Decentraland DAO / Media Party)\nDecentraland Governance Squad Product Lead, Media Party Line-up Programmer.\n\n[Maggie Farley](https://twitter.com/maggilista) (ICFJ)\\\nICFJ Director of Knight Fellowships.

Most individuals are unable to travel owing to a lack of funds and time, but with the assistance of the metaverse, consumers may experience travel, nature, and nearly anything that we would encounter in real life. Office meeting places, similar to Zoom and Google Meet, but in a virtual world using holograms. I work with a team of full stack developers that have over 5 years of expertise creating NFT markets and AR. We are non-profit researchers who wish to contribute to Metaverse by making our technology open source so that anybody may learn, create, and contribute.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x674FBA52201254b3c123aAABa96c5e36C208CEB7\n\n## Description\n\nAs a blockchain startup and metaverse enthusiasts we seek to help younger and upcoming generation to learn and build there skills with blockchain developer. Most of the people are not able to travel due to lack of wealth and time but with the help of metaverse customers can experience travel, Nature and almost everything that we would experience in real time can be experienced and the beauty is that even differently able people could experience the travel. NFT's and other metaverse wearable goods can be bought inside the market place and we can implement amazon like shops like super market where every product can be seen, viewed and reviewed. We can directly order inside the metaverse and can get products in door steps in reality.Virtual weddings are currently going on trend as guest and everything from food to rent place is reduced and is cost effective yet wonderful experience. As education and competitions gets harder and harder student lack in the skills and practical knowledge with help of VR education students can learn parts of machinery and also helps for doctors to learn about human anatomy. Movie theatrical experience in the comfort of home within a VR space and can spend time with loved once and get experience of Real-time theatre experience. We also create an metaverse casino space as a P2E gaming. Companies in the entertainment industry are capitalising on the notion of metaverse hospitality by producing realistic experiences that clients can enjoy from the comfort of their own homes, largely via the use of virtual reality technology and VR headsets. In reality, this is an exceptionally cost-effective approach. Roller-coasters, are expensive to build in real life, and there are severe safety regulations. However, with a virtual reality experience, genuine roller coasters may be enjoyed in a virtual environment without the prices or risks. Of course, virtual reality experiences can violate natural rules, and some of the other possibilities include virtual experiences such as walking on the moon or Mars, or visiting virtual tourist spots.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWith the help of Unity 3D, Java.AR and 3D modellings with blender and publish directly with decentraland as sublayers and transactions will be processed with decentraland.\nWith solidity and blockchain as back end we run all the process and run them under smart-contracts.\nOur plan is to have a space where other projects and brands can relate and join, which will bring more users. Creating more customers for decentraland with game features will bring more value to Decentraland. There are many people interested in travelling and we believe this project can expand quickly.\n\nOnce we have the HQ running we can generate income by:\n\nRenting space for offices and other merch,\nCustom events for clients(marriages etc)\nCreating learning courses inside decentraland\nSelling courses as NFTs\nThe funds from DAO would allow us to create improved and sustainble experiences that we can later present to users, clients and collaborators. We plan to work with iconic creators, invest on promoting and bringing more people in, by building a platform with a fun game-play and dynamic supportive enviroment.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nClar was an aspiration to group of experienced professionals seeking a breakthrough, in providing innovative & disruptive Blockchain based solutions to their customers.

    "body": "> by 0x6a77883ed4e65a1df591fda2f5252fd7c548f198 (Fancy)\n\nRecently an invitation was extended by co-founder of Umbria Oscar Chambers to discuss adding $MANA to their platform.  Would you support this conversation taking place?\nPlease feel free to check out their discord's #community-support channel to verify this offer.  Search for Fancy#1446's communication brief thread starting on June 10th at 9:41 am CST.\n\nI'm posting this proposal because historically the foundation has been difficult to reach, and I believe if added, the community would collectively save tens of thousands of dollars if not MUCH more over time. Currently if you hold $MANA on the ethereum chain, you must first swap it to another currency to bridge on the Umbria platform.\n\nThe Umbria Narni Bridge uses a novel liquidity-provision protocol, to speed up, and lower the cost of cross-chain bridging. The bridge facilitates cross-chain migration of assets by holding multiple assets on multiple chains, simultaneously, in liquidity pools.\n\nThe Umbria Narni bridge is different to other cross-chain bridges, because it does not rely on validator smart contracts, which can dramatically slow the bridging process. By removing the necessity for such validation, the Umbria Narni bridge can complete cross-chain transactions with an order of magnitude cheaper fees.\n\nwebsite: http://bridge.umbria.network\nUmbria offers bridging at a rate that is as much as 10x Cheaper and 10x Faster than other bridging platforms.  Transactions typically occur in under 4 minutes at a cost of between $4-$9 USD.\n\nCurrent supported assets from Umbria include: Ethereum, Wrapped Bitcoin, USD Coin,\nTether USD, Polygon, Ghost Token, Umbria Token\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/765134619120762901/944707809424064513/984829662876303401 - Posting this link for easy access to the communication thread.

    "title": "Restructuring Wearables Submission Fees",
    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Restructuring Wearables Submission Fees](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=128084f0-e1dc-11ec-bdb6-655e1f599935)\n\n## Summary\n\nSet the wearable submission to $150 USD worth of MANA and set the curators compensation to $50 USD per item reviewed.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to align the DCL community about how the wearable submission fee should be structured. The proposal gives more context about the history, motivations and economics of the fee and also proposes a new scheme.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Wearables Marketplace was originally launched on  [June 1st 2021](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor/) , with the goal of empowering a creators economy by giving users a wide variety of choices to express themselves and giving creators the tools to monetize their work.\n\nEvery creator that submits a new wearable to the marketplace is asked to pay a fee in MANA (Wearable Submission Fee). This fee is necessary to:\n\n*   Cover the compensation of the curator that will review the submission to ensure technical soundness and protect against IP infringements.\n\n*   Limit the cost of *perpetually* hosting the wearable in the Catalyst Decentralized Network.\n\n*   Foster the continual growth of Decentraland platform and its community via giving those fees to the DAO and funding the Community Grants program.\n\nThe wearable submission fee was originally set to 500 MANA, with a MANA price of ~0.8 USD. However when the MANA price reached the $2 USD mark the community raised their concerns via  [a proposal to automatically adjust the fee to a fixed amount of 500 USD payable in MANA was voted.](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)\n\nThe proposal noted that pegging the publication fee to USD was healthy for the creators’ economy. It allows the creators to better budget their projects and market their services without exposing them to the fluctuation of the MANA price.\n\nThe proposal was raised to the Security Advisory Board and decided to lower the wearable submission fee one-time to 100 MANA as a temporary measure in the waiting for an automated solution. This change was announced in the  [DAO Committee Report #12](https://decentraland.org/blog/project-updates/dao-committee-report-12/) .\n\nSince then, the price of MANA has come down to the $1 USD mark and the current fee seems too low. The curator committee is getting 10 MANA per item review and it doesn’t seem up to the responsibility of the role. At the same time, going back to a 500 USD fee is shocking for new creators in the Decetraland community.\n\nThis proposal aims to restructure the current wearable submission fee to a more sustainable framework. The goal is to keep the fee at minimum while still covering the expenses for the marketplace to work.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nBelow is the specification of how the Wearable Submission Fee should be structured:\n\n*   The fee amount should be set at a fixed USD price, but paid in MANA.\n\n*   The fee should cover the work of a curator to review the submission.\n\n*   The fee should support the catalyst network.\n\n*   The fee should support the DAO to continue investing in Grants.\n\nThe first item has been addressed by the Decentraland Foundation team by creating a new version of the marketplace smart contracts that uses a Chainlink oracle to get the current MANA price. This way the fee is paid in MANA but the amount is set in USD.\n\nRegarding the compensation of the curator for each review, a price of **$50 USD per item reviewed** seems fair. The curation might take between 30 minutes and several hours depending on the feedback cycles with creators.\n\nThe catalyst network is currently formed by 11 servers that hosts all the content of Decentraland’s world, including wearable 3d models, scene content and avatar selections. Half of the Catalyst servers are runned by Decentraland Foundation and the rest by individual community members.\n\nThe cost of hosting a Catalyst server is ~600 USD per month. The total annual cost to run the 11 servers is ~$80,000 USD. At this moment this cost is paid by catalyst owners and is not subsidized by the DAO, but it totally should, **and part of the Wearable Submission Fee should be allocated to subsidize catalyst owners.**\n\nIn the past year 5,530 wearables have been submitted to the marketplace, so if we maintain this publication rate, **a fee of 15 USD per wearable** should be enough to account for catalyst expenses for a year.\n\nAnd finally, the DAO should get a fee to continue investing in the Grants Program, fostering the development and growth of the platform. **A contribution between 50 and 100 USD should be allocated for this purpose.**\n\n**Wearable Submission Fee = 150 USD**\n\n*   33% = 50 USD go to the curator\n*   10% = 15 USD to supporting catalyst servers\n*   57% = 85 USD goig to the DAO to support the Grant’s Program.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThis proposal will be beneficial to creators by derisking how they budget projects and promote their services, removing the volatility of MANA from the equation.\n\nThe proposed value of $150 USD per submitted wearable should be attractive to many talented creators while still preventing spam and supporting the underlying cost of running a wearables marketplace.\n\nA potential risk is to incentivize the submissions of low-quality wearables, making the curation process longer and rising the cost of running a catalyst. This could be mitigated by implementing more automation over the process curation process and/or raising the price in the future with a new governance process.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nDecentraland Foundation with the help of the Security Advisory Board will deploy the update of the marketplace's smart contracts to set the wearable submission to $150 USD payable in MANA.\n\nThe DAO Committee will issue payments to curators on monthly basis at a new rate of $50 USD per curation. The DAO Committee will propose a mechanism to distribute compensation to catalyst owners over time.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal aims to set the wearable submission fee to a USD value in order to better support the creators economy, derisking them from market volatility, enabling to budget projects and market their services at a expectable rate.\n\nEconomics considerations have been made to ensure that a fee of 150 USD can cover the compensation of the curators, a subsidy to the catalyst network and keep reinvesting in the growth of the platform.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b8075360-e8e7-11ec-82d9-d917cdd158ac)**",

    "body": "> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nCreate a governance facilitation unit to support operation of the Decentraland DAO.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n75,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x0D109CD701946D4cFE1a687b80b59Ca80732fAC5\n\n## Description\n\nThis proposal is to establish a **DAO Facilitation Squad** to expand on the role previously served by an individual DAO Facilitator. The role of the DAO facilitation team will be to help identity and express community stakeholder interests in well thought out and implementable governance proposals, build consensus and facilitate working groups to resolve issues of importance in the Decentraland ecosystem, host monthly town hall meetings and maintain a persistent presence in the DAO Discord server, drive the DAOs externally facing strategic communications, and help mediate relations between the DAO Community, DAO Committee and Decentraland Foundation.\n\nEstablishment of the DAO Facilitation Squad is part of a broader process to organize DAO operations around “Core Units,” which additionally include the **DAO Governance Squad** and the **Grants Support Team**. Each of these Core Units will serve six month terms, and be funded through the DAO’s standard grantmaking process.\n\nDespite its name, the operation of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is in large part a human process. While some view decentralization and automation through maximalist lenses, as the Decentraland DAO facilitator and an academic political theorist, I believe decentralization is as much an ethos as it is a system, and automation is about augmenting human processes to decrease friction and increase governing efficiency. As a result, engaged facilitation is an essential part of decentralized governance, particularly in virtual distributed systems such as Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis grant will set up a budget to run the DAO Facilitation Team for a period of 6 months. The proposed team will be managed by the current DAO Facilitator, Matimio, and the grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stablecoins distributed to a wallet used solely for the purposes of receiving and distributing grant funds to team members.\n\nThe Governance Facilitation Squad will focus on two primary functions: **Operations** and **Research & Analytics**.\n\n*   The Operations Team will be responsible for strategic communications, marketing, and DAO Discord server moderation and engagement. [( Link )](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOeomRcA=/?share_link_id=184697690463)\n*   The Analytics & Research Team will be responsible for proposal writing, working group facilitation, proposal impact assessment and implementation research and DAO Discord server moderation and engagement. [( Link )](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOvsEcOM=/?share_link_id=435185352063)\n\nGovernance Facilitators will provide the opportunity for a working group to be created in the DAO Discord server following passage of an initial governance poll. They will engage with interested stakeholders until the issue is promoted through the governance stages, or fails to pass to the subsequent stage.\n\nThe Governance Squad [( Link )](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=524fb800-d532-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0), Grants Support Squad [( Link )](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7a236540-d305-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0), and Governance Facilitation Squad will make up three **Core Units** of the DAO, which will coordinate to maintain effective and efficient operations, and represent Decentraland Community interests.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe proposed team of the Governance Facilitation Squad is as follows:\n\n*   Governance Facilitation Manager – Matimio, aka Markman [(  Linkedin )](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathewmark/): Matimio is a socio-technical engineer and the current DAO Facilitator. He is currently finishing his PhD in Future Studies and Political Science.\n*   Governance Facilitation Operations – Fractilians, aka Natalie [(  Linkedin )](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathalie-nunez-38143418/): Fractilian is an experienced media and content creator, and currently serves as a reporter for the DCL Report [(  Twitch )](https://www.twitch.tv/fractilians). Previously, Fractillians worked with Rariable Protocol DAO.\n*   Governance Facilitation Research – Tyler, aka JETTY [(  Linkedin )](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-banyay-7754a9207/): Tyler is an experienced community manager and former team member of Nike Special Projects. He is currently a Co-Founder of the research and strategy partnership M-RG.\n\nTotal Hours:  ~160 monthly hours or ~40 weekly hours.\nBudget: $12,000 USD per month or $3,000 USD per week for a grand total of $72,000 USD.\n\n*   Manager: ~10 hours\n*   Operations ~15 hours\n*   Research & Analytics ~15\n\nTotal budget includes:\n\n*   Team Compensation: $72,000 USD\n*   Operational Expenses: $3,000 USD\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nAll Governance Facilitation team members will be responsible for the following items:\n\n*   Attending weekly Facilitation Squad team meetings\n*   Attending bi-weekly Core Unit meetings\n*   Hosting monthly DAO Town Halls.\n*   Maintaining regular presence and facilitating engagement in the DAO Discord server\n\nThe **Governance Facilitation Operations** team members will be responsible for the following items:\n\n*   Defining and administering Decentraland DAO’s social media strategy\n*   Supporting ongoing publication of the weekly DAO newsletter with the Governance Squad\n*   Producing content to increase DAO participation\n*   Organizing in-world meet-ups\n\nThe **Governance Facilitation Research & Analytics** team members will be responsible for the following items:\n\n*   Facilitating issue-specific working groups\n*   Researching proposal impact and implementation pathways\n*   Mediating between conflicting interest groups and stakeholders\n*   Publication of bi-weekly governance update\n*   Supporting effective and stable governance\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f8b699c0-e810-11ec-82d9-d917cdd158ac)**",

We have already made four editions of our Metaverse Fashion Week Tour series, tours to TX Huaihai, The University of Hong Kong Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, and the Cannes Film Festival, which have been shown in three editions. Altogether, a cumulative total of 2,000 followers and a total viewership of over 10k.\n\nThe problem we found is that sometimes it can be hard for us to visit all the scenes and make videos, for instance, during the MVFW. Our next step is to show more spaces and events in Decentraland to bring more awareness to the whole community.\n\nBesides, on our WeChat and Discord communities, we have only 3 moderators of 2000 members, and all of us are working hard every day to bring news about Decentraland and help the new players to start, things like how to create your avatar, how to buy MANA and wearables, how to create wearable and build your scene on the Builder... Also, our community is growing fast and we need people to be focused on these new members.\n\nSeveral links to our previous videos:\n\nhttps://weixin.qq.com/sph/Ap8fsm\n\nhttps://weixin.qq.com/sph/AH3p3L\n\nhttps://weixin.qq.com/sph/AzQAF1\n\n\n## Specification\n\nIf the grant is approved, I'll expand the team to cover more events in Decentraland. I'll pay the moderators to be motivated and also have more time in there helping the new members and bringing the news every day.\n\nThis grant is enough to pay the cost for 3 months.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nBEAM studio is a globally-based studio. BEAM Studio originated from a global community of high-quality creators, where we are committed to exploring brand-new ways digital natives interact with information, space, and each other, as our name suggests, Build Exciting Adventures in Metaverse. Meanwhile, we aim to bring together global creators to create various experiences to promote the process of metaverse construction and build virtual worlds beyond imagination.\n\nNow it has expanded into a community of metaverse builders including creators, developers, business operators, and Web3 investment and research personnel. We are dedicated to cultivating web3 newbies, and helping newbies understand blockchain technology, Web3 environment and opportunities for creators. We will lead them to complete the migration and adaptation to Web3.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe will post new subtitled content at least once a week on multiple Chinese platforms (WeChat, bilibili, and Red). If there is an event in Decentraland, we can produce more. We will post weekly events and news about Decentraland in Chinese on WeChat groups. We are also gonna spend some grants to teach people that want to become creators using professional programs and knowledge.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9c9aea50-e79e-11ec-82d9-d917cdd158ac)**",

    "title": "Wear Essentials - Wearables for everyone",
    "body": "> by 0x82d54417fc69681dc74a6c0c68c6dbad5a2857b9 (Malloy)\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWear Essentials is an application that will offer users the ability to create their own wearables without needing to know 3D technical theory. Wear Essentials will provide an interface for users to build and publish a Decentraland wearable by adding their content to a library of pre-approved templates. The existence of this new platform will reduce barriers to entry for creators and builders in Decentraland to participate in the burgeoning world of digital asset creation, reduce the strain on the wearable-curation committee, and increase revenue back to the Decentraland DAO.\n\nTl;dr - A silk-screening service for Decentraland with increased revenue directed back to the DAO.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xCC7BC60bFcC029ecC8357A9c80b4CC51aF67798E\n\n## Description\n\n### Problem:\n\nThe current technical requirements for wearables to be approved into the Decentraland ecosystem can be daunting for new users in the space.  The Decentraland wearable creation process currently has a steep learning curve for non-technical 3D artists who want to express themselves or facilitate a brand experience. 2D artists currently are completely dependent on 3D artists to be included into the ecosystem; an inadvertent gate set up by the current wearables submission paradigm.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, non-3D-proficient submissions often lead to delays in the curation process as multiple rounds of submissions and back-and-forth between the curation committee can occur before a final design is honed and approved. This excessive iteration could lead to delays for brand items to be ready for events on time, but also strains the wearable-curation committee as the submission fee does not account for the time the experts ultimately spend reviewing.\n\n### Solution:\n\nWear Essentials will provide a platform for aspiring wearables creators to design wearables without technical barriers. An easy to navigate user experience will allow creators to upload a 2D image and see their graphic presented on a catalog of essential wearables in real time. The solution will then manage the submission and curation process, deploy the wearables, and provide analytics with feedback about their uptake and distribution.\n\nUpon submission to the wearables committee - an action which will be available right in the platform - the whole process of deployment and royalty management can be handled. Through use of payment splitter contracts on polygon, an allocation of creator funds raised through primary and secondary sales can be shared with the DAO.\n\nThe collection of templates can also be expanded over time in partnership with brands and organizations.\n\nIt makes it easier for creators as the platform will provide a set of guardrails to produce quality wearables. A set of template wearables - hats, shirts, sweaters, shoes - provide a foundation to ensure the end result will have the correct poly-counts and vertex weighting. Creators can then upload 2D imagery to be mapped on the templates. Users only need to make choices on template color and placement/size of the 2D image content to result in a wearable ready for submission to the committee. This opens up the whole ecosystem to 2D artists (illustrators, graphic designers, tattoo and traditional).\n\nIt reduces the burden on the DAO Wearables Committee as submissions coming direct from the platform have less for the team to review. Confident that the poly-counts and assets are templated, the focus can then be placed on the guidelines for the 2D images that users uploaded (approved content, IP-infringement issues, etc…).\n\nIt will increase revenue to the DAO in a few ways. Through the simplification of the wearables submission process, this platform may lead to an increase in submissions to the DAO. In addition, payment splitters or similar payment rails can be put in place to enforce revenue sharing of primary and secondary sales revenue directly with the DAO. Note that while the purpose of this initiative is to primarily build engagement and increase participation in the wearable creation process, we believe it does not hurt to add additional subsidies back to the DAO where possible.\n\nOnce the application is public we will release opensource to the community with a well documented guide!\n\n\n## Specification\n\nHere is a graphical [pitch deck](https://indd.adobe.com/view/9cbd17ae-f9ec-4b4e-8e13-4619d2e8ad9f).\\\n*Discrepancy regarding the submission price in the pitch deck, this has now changed due to recent proposals*\n\nHere is an early mock up provided by our designer.

With extensive experience in 3D asset production, its members have created dozens of wearables and have worked on projects such as the Metaverse Festival ‘21, AO Metaverse and MTFW.\n\n[Atlas Corporation](https://twitter.com/AtlasCorp_dcl) is a somewhat mysterious team of web3 innovation developers who call Decentraland their home. Atlas Corporation has worked on initiatives directly interfacing with the Decentraland wearables contract and has deep experience [with analytics related to Decentraland wearables and assets](http://wearables.atlascorp.io).\n\n[Tim Phelan](https://www.timphelan.net/) is an independent designer that bridges the gap between product design and branding. With his flair for image making, terrible puns and enhanced user experiences, it is no wonder that Decentraland has become his second home.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### Our approach will consist of:\n\n*   A strong UX/UI design concepting stage\n*   A sprint period to combine 3D assets with the UX/UI and prepare assets for development.\n*   Contract and back end development to innovate bridging between these elements\n\n### Fund Allocation:\n\n#### Art and Asset Creation\n\n*   Platform branding and design\n*   Platform user experience design\n*   First wave of ‘Wear Essentials’ 3d asset templates\n*   Promotional and educational materials\n\n#### Development\n\n*   Scrum master / project management\n*   Front end site engineering\n*   Template to Wearable technology (to be innovated)\n*   Wearables analytics / revenue to DAO tracking\n*   Site infrastructure and hosting\n*   Integration of wearable submission process\n*   Payment-splitter deployment\n\nWe will be sure to show graphical updates in the DAO discord to share with, and receive feedback from, the community.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b7334300-e751-11ec-82d9-d917cdd158ac)**",

You can read the grant proposal [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b8219300-900f-11ec-9794-c9ea21a9ed8f).\n\nBack then, a prototype version existed, but the mapping script was buggy, the map hadn’t been updated in a while, and the site was very basic and not very performant.\nSince getting the first grant, we’ve updated the map monthly. We’ve also worked on improving the mapping script in order to reduce the human interventions needed to complete a full map and we’ve greatly reduced the time needed for the script to run. We’re now confident we can provide weekly (instead of monthly) updates. We’ve also added a “Jump in” button that allows the user to jump into the scene at the right-clicked coordinates.\n\nWe received a great deal of feedback and requests to develop new features.\nThis grant will set up a budget, including salaries and expenses (web hosting, image storage, and domain name renewal, for now), to run this team for the next 6 months of developments and updates. Further grants will be requested by us in the future if the community continues to be happy with our work.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nA working version can be found on https://genesis.city/\n\nSite code: https://github.com/maraoz/genesis.city/\n\nWe’re using GitHub to host the images, and Netlify to handle deployments and building the website.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n*   **maraoz** - original map prototype creator, will oversee that the project’s vision is aligned with the Decentraland community (Product Owner Role). Will also act as Project Manager until a replacement is found and hired.\n    https://github.com/maraoz\n*   **Rodrigo Heredia** - Full Stack Unity3d + Web Developer https://github.com/rheredia-dev\n*   **Project Manager**: to be hired. Making interviews now with 3 candidates.\n\nBudget: $6,050 USD per month, resulting in $36,300 USD grant total.\nThis monthly budget includes:\n\n*   Team compensation : $6,024/month\n*   Operational expenses: $26/month\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nAn updated version of the map will be live weekly.  We'll also create an NFT on Rarible with the full map once per month. The map’s content will be updated via script every week for 6 months.  Once that time has elapsed we will request another grant in order to provide further maintenance and updates. Other than that, these are the things we’ll  be working on (we also want to be flexible to adopt future community feedback, so don’t take this as set in stone).\n\n**June 2022**: Automate zoom layer creation and optimize mapping script. Start running the mapping script weekly.\\\n**July 2022**: Resolve pending problematic tiles bugs and start work on new mapping script traversal algorithm (screenshot already loaded scenes before moving to next unexplored tile)\\\n**August 2022**: Show visually when a tile changed recently. Finish new mapping script traversal algorithm.\\\n**September 2022**: Add a first overlay layer to the map (options are: estate delimitations, go-to-marketplace for tiles on sale, show districts, points of interest, or colors by owners).\\\n**October 2022 and on**: Add more overlay layer(s) based on previous list or community feedback, or additional community feedback implementations.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4fad3e80-e74b-11ec-82d9-d917cdd158ac)**",

It was released in September 2021 as a collaboration from UltraDAO artists. Offering a mixed model of de/centralized IP ownership, it conveys family-friendly, story-driven artwork and themes supporting nature and conservation. Woodies has also funded a ‘One Million Tree’ campaign with non-profit organization Trees for the Future. Woodies has nurtured a warm and inclusive culture, and is also hosting live outings in real life – hiking, rafting, etc. Congregating in Decentraland offers a way to involve a global\ncommunity that cannot attend every event, and a way to sustain and deepen the connections our members are already making with one another.\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n9739\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOfficial website is linked with the names and social media of our team here:\n\nhttps://www.woodiesnft.com/team\n\nThe website is linked from our official Opensea collection and twitter bio.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nOur goal for Woodies in Decentraland is to create immersive and evolving experiences that bring the community together through storytelling, shared interests and goals. The artwork, including the 900+ original traits, has been transformed into the fun aesthetic style of Decentraland and is ready for use as ‘linked wearables’. How cool is it going to be to turn your avatar into a tree-like Woodie and see your 2D Woodie come to life!? We will create a home for Woodies where we can gather for our weekly community meetings, create exhibitions, invite guest speakers such as our partner charities and more. Ultimately Woodies is eager to push the boundaries of what is possible and explore new frontiers for art and engagement in Decentraland.\n\n\n## Smart Contract Address\n\n- 0x134460d32fc66a6d84487c20dcd9fdcf92316017\n\n\n## Manager Addresses\n\n- 0x8367A713bc14212Ab1bB8c55A778e43e50B8b927\n- 0x81745b7339D5067E82B93ca6BBAd125F214525d3\n- 0x609399fc46eB745A0E28AE37C786089a5D8dC501\n\n\n## Is this collection generated programmatically?\n- Yes\n\n\n## Method\n\nWe created a master file with all traits (hair, nose, mouth, eyes, accessories, clothing, etc), named the 3D objects to match the original collection's 2D attributes, then run a batch script that creates individual 3D skin files with the correct traits based on the 2D counterpart.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9001a490-e67d-11ec-9a81-b1d70acf7d8d)**",

Jan 2022 -  [Resignation of Eric from the DAO Committee.](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/resignation-from-the-dao-committee/4705)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn the past year,  [one committee member has sent +500 transactions](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe91C0c482E09600f2d1DBCA10FD705BC6de60bc)  in the name of the DAO. Thanks to  [the proposal of reimbursement of gas fees](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f3f19d40-17ff-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) , this operation doesn’t have a monetary loss for the committee members. **However, each of these transactions required attention to review/sign and those efforts are not being compensated in any form**.\nAdding to this situation, one of the initial three committee members resigned early this year. It has been hard to find a replacement who can take such a responsibility and willing to do it for free.\n\n**Compensate DAO Committee members is fundamental for a sustainable DAO operation.**\n\n\n## Specification\n\nEstablish a monthly payment of 2,400 USD payable in MANA each month. The amount is established in USD to avoid problems related to MANA's price volatility.\n\nEach committee member will commit to working 10hrs per week at a rate of 60 USD/hr.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nSetting compensation to the DAO Committee will attract and retain members with the required know-how to take such a responsibility. Having a strong DAO Committee will ensure the timely operations of the DAO.\n\nThis proposal specifies a fixed compensation per month regardless of the activity of the committee member. This might be a risk for a committee with many members, where the work of verifying transactions is done by a sub-set of the group. At the moment the committee only has 2 members and this is not a problem, but it would be interesting to transition to a performance-based compensation in the future (e.g. based on the number of transactions initiated and signed by the member).\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe DAO Committee already has control of the DAO Treasury and is responsible for making payments to the Curators Committee and funding Grants voted by the DAO.\n\nThe DAO Committee will issue the compensation to itself at the beginning of every month by sending 2,400 USD worth of MANA (using the current market price).\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOver the past year, the DAO Committee has been proven essential for the regular operations of the DAO. However this position has been voluntary for almost a year, and it requires substantial work from the members of the committee to cover their responsibilities.\n\nSetting compensation for its members is key to attracting qualified candidates to join the committee and securing the timely operations of the DAO long-term.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f3c126e0-e5a1-11ec-9a81-b1d70acf7d8d)**",

    "title": "For Decentraland Daily Active Users: MANA incentives for USDC-ICE LP",
    "body": "> by 0x091f3b14a3323819c36ad0ec1298f97f0c7e0caa\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[For Decentraland Daily Active Users: MANA incentives for USDC-ICE LP](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8ce58760-dc80-11ec-8ad9-ab7454ba5993)\n\n## Summary\n\nAllocate $1mm USD worth of MANA to provide rewards for the ICE-USDC liquidity pool on QuickSwap; wherein, MANA rewards will be distributed over 3 months to those that stake USDC-ICE LP tokens.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nDaily active and concurrent users are Decentraland’s key differentiator within the nascent metaverse space, where several new competing virtual world platforms are launching and investing millions of dollars into engaging content creation. The LP rewards are a bridge to begin reversing DCL’s DAU decline and return to growth. ICE Poker SNG is a new, competitive game mode that drives organic demand and utility for ICE as it offers highly skilled players a quicker clearer path to wearable ownership. Following this temporary 3 month rewards period and the launch of ICE Poker SNG, the ICE Poker ecosystem will be self-sufficient and long-term sustainable.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDecentral Games ICE Poker is the first free play-and earn poker game launched in Decentraland in October 2021 that accounts for ~60% of Decentraland’s weekly active users. If you hop into Decentraland and view the top scenes, you will be directed to an ICE Poker venue where you can play and interact with thousands of other real people, a social experience that no other open metaverse platform has been able to deliver.\n\nICE Poker has onboarded and will continue to onboard users into Decentraland and the Decentraland wearables ecosystem by delivering direct utility through self-custody and delegation of Decentraland wearables. After creating a Decentraland avatar and purchasing a wearable to play ICE Poker, many players explore other scenes and invest in adjacent Decentraland projects, as well as create their own inspired by ICE Poker.\n\nIn addition to ICE Poker, Decentral Games venues also host daily virtual events such as live music, artist showcases, NFT drop parties, comedy shows, and more.\n\nThe stats today:\n\n*   12 live Decentraland venues\n*   1,007 parcels of Decentraland LAND\n*   8,000+ daily active players\n*   203,000+ monthly visitors across all venues (April 2022)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAllocate $1mm USD worth of MANA to provide rewards for the ICE-USDC liquidity pool on QuickSwap. MANA rewards will be distributed over 3 months to those that stake USDC-ICE LP tokens.\n\n### Details:\n\n*   Within 10 days following the final binding proposal passing, $1M USD of MANA would be sent to dgtreasury.eth to distribute to folks staking the ICE-USDC LP.\n*   MANA will be distributed by smart contract, available claim in proportion to the amount of LP staked and the amount of time that LP is staked.\n*   0 MANA will be earned/retained by the DG DAO Treasury and DG Team. Specifically, the DG DAO will not stake the LP it provides to the pool, so all rewards will go to community members staking LP tokens.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nDaily active and concurrent users are Decentraland’s key differentiator within the nascent metaverse space: The competition is spending on development and promises eventual users; DCL has users.\n\nThis proposal will support the ICE price and thereby maintain DCL DAU while SNGs ramp up, but this describes only half the equation and represents the small upside to DCL. In the true \"upside scenario,\" SNG closes the remaining gap toward making the ICE economics sustainable, and the ICE Poker ecosystem succeeds in onboarding millions of players into Decentraland. Half of the gap to sustainability has already been closed, and, in short, the proposal helps bridge the remainder across 3 months, reversing DCL's DAU decline in the short term and facilitates returning to growth sooner. The \"downside scenario\" is that SNG does not succeed in spite of substantial progress made to-date and this proposal only serves to sustain DCL DAU while rewards are deployed.\n\nThe mechanics of of LP rewards sustain the ICE price are straightforward: Rewarding the ICE-USDC LP pool (while excluding the DG DAO LP from being rewarded) will generate incremental demand for ICE. It's challenging to predict the exact amount of this demand in advance; this would cause a significant amount of ICE to be taken out of circulation and placed in the pool; as a result, the ICE price will be supported while SNG is releases and ramps up.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nAs outlined in the 'Specification' section, the only required step for implementation by the DCL DAO itself will be for the DCL DAO to transfer $1M MANA to dgtreasury.eth. The DG Team will deploy on Polygon their audited LP rewards smart contract that was previously used to reward the ETH-DG LP pool and apply this reward ICE-USDC LP on QuickSwap. MANA Rewards will be distributed to those who stake these LP tokens as outlined in the 'Specification' section and a UI will be provided on https://decentral.games/dg/liquidity.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDaily active and concurrent users are Decentraland’s key differentiator within the nascent metaverse space, where several new competing virtual world platforms are launching and investing millions of dollars into engaging content creation.\n\n**This proposed MANA allocation is not a grant for the Decentral Games team** – its entire purpose is to maintain daily active and concurrent users within the Decentraland and Decentral Games ecosystems as the Decentral Games team completes development and launches ICE Poker SNG. The LP rewards are a bridge to begin reversing DCL’s DAU decline and return to growth.\n\nICE Poker SNG is a new, competitive game mode that drives organic demand and utility for ICE as it offers highly skilled players a quicker clearer path to wearable ownership. Following this temporary 3 month rewards period and the launch of ICE Poker SNG, the ICE Poker ecosystem will be self-sufficient and long-term sustainable.\n\nSince the Stage 1 proposal was posted, it’s been inspiring to see all the stories of Decentraland creators’ events being well-attended by the ICE Poker community, the ICE Poker community investing in other wearable creators/games, and even cases where folks who found Decentraland via DG have since started their own venues, projects, and games in Decentraland. This initiative would welcome ICE Poker players (folks who use Decentraland every day), wearable owners, and the Decentraland community at large to provide this LP, earn MANA, and further participate in the Decentraland DAO.\n\n**Why should the Decentraland DAO itself fund these rewards?**\n\nThe Decentraland DAO has assigned $200mm in MANA to their Ecosystem Fund to fund development of engaging content in Decentraland. ICE Poker has already proven its ability to deliver value to Decentraland by driving the majority of Decentraland’s daily active and concurrent user growth in 2022. The majority of the Decentral Games treasury is locked in illiquid Decentraland LAND, LP for DG and ICE, and a Polygon Validator node.\n\n**Why $1mm and why 3 months?**\n\n$1mm USD in MANA would provide sufficient rewards over a 3 month period to allow the Decentral Games team to deliver on building, launching, and growing ICE Poker SNG, which will enable the ecosystem to self-sustain following the ending of the rewards.\n\n**From a proposal execution perspective, why should DG distribute the MANA rewards?**\n\nThe DG DAO has already implemented audited smart contracts to make rewards tokens claimable for staked LP on decentral.games, so it makes sense for DG to do this execution. To reiterate, the DG Treasury and Decentral Games will earn 0 MANA. The rewards will go entirely to the community.\n\n**A note from the DG Project Lead and Founder, Miles Anthony:**\n\n\"We’ve had conviction around Decentraland and its role in delivering an interactive 3D frontend for the open metaverse from its inception in 2017. Since then, we’ve purchased 1000+ parcels of LAND and invested millions of dollars to build engaging content to attract and retain over 60% of the platform’s users. This MANA allocation is a stepping stone to assist in stabilizing our in-game economy as we prepare to launch ICE Poker Sit-n-Go tournaments, along with other key initiatives that drive organic demand and utility for ICE and solidify our ecosystem’s long term sustainability. With the support of the Decentraland team and community, we look forward to onboarding the next million users into Decentraland and the nascent metaverse.\"\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=99c66b90-e2d2-11ec-9000-175d8dd584b8)**",

    "title": "Restructuring Wearables Submission Fees",
    "body": "> by 0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc (Yemel#60bc)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Halt the implementation of the Governance Proposal to adjust the creators fee to reflect a set fiat value of $500](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e1fcd600-d7a2-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)\n\n## Summary\n\nSet the wearable submission to $150 USD worth of MANA and set the curators compensation to $50 USD per item reviewed.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to align the DCL community about how the wearable submission fee should be structured. The proposal gives more context about the history, motivations and economics of the fee and also proposes a new scheme.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Wearables Marketplace was originally launched on  [June 1st 2021](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor/) , with the goal of empowering a creators economy by giving users a wide variety of choices to express themselves and giving creators the tools to monetize their work.\n\nEvery creator that submits a new wearable to the marketplace is asked to pay a fee in MANA (Wearable Submission Fee). This fee is necessary to:\n\n*   Cover the compensation of the curator that will review the submission to ensure technical soundness and protect against IP infringements.\n\n*   Limit the cost of *perpetually* hosting the wearable in the Catalyst Decentralized Network.\n\n*   Foster the continual growth of Decentraland platform and its community via giving those fees to the DAO and funding the Community Grants program.\n\nThe wearable submission fee was originally set to 500 MANA, with a MANA price of ~0.8 USD. However when the MANA price reached the $2 USD mark the community raised their concerns via  [a proposal to automatically adjust the fee to a fixed amount of 500 USD payable in MANA was voted.](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)\n\nThe proposal noted that pegging the publication fee to USD was healthy for the creators’ economy. It allows the creators to better budget their projects and market their services without exposing them to the fluctuation of the MANA price.\n\nThe proposal was raised to the Security Advisory Board and decided to lower the wearable submission fee one-time to 100 MANA as a temporary measure in the waiting for an automated solution. This change was announced in the  [DAO Committee Report #12](https://decentraland.org/blog/project-updates/dao-committee-report-12/) .\n\nSince then, the price of MANA has come down to the $1 USD mark and the current fee seems too low. The curator committee is getting 10 MANA per item review and it doesn’t seem up to the responsibility of the role. At the same time, going back to a 500 USD fee is shocking for new creators in the Decetraland community.\n\nThis proposal aims to restructure the current wearable submission fee to a more sustainable framework. The goal is to keep the fee at minimum while still covering the expenses for the marketplace to work.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nBelow is the specification of how the Wearable Submission Fee should be structured:\n\n*   The fee amount should be set at a fixed USD price, but paid in MANA.\n\n*   The fee should cover the work of a curator to review the submission.\n\n*   The fee should support the catalyst network.\n\n*   The fee should support the DAO to continue investing in Grants.\n\nThe first item has been addressed by the Decentraland Foundation team by creating a new version of the marketplace smart contracts that uses a Chainlink oracle to get the current MANA price. This way the fee is paid in MANA but the amount is set in USD.\n\nRegarding the compensation of the curator for each review, a price of **$50 USD per item reviewed** seems fair. The curation might take between 30 minutes and several hours depending on the feedback cycles with creators.\n\nThe catalyst network is currently formed by 11 servers that hosts all the content of Decentraland’s world, including wearable 3d models, scene content and avatar selections. Half of the Catalyst servers are runned by Decentraland Foundation and the rest by individual community members.\n\nThe cost of hosting a Catalyst server is ~600 USD per month. The total annual cost to run the 11 servers is ~$80,000 USD. At this moment this cost is paid by catalyst owners and is not subsidized by the DAO, but it totally should, **and part of the Wearable Submission Fee should be allocated to subsidize catalyst owners.**\n\nIn the past year 5,530 wearables have been submitted to the marketplace, so if we maintain this publication rate, **a fee of 15 USD per wearable** should be enough to account for catalyst expenses for a year.\n\nAnd finally, the DAO should get a fee to continue investing in the Grants Program, fostering the development and growth of the platform. **A contribution between 50 and 100 USD should be allocated for this purpose.**\n\n**Wearable Submission Fee = 150 USD**\n\n*   33% = 50 USD go to the curator\n*   10% = 15 USD to supporting catalyst servers\n*   57% = 85 USD goig to the DAO to support the Grant’s Program.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal aims to set the wearable submission fee to a USD value in order to better support the creators economy, derisking them from market volatility, enabling to budget projects and market their services at a expectable rate.\n\nEconomics considerations have been made to ensure that a fee of 150 USD can cover the compensation of the curators, a subsidy to the catalyst network and keep reinvesting in the growth of the platform.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=128084f0-e1dc-11ec-bdb6-655e1f599935)**",

    "body": "> by 0x2d779a930567f54899336c3f7f2dbaf804a25c78 (AnimatorKirk#5c78)\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nCreate an interactive immersive VR/Desktop Ride Simulator Attraction within Decentraland.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n160,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x49c54146FC13b0229942b37fEE4Bf316aD6E9953\n\n## Description\n\nI, Kirk Gonzales, the CEO of Animation Studio Lightspeed Graphics, LLC (lightspeedgfx.com) is requesting a grant of $160,000 to build a Metaverse Ride Simulator Attraction experience within Decentraland.\n\nLightspeed Graphics is an Animation studio from California producing 2D Motion Graphics, 3D Animation, AR/VR, Game Design and Visual Effects. Lightspeed Graphics was launched in 2017 to create multimedia digital video experiences, commercial advertising, and graphic design, and would like to be the first to develop a new and exciting animated attraction within Decentraland.\n\nThe Lightspeed Graphics team believes in the need to bring Virtual Reality and storytelling as a truly rewarding and engaging experience to face challenges like user adoption, market size capture, and player satisfaction or retention among many other determinants. The VR industry will become more prevalent and interconnected to metaverse web3 applications as we reach mass adoption in the coming years and as new projects make their own unique metaverse-like experience.\n\nThe idea was inspired by the classic Ride Simulator Attractions seen at amusement parks, exhibits or tech museums that have been enjoyed for generations. We believe bringing this ride simulator experience into the metaverse will help bring value to Decentraland and help transition real world attractions or experiences into a connected metaverse experience.\n\nVeteran players and new players from AR/VR users, gamers, developers, film industry specialists, MX specialists and quite possibly well-known companies like Dynamic Attractions are all part of the target audience as we carve a space for VR/Desktop Ride Simulator Attractions.\n\nThe Lightspeed Graphics Team and any additional contractors will work closely together to develop a first of its kind Metaverse VR/Desktop Ride Simulator Attraction with a complete narrative storyline, interactivity and future multiplayer experience.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe VR/Desktop Ride simulator will be accessible to the public and be distinguishable by the ‘Jump 2 Lightspeed’ logo. The size will need to be at least a 3x3 estate. The first adventure will be completely free to the public to ride indefinitely and be a learning experience for returning and new users to Decentraland. A crafting system will guide players to create unique wearables, in-game items and trade systems. Later, story add-ons called ‘Arcs’ will be gated by an initial purchase of an NFT, tickets, or subscription.\n\nOnce the Player has been granted access and has clicked the Ride Simulator, they are transported to a fixed chair position with the user’s perspective locked to the view of their avatar, while other avatars can be seen filling empty chair slots, (multiplayer experience), as the ride makes its final countdown to launch. Sponsored videos (will play during the countdown process to and promote other adventures, events, and activities throughout DCL.\n\nOnce the countdown has completed, no other players can join that adventure instance at this point. The lights dim and the animated adventure on screen begins playing.\nThe user has the option to enter fullscreen and see the entire video experience with a full monitor takeover, while the Oculus Headset user is now able to do a full headset takeover.\nThe game itself will feel like a rollercoaster ride through space, complete with narrative, voice over performances. Future development will bring the ability to fire and aim at targets with the mouse or Oculus controllers, making it a complete interactive game.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nLightspeed Graphics:\nKirk Gonzales (CEO / Lead Designer)\nTwitter Handle: @AnmtrKirk\nLinkedin: linkedin.com/in/kirkgonzales\n\nAbout Me: I attended college for a B.A. from 2007 to 2011 in film and video production to learn everything needed behind movies, visual journalism and music videos. Later I worked in television as a fulltime editor, sound engineer and floor operator, before committing full time to my 3D animation. I developed scripts, storyboards, graphics, and character design to develop 2D and 3D animated corporate and commercial videos for fortune 500 clients. I evolved into a client success manager, responsible for creating complete marketing plans and design content for clients with budgets well over $150,000 - $250,000. In 2017 I founded Lightspeed Graphics and have continued to grow the company ever since.\n\nYves Decastro (Operations Manager)\n\nSonny Gonzales (Outreach & Program Manager)\n\nZesty Market (Technologies Consultant & Advertising Partner)\nZesty is a p2p rental protocol for billboards in the metaverse.

Thanks to  [the proposal of reimbursement of gas fees](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f3f19d40-17ff-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) , this operation doesn’t have a monetary loss for the committee members. **However, each of these transactions required attention to review/sign and those efforts are not being compensated in any form**.\nAdding to this situation, one of the initial three committee members resigned early this year. It has been hard to find a replacement who can take such a responsibility and willing to do it for free.\n\n**Compensate DAO Committee members is fundamental for a sustainable DAO operation.**\n\n\n## Specification\n\nEstablish a monthly payment of 2,400 USD payable in MANA each month. The amount is established in USD to avoid problems related to MANA's price volatility.\n\nEach committee member will commit to working 10hrs per week at a rate of 60 USD/hr.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOver the past year, the DAO Committee has been proven essential for the regular operations of the DAO. However this position has been voluntary for almost a year, and it requires substantial work from the members of the committee to cover their responsibilities.\n\nSetting compensation for its members is key to attracting qualified candidates to join the committee and securing the timely operations of the DAO long-term.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9e324210-e01d-11ec-8ad9-ab7454ba5993)**",

    "title": "Balanced Voting Power in Decentraland",
    "body": "> by 0x785c8d210ab8888da6d121faa0a9568f75400b13 (VinnyPiazza)\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nThe goal of this proposal is the balancing of Voting Power across the Decentraland community regardless of contribution method; investor, creator, or consumer. I am proposing a more balanced Voting Power allocation, should the methods of the proposed allocations be feasible and amendable.\n\nPreserving a near relative Voting Power for current leading voters is essential to gain support on getting a more balanced voting system approved and implemented. This proposal conserves the Voting Power of leading voters and adds additional voting power through creative balancing while preventing material dilution.\n\n**ABSTRACT**\n\nThere is an imbalance of Voting Power favoring those with large amounts of MANA or LAND creating a perceived class war. Understanding that MANA and LAND are investments in DCL, they deserve fair Voting Power but no one DCL contribution asset should overshadow the community as a whole. All stakeholders should have an equitable say.\n\n**Current:**\n\n*   1 MANA contributes 1 VP\n*   1 NAME contributes 100 VP\n*   1 LAND parcel contributes 2000 VP\n*   Each Estate is worth 2000 multiplied by the number of single LAND parcels in that Estate. For example, an Estate with 2 parcels will contribute 4000 VP to your total voting power.\n\n**In the Works:**\n\n*   Some L1 wearables will get additional VP based on proposal \"Wearables Working Group: Attach VP to Limited # of L1 Wearable Collections\".\n\n**SPECIFICATION**\n\nBy adding additional voting rights through new allocations using relative contribution and vested interest factors, it disperses the Voting Power across the community in a more equitable way.\n\n**Proposed Additions:**\nIn addition to current Voting Power allocation…\n\n*   1 MANA spent in DCL contributes 1.5 VP (new)\n*   1 WEARABLES CREATED contributes 100 VP (new)\n*   1 EMOTES CREATED contributes 100 VP (new)\n*   ACTIVE DAYS in Decentraland contributes = 1 VP per day (new)\n*   DOB of Decentraland Character = 0.5 VP per day (new)\n\nNAME and LAND owners would be getting a small inherent multiplier for both spending MANA and having their respective Decentraland assets. An additional inherent multiplier is the MANA from LAND proceeds, such as renting, that the asset owner continues to hold in their DCL connected wallet.\n\nWEARABLE CREATORS would be getting a inherent multiplier for both spending MANA (in DCL) and being a content creator for DCL. An additional multiplier is the MANA proceeds from wearable sales that continue to be held in their DCL connected wallet.\n\nThese are reasonable inherent multipliers that give greater weight to those that have long term horizons on the success of DCL. These investments are not as easy to divest giving them more incentive for long term growth of Decentraland.\n\n**MOTIVATION**\n\nThis proposal for balancing Voting Power in Decentraland gives investors, creators, & consumers more equitable voting power allowing for the voices and opinions of the community to be heard. This creates a vested interest in the betterment of Decentraland and ultimately more engagement. This promotes investments that create stickiness to DCL which increases the value of past contributions (investments) in DCL. Some of the additional Voting Power also promotes spending in Decentraland which gives the DAO more revenue to service DCL.\n\nI would expect future proposals for re-balancing as the community and its contributing members grow, however the members choose to contribute.\n\n- Add New VP Allocations\n- Leave VP As Is\n- Abstain\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=dfc7a4d0-e019-11ec-8ad9-ab7454ba5993)**",

The OnChainChain is a whimsical high end piece of metaverse fashion that exemplifies the owner’s understanding of these important fundamental constructs.  A wide variety of chains, totems & accessories designed by Miguelgarest result in unique & prominent wearable chains.\n\nOnChainChains are standalone pieces of art that also provide the collector with the ability to wear it across multiple NFTs & platforms.  The ability to wear the same OnChainChain everywhere allows the user to be recognizable even while changing avatars across the metaverse.\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n2000\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nI'm not sure the above smart contract address is correct but i'm sure i can find the correct information if not.  This was a project we launched on artblocks if you need any formal verification i can ask them and it will be no problem. https://www.artblocks.io/project/283\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe built the OnChainChain with the intention of building it out to become a fully onchain interoperable wearable to be worn across many virtual worlds.  Currently the owners of the chains are using them in various capacities across several different projects and platforms but there is a very large demand for the wearable chains to be compatible in decentraland, so any help would be appreciated by myself and the community.\n\n\n## Smart Contract Address\n\n- 0xa7d8d9ef8D8Ce8992Df33D8b8CF4Aebabd5bD270\n\n\n## Manager Addresses\n\n- 0x81E5cd19323ce7f6b36c9511fbC98d477a188b13\n- 0x32f01b73Ef5d9d371F6D1Fd82cC2aF3a5c66091C\n\n\n## Is this collection generated programmatically?\n- Yes\n\n\n## Method\n\nThis was a randomly generated project of 2000 wearable chains launched on artblocks.  I am happy to find more specific information if needed.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a9a78f10-dcfd-11ec-8ad9-ab7454ba5993)**",

We are MetaPlay®, a newly founded NFT development company with the sole desire to innovate and expand the horizons of Decentraland and the metaverse as a whole. Our first NFT project is called TheCryptoChickenCollective. (For a sample, go check out the info on specifications below!) With this project, we are fulfilling a major desire for Decentraland 's user base, which is the need for having a companion animal that follows you around. Until now, this was currently only available as a static wearable that is constrained to your avatar and mimics your steps... we thought this simply wasn't enough. Our chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!\n\nTheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating Decentraland's first pet that moves independent of the users avatar motions. In addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect the overall statistics of it. As our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another RIGHT IN DECENTRALAND! That’s right! Never before has anyone accomplished an animated companion that could be seen by all users and could fight right in Decentraland... until now. All previous \"fight\" projects have users do the actual “fighting” on a completely different website and server. We wanted to take it a step further. For the first time in history, the CryptoChickens will allow for its users to mint, raise, and fight your companions against your friends right in Decentraland. Side note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) a real possibility in the near future \"winky face\".\n\nWe believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL. While we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest. Although we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap!\n\nUpon all the amazing feedback we received on our last proposal we have made significant changes to the funding request for our project. Originally our project asked for 240k for development which we believe could greatly benefit not only this project but Decentraland as a whole by way of the technological advances our project proves to bring in the near future. With that said, we fully understand and acknowledge the concerns some had regarding our lack of history in DCL and giving such a large grant to a brand new project. For this reason we have elected to reduce our original asking amount by 90%. With this new grant we strongly believe we can develop this project into one which we calculate could bring up to 1000+ new DAUs to DCL.\nThe 24k will spend as follows (over a 6 month period)\n\n*   1.5k per month for marketing\n*   2.5k per month for development\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOur developer and designer are world class professionals, with over 30 years of experience in their respective industries. Our designer has done animation, and graphics for a variety of television, film and corporate projects and our developer has played a key role in the development of software for NASA, Unity, and Lightwave 3D. Due to the proprietary nature of the coding we are unable to disclose the exact manner in which we achieved the animated companions but we hope that our current example on our Land (22,89) will prove to be enough evidence that we know what we are doing and can deliver everything promised in a timely manner. Basically we created a cool looking chicken that, while in the beta testing phase, anyone can try out and enjoy within our C.C.C. partnered LAND. To check out what all the hype is about please visit our land at: ChickenLand (22,89) (link provided below)\n(INSTRUCTIONS: Click the red box on the corner (only once), wait for it to turn green, then go to the middle statue and click summon your chicken. Disclaimer: we have yet to add additional AI functionalities and coloring to the chicken, but will do so immediately following our first drop. The first drop will be a wearable in the form of a gold chain that enables your pet chicken to show up behind you once equipped on your avatar.)\n\nFor more detailed information pertaining to our project please visit The Crypto Chicken Collective whitepaper: https://docs.metaplay.cafe/\n\nAny and all updates on our project will be relayed through the following channels:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/\\_CryptoChickens\n\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/8VwaMV3vcw\n\nProject’s links: https://linktr.ee/cryptochickencollective\n(Website is still under construction... brand new website coming soon!!!)\n\nFor access to The Crypto Chicken Collective official land plot click the link below:\n\nDecentraland ChickenLand: https://play.decentraland.org/?island=I1be6x\\&position=22%2C89\\&realm=dg\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n@Trag (CTO) ➺ software architect with over 30 years of experience in every aspect of the game industry, from high speed server design to graphics and gameplay.

Never before has anyone accomplished an animated companion that could be seen by all users and could fight right in Decentraland... until now. All previous \"fight\" projects have users do the actual “fighting” on a completely different website and server. We wanted to take it a step further. For the first time in history, the CryptoChickens will allow for its users to mint, raise, and fight your companions against your friends right in Decentraland. Side note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) a real possibility in the near future \"winky face\".\n\nWe believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL. While we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest. Although we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap!\n\nUpon all the amazing feedback we received on our last proposal we have made significant changes to the funding request for our project. Originally our project asked for 240k for development which we believe could greatly benefit not only this project but Decentraland as a whole by way of the technological advances our project proves to bring in the near future. With that said, we fully understand and acknowledge the concerns some had regarding our lack of history in DCL and giving such a large grant to a brand new project. For this reason we have elected to reduce our original asking amount by 90%. With this new grant we strongly believe we can develop this project into one which we calculate could bring up to 1000+ new DAUs to DCL.\nThe 24k will spend as follows (over a 6 month period)\n\n*   1.5k per month for marketing\n*   2.5k per month for development\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOur developer and designer are world class professionals, with over 30 years of experience in their respective industries. Our designer has done animation, and graphics for a variety of television, film and corporate projects and our developer has played a key role in the development of software for NASA, Unity, and Lightwave 3D. Due to the proprietary nature of the coding we are unable to disclose the exact manner in which we achieved the animated companions but we hope that our current example on our Land (22,89) will prove to be enough evidence that we know what we are doing and can deliver everything promised in a timely manner. Basically we created a cool looking chicken that, while in the beta testing phase, anyone can try out and enjoy within our C.C.C. partnered LAND. To check out what all the hype is about please visit our land at: ChickenLand (22,89) (link provided below)\n\n(INSTRUCTIONS: Click the red box on the corner (only once), wait for it to turn green, then go to the middle statue and click summon your chicken. Disclaimer: we have yet to add additional AI functionalities and coloring to the chicken, but will do so immediately following our first drop. The first drop will be a wearable in the form of a gold chain that enables your pet chicken to show up behind you once equipped on your avatar.)\n\nFor more detailed information pertaining to our whitepaper please visit:\n\nThe Crypto Chicken Collective whitepaper: https://docs.metaplay.cafe/\n\nAny and all updates on our project will be relayed through the following channels:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/\\_CryptoChickens\n\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/8VwaMV3vcw\n\nProject’s links: https://linktr.ee/cryptochickencollective\n(Website is still under construction... brand new website coming soon!!!)\n\nFor access to The Crypto Chicken Collective official land plot click the link below:\n\nDecentraland ChickenLand: https://play.decentraland.org/?island=I1be6x\\&position=22%2C89\\&realm=dg\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n@Trag (CTO) ➺ software architect with over 30 years of experience in every aspect of the game industry, from high speed server design to graphics and gameplay.

    "title": "For Decentraland Daily Active Users: MANA incentives for USDC-ICE LP",
    "body": "> by 0xbef99f5f55cf7cdb3a70998c57061b7e1386a9b0\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[MANA incentives for USDC-ICE LP on QuickSwap](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ece9b3e0-d7c9-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)\n\n## Summary\n\nAllocate $1mm USD worth of MANA to provide rewards for the ICE-USDC liquidity pool on QuickSwap; wherein, MANA rewards will be distributed over 3 months to those that stake USDC-ICE LP tokens.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nDaily active and concurrent users are Decentraland’s key differentiator within the nascent metaverse space, where several new competing virtual world platforms are launching and investing millions of dollars into engaging content creation. The LP rewards are a bridge to begin reversing DCL’s DAU decline and return to growth. ICE Poker SNG is a new, competitive game mode that drives organic demand and utility for ICE as it offers highly skilled players a quicker clearer path to wearable ownership. Following this temporary 3 month rewards period and the launch of ICE Poker SNG, the ICE Poker ecosystem will be self-sufficient and long-term sustainable.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDecentral Games ICE Poker is the first free play-and earn poker game launched in Decentraland in October 2021 that accounts for ~60% of Decentraland’s weekly active users. If you hop into Decentraland and view the top scenes, you will be directed to an ICE Poker venue where you can play and interact with thousands of other real people, a social experience that no other open metaverse platform has been able to deliver.\n\nICE Poker has onboarded and will continue to onboard users into Decentraland and the Decentraland wearables ecosystem by delivering direct utility through self-custody and delegation of Decentraland wearables. After creating a Decentraland avatar and purchasing a wearable to play ICE Poker, many players explore other scenes and invest in adjacent Decentraland projects, as well as create their own inspired by ICE Poker.\n\nIn addition to ICE Poker, Decentral Games venues also host daily virtual events such as live music, artist showcases, NFT drop parties, comedy shows, and more.\n\nThe stats today:\n\n*   12 live Decentraland venues\n*   1,007 parcels of Decentraland LAND\n*   8,000+ daily active players\n*   203,000+ monthly visitors across all venues (April 2022)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAllocate $1mm USD worth of MANA to provide rewards for the ICE-USDC liquidity pool on QuickSwap. MANA rewards will be distributed over 3 months to those that stake USDC-ICE LP tokens.\n\n### Details:\n\n*   Within 10 days following the final binding proposal passing, $1M USD of MANA would be sent to dgtreasury.eth to distribute to folks staking the ICE-USDC LP.\n*   MANA will be distributed by smart contract, available claim in proportion to the amount of LP staked and the amount of time that LP is staked.\n*   0 MANA will be earned/retained by the DG DAO Treasury and DG Team. Specifically, the DG DAO will not stake the LP it provides to the pool, so all rewards will go to community members staking LP tokens.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDaily active and concurrent users are Decentraland’s key differentiator within the nascent metaverse space, where several new competing virtual world platforms are launching and investing millions of dollars into engaging content creation.\n\n**This proposed MANA allocation is not a grant for the Decentral Games team** – its entire purpose is to maintain daily active and concurrent users within the Decentraland and Decentral Games ecosystems as the Decentral Games team completes development and launches ICE Poker SNG. The LP rewards are a bridge to begin reversing DCL’s DAU decline and return to growth.\n\nICE Poker SNG is a new, competitive game mode that drives organic demand and utility for ICE as it offers highly skilled players a quicker clearer path to wearable ownership. Following this temporary 3 month rewards period and the launch of ICE Poker SNG, the ICE Poker ecosystem will be self-sufficient and long-term sustainable.\n\nSince the Stage 1 proposal was posted, it’s been inspiring to see all the stories of Decentraland creators’ events being well-attended by the ICE Poker community, the ICE Poker community investing in other wearable creators/games, and even cases where folks who found Decentraland via DG have since started their own venues, projects, and games in Decentraland. This initiative would welcome ICE Poker players (folks who use Decentraland every day), wearable owners, and the Decentraland community at large to provide this LP, earn MANA, and further participate in the Decentraland DAO.\n\n**Why should the Decentraland DAO itself fund these rewards?**\n\nThe Decentraland DAO has assigned $200mm in MANA to their Ecosystem Fund to fund development of engaging content in Decentraland. ICE Poker has already proven its ability to deliver value to Decentraland by driving the majority of Decentraland’s daily active and concurrent user growth in 2022. The majority of the Decentral Games treasury is locked in illiquid Decentraland LAND, LP for DG and ICE, and a Polygon Validator node.\n\n**Why $1mm and why 3 months?**\n\n$1mm USD in MANA would provide sufficient rewards over a 3 month period to allow the Decentral Games team to deliver on building, launching, and growing ICE Poker SNG, which will enable the ecosystem to self-sustain following the ending of the rewards.\n\n**From a proposal execution perspective, why should DG distribute the MANA rewards?**\n\nThe DG DAO has already implemented audited smart contracts to make rewards tokens claimable for staked LP on decentral.games, so it makes sense for DG to do this execution. To reiterate, the DG Treasury and Decentral Games will earn 0 MANA. The rewards will go entirely to the community.\n\n**A note from the DG Project Lead and Founder, Miles Anthony:**\n\n\"We’ve had conviction around Decentraland and its role in delivering an interactive 3D frontend for the open metaverse from its inception in 2017. Since then, we’ve purchased 1000+ parcels of LAND and invested millions of dollars to build engaging content to attract and retain over 60% of the platform’s users. This MANA allocation is a stepping stone to assist in stabilizing our in-game economy as we prepare to launch ICE Poker Sit-n-Go tournaments, along with other key initiatives that drive organic demand and utility for ICE and solidify our ecosystem’s long term sustainability. With the support of the Decentraland team and community, we look forward to onboarding the next million users into Decentraland and the nascent metaverse.\"\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8ce58760-dc80-11ec-8ad9-ab7454ba5993)**",

    "body": "> by 0xec1352463a7369d73f74d3ebf85ad524dc3c51b8 (VoxBoards)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nVoxBoards is a project born in Decentraland (late December 2021), created for/with its community. We have been collaborating with many members of the space with the goal of mutual growth and union between users, projects, brands and Decentraland.\nWe created many skateboard related NFTs including 3D models, wearables and assets. We have been organizing and sponsoring several events and contests. During april we tested a small alpha version of the skatepark with a p2e game, running with daily users:\n\nAlpha tests gallery:\n\nhttps://www.behance.net/gallery/144421235/VOXBOARDS-P2E-ALPHA-DECENTRALAND\n\nLinks:\n\n*   https://twitter.com/VoxBoardsNFT\n*   https://twitter.com/Miguel_Amargo\n*   http://discord.gg/pJ38gDuHxG\n\nFeel free to DM Miguel Amargo.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n39,800 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x8FE076264169d72de40e8c60bA8C5D273fC405e1\n\n## Description\n\nWhat will we develop?\n\nVoxBoards HQ at the Meta GamiMall(147,60):\n\n*   Skateshop: HQ's Lobby and shop\n\n*   Skatepark: P2E Game\n\n*   Stage/Gallery: Events and promotion\n\nSkate Shop:\n\nThe HQ lobby, where users will find an assistant, Decentraland wearables and other NFTs to purchase. The wearables on the shop will benefit the players during the P2E. Perks will include power-ups and game avatars(Avatar Swap). This will raise the value of those NFTs, their ownership, the project and Decentraland.\n\nSkatepark P2E:\n\nPlayers will have tokens to collect, obstacules and enemies to avoid, compete for top scores, win prizes, use NFTs and enjoy a skateboarding game in Decentraland.\nSkatepark, characters, avatars and assets can be changed according to events, seasons and tournaments. This will allow other projects to join and give the opportunity for their communtities to experience NFT ownership utility, which will bring more traffic and value to Decentraland simultanously.\nThe player can access the skatepark by teleport from the shop/lobby. Inside the skatepark,the user can log in and play. There will be rounds of 3 minutes to catch a limited amount of tokens, enemies to avoid and diferent levels to unlock.\n\nClub:\n\nA place for events and promotional content, where users can join, hang out and celebrate. NFTs can be displayed and purchased, users can learn more about Decentraland, NFT utility, web3, watch in-game and IRL competitions, interviews, streamings, videos and interact with assets.\nWe will utilize this feature to bring more projects to decentraland and experience the metaverse, by offering a space where they can find their target costumers and give more utility possibilities to their community members and customers.\nThe skatepark and stage assets, characters and gallery can be customized. We are ready to host events, create avatars, wearables, assets and promotional content.\nThe player can access the skatepark by teleport from the shop/lobby or skatepark.\n\nHow will it be sustainable?\n\nOur plan is to have a space where other projects and brands can relate and join, which will bring more users. Creating more wearables for decentraland with game features will bring more value to the NFTs and Decentraland.\nThere are many people interested in skateboarding and we believe this project can expand quickly and bring gamers, IRL skaters, brands, NFT projects and their communuties if done on a bigger scale.\n\nOnce we have the HQ running we can generate income by:\n\n*   Renting space for exposing NFTs and other merch, making them available for purchase\n*   Custom events for clients\n*   Creating/Selling NFTs with game utility\n*   Selling merch(IRL or NFT)\n\nThe funds from DAO would allow us to create improved and sustainble experiences that we can later present to users, clients and collaborators. We plan to work with iconic creators, invest on promoting and bringing more people in, by building a platform with a fun game-play and dynamic supportive enviroment.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nIn order to complete the project we need to build the HQ, design characters and other assets, develop the game structure/mechanics and code using SDK.\n\nSkate shop:\n\n*   SkateShop Model: base model and interior decorations.\n\n*   Assistant Model: character at the store that users can interact for guidance about the HQ .\n\n*   Forge Machine: to forge items and NFTs\n\nSkatepark P2E game:\n\n*   Skatepark model: The base.\n\n*   Skatepark assets: diferent models that we can upload for different levels and challenges in the game.\n\n*   Animated platforms and obstacules: assets to make the gameplay more challenging and appealing.\n\n*   Tokens:  to collect all around the skatepark. They can be used to craft items and NFTs.\n\n*   Game Avatars: We will start with 10 avatars!  10 that can be earned or bought and are associated with wearables (limited stock on both options). The game avatars are NFTs, using the same technology as in the MetaDoge NFT CoinRace (Avatar Swap). The will be specially designed and animated for the game.\n\n*   Assistant: To guide the user..\n\n*   Friends: Skater characters cheering for you and giving you tips when you approach and interact with them\n\n*   Enemies: Security characters who will collide with the players if unavoided and teleport them out of the building. Enemies skating around the park who will collide if unavoided and make player loose tokens.\n\n*   Wearables: The “voxboard bundle 1”(lower body) will provide the utility to enter and play the game. “VoxBoarder”(skin) has 2 representations which will be associated with 2 avatars.  Other existing wearables are going to grant bonus scores in game. We will also create and publish 5 more skater clothing items and 4 more skins to be associated with 8 avatars.\n    Creating total of 9 more wearables instead of other NFTs for the Avatar Swap it's a way to bring back funds to the DAO while giving more value to Decentraland, MANA, and trading.\n\nClub:\n\n*   Stage Model: The base model and interior decorations.\n\n*   Assets: Screen, poap machine, ramps and other skateboarding related assets, for the space to be more fun and interactive.\n\n*   Gallery: Displaying NFTs and other content linked to markets.\n\n*   Assistant: To guide the user and teleport to other area.\n\nBudget:\n\n*   Building HQ base model (design) - $2,100\n*   P2E development  (game mechanics, design and assets) - $3,000\n*   4 skins/8 designs  (design + publishing fees) - $4,400\n*   10 game avatars associated with wearables\\* (design for game +  animations) - $6,600\n*   1 assistant (design +  animations) - $400\n*   2 friendly characters (design + animations) - $400\n*   2 enemy characters (design + animations) - $1000\n*   5 wearables (design + publishing fees) - $5,500\n*   SDK development (setup Grab Coin+Avatar Swap+interactive characters and assets+maintnance and updates) - $10,000\n*   Launch event ( promotion, advertising, hosts and djs) - $4,000\n*   Community management - $2,400\n\n\\*1 of the 10 avatars will be associated with decentraland wearables: \"VoxBoarder\". It will redesigned to be on a skateboarding pose and have game animations (stopped, pushing, riding and jump+trick).\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nMiguel Amargo: Founder/Marketing/Designer/Concept\n\nDOCTORdripp: Designer/Concept\n\nDj TRAXX: DJ/Event Organizer/Social Media\n\nLady Lena: Advertising/Social Media\n\nParagonDCL: Community manager\n\nPartners\n\nMeta Live Studios: Land/SDK\n\nOutsource:\n\nVoxboards team will continue to collaborate with decentraland creators for 3D designs, game development, promotional content, advertisment and will also invest on reaching outside the community for pro skaters, Djs, gaming, crypto and NFT influencers.\n\nThe team members for this project have been working hard on improving decentraland, help and expand the community. We also have the advantage to have both, portuguese and english speakers who can reach, invite and assist a wide range of people.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe VoxBoards main team and collaborators will focus on the community and game and design while our partners will develop SDK. We expect to have the HQ fully ready to launch, with the P2E game, in 6 months.\n\n1st phase: Building the HQ, the assets, the characters, game avatars and new wearables.\n\n2nd phase: Animating characters and assets. Developing gameplay mechanics.\n\n3rd phase: SDK development.\n\n4th phase: HQ tests.\n\n5th phase: Promotion. HQ/P2E Launch event. Wearables and game avatars release. Utilities upgrade.\n\n6th phase: P2E game.Promotion.Contests.Maintenance.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bf1141e0-dc01-11ec-8ad9-ab7454ba5993)**",

Sometimes there are legal implications in projects related to grants (contracts, terms, etc.), so it would be desirable to have some degree of certainty that there is a real person behind it.\n\nTo be clear, a grant for up to 240k USD can be provided and there is no proof of who got it.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nBefore applying for a grant, the beneficiary must validate himself/herself as a person. \"How\" is open for discussion - my suggestion would be to use [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) since it is a crypto-native validation, but it could be some sort of KYC or any other way to accomplish this.\n\n### Implementation\n\nThe DAO should add a validation method when submitting a grant request to verify that the beneficiary is a real person. This way, grant requests that are available for voting will be pre-validated. This should not affect active grants that have been enacted prior to this change, if implemented.\n\n- Yes, implement a crypto-native validation method (i.e. PoH)\n- Yes, implement a traditional validation method (Proof of ID or any other)\n- No, do not validate beneficiaries\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7adc93b0-db77-11ec-8ad9-ab7454ba5993)**",

This is a metaverse game, focused on kids aged 4-8. Our games are designed & developed to make kids stronger with physical movement, smarter by solving maths/English puzzles, and more mindful with stillness and yoga training. Demo - https://youtu.be/h6ghM2g_xJ4\n\nOur husband-wife founders have a track record of bootstrapping world-class award-winning products, learning and launching crowdfunding and successfully making exits.\n\nAshok has 22 years of experience in building innovative tech products and holds an MS in CS and an MBA in IT.\n\nAriane has 20 years of experience in Operations & legal and holds masters in Economics and Law from Cambridge University.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x9Be3C19f54EDd2170830c6C12E3BA0A2658be80B\n\n## Description\n\nChildren aged 4-8 years old spend an average of 10 hours sleeping, 8 hours a day in learning, 3 hours in entertainment and only 2 hours in physical activity.\n\nWe are combining learning, entertainment & physical activity into AR education mini games to help children grow smarter, stronger and more mindful.\n\nSuperKidz is the world’s first Move-to-Earn and Learn-to-Earn NFT game which makes it fun and rewarding for kids to learn, get active and become more mindful.  Built on (TBD) Solana/Avalanche/Ethereum, SuperKidz integrates your kid’s daily activity in real life with blockchain Play-to-Earn economics so you can turn your kid’s real-life actions into expansive gameplay and earn crypto while doing it.\n\nWe started our research 2 years ago when iPhone 11 demonstrated realtime body tracing and 3D avatar rendering in real time. We developed our proof of concept in Unity 2019 and noticed several challenges in terms of user experience and performance.\n\nWe tested our prototype at home with our kids and found that VR was too dangerous for kids because they kept bumping into things. Any external hardware was also a challenge because parents weren't willing to buy or setup.

Id like to propose a poll to see how many people would like to see names be minted at a equivalency of 100 usd in mana. Why 100 usd you ask? My answer is a name gives 100 vp so I pegged it to 1 for one with its vote power in return.  The prices seem to go up and down and i can remember paying 300+ usd for names. I think pegging a stable amount would help maybe bring in more people willing to buy their names. Also give people a target for acquisitioning.  This could also be changed later to a different cost but I think due to the 100 vp this is a fair market value. Would love to hear community thoughts and opinion's. Also remember names are tradable nft's and usable as sub domains.\n\n- Change to 100 usd equivalent in mana\n- Keep price's same\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=78c618b0-d967-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)**",

    "title": "Wearables Working Group: Attach VP to Limited # of L1 Wearable Collections",
    "body": "> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[L1 Ethereum Wearables Voting Power Allocation Proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=02129b80-d143-11eb-9861-ebb8fcfd58d2)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal calls for attaching voting power to the original six official DCL L1 wearable collections, released in 2019. This includes :1) Community Contest; 2) DCL Launch; 3) Exclusive Masks; 4) Halloween 2019; 5) MCH Collection; & 6) Xmas 2019.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe question of attaching Voting Power (VP) to wearables is an important issue to members of the Decentraland community. To date, there have been at least four (4) proposals surrounding this topic. All of those that passed were approved before the introduction of the three-stage binding governance proposal process. The hope is that the solution proposed herein meets the demands of wearable stakeholders, and is both accepted by other stakeholders and viewed as technically feasible due to its limited application to only the six (6) first and official Decentraland wearables collections.\n\nPreviously passed proposals include:\n\n*   On June 14, 2022, a non-binding poll to “Get voting power for your current L1 wearables and strengthen the wider community DAO participation” passed with 1,442,355 VP (76%/52 votes) in favor; 437,946 VP (24%/10 votes) against. This poll established initial community support for attaching VP to L1 wearables, without detailing specific implementation pathways or a detailed impact assessment. It additionally called for a subsequent proposal to determine a tiered VP allocation system based on the rarity category of items.\n\n*   On June 26, 2022, a subsequent non-binding poll for “L1 Ethereum Wearables Voting Power Allocation Proposal” passed, with 2,920,657 VP (96%/55 votes) in favor; 146,49 VP (4%/9 votes) against. This poll did not contain any specific information on implementation pathways or impact assessment, however, it built on the previous poll, calling for distribution of VP to L1 wearables based on rarity level along the following parameters:\n\nMythic: 1000 VP\n\nLegendary: 100 VP\n\nEpic: 10 VP\n\nRare: 5 VP\n\nUncommon: 1 VP\n\nThe argument against attaching VP to L1 wearables has been primarily technical, with both the DAO Committee and other knowledgeable community members pointing to three primary challenges: First, the broad technical scale of attaching VP to wearables that are distributed across X# collections, all of which are held on separate contracts. Second, is the arbitrary distinction between L1 and L2 wearables, particularly given future conflicts that could arise due to emerging technologies that reduce L1 transaction fees (i.e. zK roll-ups and sidechains) or enable easy bridging of assets between L1 and L2. Third, is the fact that L1 wearables outside of the collections officially sold by DCL involved p2p transactions in which no MANA was burned from the ecosystem, and would effectively be creating double VP for these transactions.\n\nThis proposal aims to account for all of these critiques. After conducting an in depth analysis of L1 wearables, total/active voting power, and other VP-allocating assets - including LAND, MANA and Names - we have determined that while a blanket application of VP to all L1 wearables is impractical and difficult to justify, limiting the application to the OG6 official collections is justifiable quantitatively - accounting for nearly 70% of all L1 wearables; technically - being limited to only six (6) wearable collections; and qualitatively - linking VP to official DCL collections, with the amount of VP reasonably comparable to the amount of MANA spent/burned to purchase the one OG collection (Halloween 2019) that was officially sold (rather than given away) to the community.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal seeks to resolve the issue of wearables VP, which has been a point of contention since passage of the first non-binding poll in June 2022. It aims to provide an implementation pathway that distributes wearable VP in as equitable a way as possible, while mitigating technical blockers. It further fulfills a demand that was made by the community with a relatively strong level of support, equating to nearly 20% of historical VP, however, was not enacted by the DAO committee because there was no clear implementation pathway.\n\nWhile there was no initial promise of VP with purchase of early L1 wearables, assets from the Halloween 2019 collection remain the only officially-sponsored asset in which MANA was spent by community members, burned by the Foundation, and is not associated with any form of VP. The problem with some past solutions proposed by wearable stakeholders to attach VP to ALL L1 wearables is that, a) it is incredibly arduous to implement, particularly when considering distributing VP by rarity of each collection; b) it is somewhat arbitrary in that there is no precedent for such a VP-generating act; and c) In the majority of cases it would in fact be creating double VP in that wearables were purchased in a p2p transaction in which no MANA was burned, so the seller would have received MANA equating to VP and the buyer a wearable equating to VP. As a result of the above, an all encompassing L1 solution is technically impractical and both quantitatively and qualitatively difficult to justify.\n\nThe Halloween 2019 collection, however, was the first wearable collection after the Exclusive Masks beta, and the only collection partially sold by the Decentraland Foundation, raising 1,077,320 MANA in sales. Although subsequent collections in the 2019 wearable offerings were distributed for free or as a reward, this spent MANA, which was removed from the ecosystem, has not received any democratic utility. By attaching VP to these “initial offering” wearable collections (and only to these initial six), which are the foundation of the robust wearables market we see today, this proposal aims to assert wearables as an essential asset class - similar to MANA, LAND, and Names.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAttach voting power, distributed by rarity to the six (6) official Decentraland wearable collections released in 2019. This includes:\n\n1.  Community Contest\n2.  DCL Launch\n3.  Exclusive Masks\n4.  Halloween 2019\n5.  MCH Collection\n6.  Xmas 2019\n\n*   There are 48,620 total wearables in these six collections, spread across 7,583 wallets. This equates to nearly 70% of the 71,082 total L1 wearables, which are spread across 10,442 unique wallets.\n\nVP will be distributed according to rarity as follows:\n\n*   Mythic: 1000 VP\n\n*   Legendary: 100 VP\n\n*   Epic: 10 VP\n\n*   Rare: 5 VP\n\n*   Uncommon: 1 VP\n\n*   There are 644 mythic across 189 unique wallets; 4,249 Legendary across 827 unique wallets; 17,382 Epic across 4,820 unique wallets; and 24,713 rares across 4,126 unique wallets.\n\nIn total this will create **1,796,691 VP**. This equates to less than 10% of the historically active VP in the DAO, and is less than 2x the amount of MANA spent (and burned) by community members to purchase Halloween 2019 wearables from the Decentraland Foundation.\n\n\\[Impacts & Implementation pathways are available for discussion on the Forum (https://forum.decentraland.org/t/draft-cumulative-layer-1-wearables-vp-proposal/11423), and will be included in the final Binding Governance Proposal]\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese six (6) original wearable collections from 2019 are the final group of initial offering assets that have no associated VP. Other assets in this category include MANA, LAND and Names. What unites these assets are the fact that they are tied to either the core Decentraland smart contracts, or were linked to a foundation-led asset sale in which MANA was burned or the assets were distributed freely to early project adopters.\n\nVoting in favor of this proposal is meant to put a close to the question of creating additional voting power assets in the future. This final section of the proposal should be referred to if there are further attempts to use past precedent as an argue for extending VP to additional asset sets or categories.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ee6b1b90-d7fc-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)**",

    "body": "> by 0x521b0fef9cdcf250abaf8e7bc798cbe13fa98692 (Kyllian)\n\nDecentral Games ICE Poker is the first metaverse-native poker game. ICE Poker is a free play-and-earn poker game that gives players economic freedom through self-custody and delegation of wearables.\n\nIn addition to poker, Decentral Games venues also host daily virtual events such as live music, artist showcases, NFT drop parties, comedy shows, and more. DG has experienced significant growth since launching ICE Poker in fall 2021 and have onboard thousands of people into Decentraland.\n\nDecentral Games is continuing to grow the ecosystem by launching competitive tournaments and metaverse advertising in our venues. We’re targeting July to launch sit-and-go tournaments which will increase product stickiness and improve our scaling to onboard the next larger wave of users into Decentraland. The stats today:\n\n*   12 live Decentraland venues\n*   1,007 parcels of Decentraland LAND\n*   8,000+ daily active players\n*   40,000+ weekly visitors across all venues\n\nAll told, Decentral Games Venue visitors and ICE Poker players account for ~60% of Decentraland’s weekly active users!\n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nAssign $1M USD worth of MANA to provide rewards for the ICE-USDC liquidity pool on QuickSwap. MANA rewards will be distributed over 3 months to those that stake USDC-ICE LP bootstrap the pool. This is temporary (3-month) support while sit-and-go tournaments are developed, launch (July), and ramp up.\n\nNote 1: If the final proposal passes, within 10 days following the proposal passing, $1M USD of MANA would be sent to dgtreasury.eth to distribute to folks staking the LP, but no MANA would be retained/kept by the DG DAO. Specifically, 0 MANA will be assigned to the LP that the DG DAO itself provides to the pool (DG DAO won't stake LP), so all rewards will go to these Decentraland community members staking LP.\n\nNote 2: While this request would exceed the grant threshold, these are liquidity incentives for an LP pool on QuickSwap rather than a grant to the DG DAO (which would earn 0 MANA).\n\n### RATIONALE\n\nThe DCL DAO assigning  MANA to bolster ICE-USDC liquidity (& $ICE price) would contribute to maintaining Decentraland's DAU. As mentioned in the proposal section, this would be temporary support for the pool (3 months).\n\nMoreover, most ICE holders are not MANA holders and this would help correct for the imbalance that most users of Decentraland today are Decentral Games event participants and ICE Poker players that do not hold MANA; namely, this would be an avenue to welcome them into the DCL DAO as well.\n\nThe DG DAO has already implemented audited smart contracts to make rewards tokens claimable for staked LP, so it makes sense for DG to do this execution rather than Decentraland.\n\n(Submitted on behalf of DecentralGames)\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ece9b3e0-d7c9-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)**",

    "title": "Continued Development and Expansion of Decentraland VR Client",
    "body": "> by 0x9a739c2e212754c3d8432cb717dc9437e5b3dfae (Sean#dfae)\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe team behind Decentraland’s DAO-funded VR client is seeking a grant for continued development and expansion of VR support for Decentraland. The proposed scope in this grant expands the current VR client to include native Android support so that devices such as the Quest 2 can be supported without the need to connect to a PC. We also seek to enhance the VR client to bring more functionality by converting more keyboard/mouse interactions to VR controller interactions and implementing a unique hand/controller-based UI that is more suitable for a VR client. The team is honored to be considered for a DAO grant for the continued development of Decentraland VR.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x9A739c2e212754c3d8432CB717dC9437e5b3Dfae\n\n## Description\n\n### Background\n\nIn December 2021, the community voted to approve a Decentraland DAO [grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=088fc210-5e26-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) that launched one of the first significant VR efforts to the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nRead the previous grant proposal [here.](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=088fc210-5e26-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)\n\nThat grant proposal covered both the development of Byldr to support creating content for Decentraland as well as a viewer for users to experience Decentraland in VR.\nThat grant proposal specified that the VR viewer was not the primary focus of the grant, and the original intention of the proposed approach was to integrate the viewer with Byldr. However, after starting work on the project, the team quickly realized that Decentraland would better benefit from a separate, open source VR client and that the addition of a VR client would be an enormous benefit for Decentraland. Therefore, the team spent significantly more effort on the VR client portion of that grant than originally planned for and have since received remarkably positive engagement and enthusiasm from the Decentraland community.\n\nUnder the previous grant, the team was able to successfully port Decentraland to run on PC-based VR devices (SteamVR headsets, Quest via PC link, Windows Mixed Reality, and other PCVR headsets) and began to convert most 2D UI elements and interacts to operate in 3D space within the VR experience.\n\n### Decentraland VR support to run natively on Quest\n\nThe team spent significant time investigating porting Decentraland VR to run natively on android in order to support devices such as the Quest 2, without the need to connect the headset to a PC. After much investigation and attempts, the team learned that the Decentraland architecture would require significant effort to get the Decentraland kernel (the core component of Decentraland that handles scene state) to run on an Android-based VR headset. The team proposes to tackle this challenge in this grant in order to build a native Quest Decentraland VR client. This will significantly reduce the difficulty and cost of accessing Decentraland VR and make Decentraland a true, portable immersive experience for the masses.\n\n### Continued development of Decentraland VR\n\nDecentraland’s in-world interactions are primarily built around PC-based inputs such as keyboard and mouse. While the team has ported many key interactions to work with VR controllers during the previous grant, there are still many in-world elements, UI, and interactions that work only with keyboard/mouse input. The team proposes to continue development on this to bring Decentraland VR up to parity with the desktop/web clients so that VR users can do anything that PC users can do.\n\nThe team seeks to build upon the previous VR client effort by submitting the current grant proposal, which is fully dedicated to the Decentraland VR client. The team is honored to be considered for a DAO grant for the continued development of Decentraland VR. We are excited to be part of Decentraland’s journey toward making the metaverse a fun, immersive and vibrant economy that increases accessibility and financial opportunities to Decentraland citizens all over the world! We would like to thank everyone in the Decentraland community for your support and the integral part you play in building the XR future for all generations to come.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Decentraland Native Quest Support.\n\nThe team previously explored multiple pathways for native Quest support. Although the team was able to successfully achieve a Quest port of the Decentraland renderer, without the kernel no content would load into the scene. A full port to run Decentraland VR on Quest would require that the Decentraland kernel is also ported. Pathways explored included running the kernel on a PC and connecting it to the headset, running the kernel remotely, and running the kernel on the VR headset. The preferred pathway is for the kernel to run directly on the headset so that a PC is not required. The team’s proposed approach is to launch the kernel within an in-app container or to launch a backgrounded on-device server. Once the kernel is running, then the Decentraland renderer will be able to load content from the kernel and provide a functional experience. The team will then investigate and tackle any potential android-related incompatibilities with Decentraland, providing robust Quest support. The team intends to work closely with Decentraland foundation for publishing the Decentraland VR application and for any kernel- and renderer-related core contributions as part of the port to Android.\n\n### Decentraland VR continued development and improvements.\n\nAs mentioned in the description, the team has ported many key interactions to work with VR controllers during the previous grant, however there are still many in-world elements, UI, and interactions that work only with keyboard/mouse input. The team proposes to continue development on this to bring Decentraland VR up to parity with the desktop/web clients so that VR users can do anything that PC users can do. For any UI elements that only appear on the 2D PC screen, such as dialogue text and some pop-up messages, the team will bring these items into 3D space, and where appropriate, ensure that they are located in the context of their associated content (e.g., a pop-up text will appear next to the item that spawned the pop-up.) There are also some in-world games and custom experiences that rely on keyboard input (e.g., “press E” or “Press F” to do to shoot a ball.) Although it will be difficult to universally convert all custom keyboard functionality to VR – the team proposes to standardize inputs to VR controller buttons and investigate any logic that can map keyboard keys to controller buttons, depending on context. The team will also implement a unique UI that is more suitable for a VR client. This UI will involve being attached to one or both controllers, allowing for convenient, nested menu options that are easily accessible within VR.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe items outlined in this grant proposal will be managed and completed by the Ong Innovations team and our associated partners.\n\n### The team comprises\n\nSean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n\nVarun Siddaraju (Technical project manager and senior developer)\n\nClint Campbell (XR developer)\n\nPaul Gumpert (XR developer)\n\nClinton Reddie (XR Developer and Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nVeeRuby Technologies (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nAppVolks LLC (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\nXR Dev Studio (Ong Innovations development partner)\n\n### Additional information on our company, team members, and partners can be found in the links below\n\nhttps://www.xrdevstudio.com/\n\nhttps://www.veeruby.com/\n\nhttps://www.appvolks.com/\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### Progress Updates\n\nThe team will report progress to the Decentraland community on an ongoing basis and will monitor the project's forum and DAO Discord channel closely for questions or to provide updates as needed. The team will summarize major activities formally in a monthly report.\n\n### Timeline\n\nThe proposed project will be completed within 6 months based on the following milestones and timeline:\n\n#### June-July 2022\n\nDeep dive into kernel port for native Quest support. Bring all on-screen UI elements into in-headset. Initial development of custom VR menu UI for Decentraland.\n\n#### August-September 2022\n\nContinued work on kernel port and preliminary beta testing of native Quest VR support by community members. Community beta testing / iteration of custom VR UI. Work towards converting any missing keyboard/mouse interactions to VR controller interactions.\n\n#### October-November 2022\n\nContinued beta tests expected. Testing, bug fixes, user feedback collection. Full release of Decentraland VR for Quest with custom VR UI.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8fe0e0a0-d62b-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)**",

From its inception, it has grown into a fully-featured product development team working in an open and agile way, **focused on improving the capabilities of the main governance platform of the Decentraland DAO**, the Governance dApp, and its ecosystem.\n\nTo see a detailed breakdown of the initiatives it has achieved in the last 4 1/2 months (There are 1 1/2 months left in the current Grant period) read [this](https://www.notion.so/dcl-dao/DAO-Governance-Squad-2H2022-Renewal-Proposal-044b3a5f2a70477ea05e0ebf4cb77833#ada722bad1ba4ad4a3e02e62c5e4feb4).\n\nCheck the changelog [here](https://www.notion.so/dcl-dao/Decentraland-Governance-dApp-Release-Notes-dc15030c43f541fbbb274be49c1e0dac) and the thread with monthly updates [here](https://dcl-dao.notion.site/Decentraland-Governance-dApp-Release-Notes-dc15030c43f541fbbb274be49c1e0dac).\n\nCheck the Transparency Dashboard to see some key metrics of the DAO operations [here](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/fca13118-c18d-4e68-9582-ad46d2dd5ce9/page/p_ggos5z86rc).\n\n**This Grant proposal aims to continue this development path taking into account the needs of the Decentraland DAO community and its multiple stakeholders for the upcoming 6 months**. A detailed view of the objectives can be found in the Roadmap and Milestones section of this proposal.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis grant will set up a budget to run this team for the next 6 months. This grant could be extended upon a further decision of the DAO if the grant succeeds in its objectives. \\\n\\\nThe DAO Governance Squad has been set up as a Panama sole-purpose, Non-for-Profit Foundation. The costs associated with maintaining the foundation are included in this Grant. The same Conditions of the Grant detailed in the [previous proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) still apply.\n\nThe grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stable coins assigned to a 2-out-of-3 signatures [wallet](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x3bf800b6F5c987b3738432068f789b7d131F1698/transactions/history). The key holders are Gino Cingolani, Yemel Jardi, and Manuel Araoz in their respective capacities as Squad Lead, DAO Committee Member, and Trusted Community Member.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe proposed team of the DAO Governance Squad is the following:\n\n*   Senior Product Manager - Gino Cingolani ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginocingolani), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ginocingolani))\n*   Senior Product Designer - Juani Ruiz Echazu ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heyimjuani/), [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/juani), [Github](https://github.com/heyimjuani))\n*   Senior Full Stack Developer - JP Arnaudo ([Github](https://github.com/jparnaudo), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jparnaudo/))\n*   Senior Full Stack Developer - Andy Espagnolo ([Github](https://github.com/andyesp), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andyespagnolo/))\n*   Junior Full Stack Developer - Nico Comerci ([Github](https://github.com/ncomerci), [Linkedin](https://ar.linkedin.com/in/ncomerci))\n\nNote: This is the current team structure, we're not planning to add new team members in this grant period.\n\nTime Investment: ~480 monthly hours or ~120 weekly hours. (**33% workload increase from previous grant project**)\n\nBudget: $28,660 USD per month or a grand total of $172,000 USD.\n\nThis budget includes:\n\n*   Team salaries: $146,000\n*   Operational expenses: $6,000\n*   Travel and accommodation expenses for an industry-related event attendance: $20,000\n\nFinancial report of the previous Grant period detailed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17uwRIFtrEmYNFJ4iZs3mYpELXFAaaXrLmdMXlpRthpo/edit#gid=1332523020).\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur north star remains the same: **We will continue improving the mechanisms for which the DAO Community engages with the governance process to lower the friction and increase the quality and frequency of contributions to the DAO**. Those contributions could take the form of participation in proposal voting and discussion, engagement with grants or ongoing projects, and discussions in working groups or public spaces such as Discord and the Forum.\n\nThe work planned ahead is organized on three main themes (Engagement, Community Building, and Development Experience) that will guide the development journey. We are maintaining the Engagement theme from our previous Grant and proposing two new ones.\n\n**To see a detailed breakdown of proposed initiatives please click [here](https://www.notion.so/dcl-dao/DAO-Governance-Squad-2H2022-Renewal-Proposal-044b3a5f2a70477ea05e0ebf4cb77833#067c72c55ff644e19e60c07c5919cdd0)**.  Roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback and needs.\n\nThe team will follow [agile development practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) to ensure a lean implementation of DAO governance requirements and continuous improvement of such features. **The team will provide updates to the community, gather feedback and answer questions at the open DAO Town Hall meetings and over Discord.**\n\nThe work the team is currently doing is visible on this [Github Project](https://github.com/orgs/decentraland/projects/24/views/1).\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=524fb800-d532-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)**",

    "title": "Keep Polygon transactions free",
    "body": "> by 0x87956abc4078a0cc3b89b419928b857b8af826ed (Nacho)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Keep Polygon transactions free](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=3e828730-caf6-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe DAO will subside polygon transactions for Decentraland users\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe DAO will fund the Gas tank for Polygon meta transactions in order to keep a better UX and lowers the barrier of entry for publishing, listing, bidding, and buying wearables in exchange for MANA between others.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis is a follow-up from this [past proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7af34c90-5d1e-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7), where a Grant was given by the DAO to keep Polygon transactions in Decentraland free for all its users. Free transactions mean that the Decentraland users do not have to pay gas for each meta-transaction (in Polygon) they perform while using the product. This leads to a better UX and lowers the barrier of entry since we subsidize the costs and reduce the number of interactions with the wallet for day-to-day activities such as listing and buying wearables, placing bids and accepting them, publishing wearables, etcetera.\n\nDecentraland has been using **[Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/)**, a meta-transaction relayer, to provide free transactions in Polygon since the **[launch](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor)** of user-generated collections in Polygon on June 1, 2021.\n\nThe way Biconomy works is by providing us with a personalized **gas tank that we need to fill to cover the cost of the meta-transactions.**\n\n\n## Specification\n\nUp until now, the gas tank was filled with funds coming from different Grants asked from the community and provided by the DAO. This time, the proposal is to **establish an ongoing mechanism to maintain the gas tank full over time.** As the community is growing and more transactions are taking place, it’s important to keep it full in favor of the whole community and for the sake of Decentraland’s growth.\n\nIt’s important to consider that there is an **economically sustainable model behind this proposal**, the fees extracted from transactions in the Marketplace, Builder, and other dApps are the second most important source of income for the DAO. The numbers are public and can be seen in the Income dashboard on the [Transparency](https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/) section in the DAO Governance dApp.\n\nThe Decentraland Marketplace generates around USD 250,000 per month in profits, this income would cover the cost of the meta-transactions and the flywheel could keep spinning: better UX > > more transactions > more income for the DAO. If the DAO stops covering the costs of the meta-transactions, then users will need to pay for them to perform almost any action in the dApps, this would discourage people from uploading wearables, bidding, and making transactions in the marketplace. In the end, it would result in less income for the DAO that could be redistributed in the form of Grants and a worse user experience for the Decentraland community.\n\nNote that to avoid potential attacks or abuse situations where the gas tank could be emptied, claiming/buying wearables for free or less than 1 MANA is not going to be covered by the meta-transactions model.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThis will impact the whole Decentraland users\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe DAO will need to fund the Biconomy Gas Tank\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf this proposal closes and the result is \"YES\",  the DAO Committee will be in charge of swapping Mana for Matic to fill the gas tank in the Biconomy platform, making sure it has always enough Matic to support free meta-transactions in Decentraland.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=548aa0c0-d51a-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)**",

    "title": "Build SkillProfile for Metaverse - Skills owned by the person, not the employer",
    "body": "> by 0xecaf4d16c3579f92ef441ac6ae35249fcecaabf1 (kronoschick#abf1)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nKnowledge, Skills, Attitudes and Competencies are attributes of people and they should be owned, managed, controlled by the people who grow and develop these attributes. SkillProfile is currently a mobile app that lets people gather feedback from friends and colleagues and puts it together in a SkillProfile that can be shared (or not) by the individual requesting. Like a 360 review but for everyone and controlled by the individual, not the employer.\nWe are submitting this grant to build out an experience to help people in the metaverse build their SkillProfile(s) and use it to gain employment (or just have fun) in Decentraland. We are 3 founders (2 in Silicon valley, 1 on US East coast) with deep experience in tech. www.skillprofile.com\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n20,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xEcAF4d16c3579F92eF441AC6aE35249FcEcAaBf1\n\n## Description\n\nThe metaverse world is just beginning and we believe it will change the way people interact. Skillprofile is the brainchild of Kris Lundin, a woman with deep experience in tech as a product leader for startups and large companies. She is joined by Owen Davis a technologist with deep experience building world class software with over 20 years experience and a passion for new technology. Our COO is Noah Jacobson who is a trained lawyer and operational leader. We've built our mobile app and just launched it this year in the Play and App stores and are gaining traction.\\\nSkillProfile lets people create profiles made up of Knowledge, Skills, Attitudes and Competencies and then request anonymous feedback from their friends and colleagues and see the aggregate rating and comments.\nIt's like a 360 review but controlled by the individual and not limited to traditional employment or executives. It democratizes HR and Talent practices and puts it in the hands and control of the people themselves. It can also be extended to non-traditional employment and even game profiles (are you a good teammate, do you tilt under pressure, etc).\n\nWe would like to bring Skillprofile to the metaverse by creating a skills-based game and allows people to own their own profiles and then develop a place where people can share those profiles with others and expand the way we communicate and find employment or other like minded individuals in the metaverse.\n\nOur second phase would include the build out of a job board where users can share their SkillProfiles and potential employers or teammates can identify individuals who might be good candidates to either participate in their games, act as hosts, or do other necessary tasks to maintain the metaverse. Of course as Decentraland develops the way in which people interact could evolve in new and exciting ways so I hesitate to call it traditional employment but more like a place people can learn about themselves, develop their attributes and use them to create a life and experience they want.\nI believe we can create a place where what you bring to the table is verified, owned and is uniquely the individual and where others can find those people.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nSkillProfile the app is already live in the Google Play store and the Apple App store and can be downloaded. It is fully functional, built on React Native uses a Google Cloud Platform back end based on Firebase. We would be extending the SkillProfile to be stored on the Ethereum blockchain and to be able to be shared with others in Decentraland. We will also be creating an interactive experience or game to engage new users to claim theirs and start gathering feedback from people they interact with both in game and out.\nWith the grant we would purchase some land in Decentraland to create our scene and will be using Unity to develop an in world game/destination where participants can play, learn about skills. We have not fully fleshed out the game mechanics yet but we know it will relate to Knowlege Skills, Attitudes and Competencies and will help users flesh out their own personal Skillprofiles. Below is a walkthrough of the app we created already and is the foundation for our idea.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSz1ZYKvqvY\\&t=5s\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nKristin Lundin, CEO SkillProfile - She is a product leader with about 20 years of experience in HR and  Martech industries. She has built world class software her entire career at companies like Kronos, Fidelity Investments and Salary.com and most recently serves as the VP of Platform Solutions at TapClicks (a leading martech company in silicon valley)\nOwen Davis, CTO SkillProfile - He is a technology leader with over 20 years of experience in Financial Services, Martech and others. He is a full architect with several full enterprise class projects. He also has experience leading development teams to deliver great projects. He is currently the Senior Director of Software Engineering at TapClicks as well.\nWe have several contractor relationships for UI/UX  and other development support both onshore US and offshore for React and Unity.\nNoah Jacobson - COO SkillProfile - He is a business leader who has helped create several startups and he helps us to navigate the business landscape and negotiate contracts and helps with finance, legal and funding discussions.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nIf we are funded - we will begin the process of purchasing the required land and development of the specifications needed to build out the experience.\nMilestones would be:\n\na) Land is purchased for SkillProfile (due 2 weeks after funding)\nb) Game Design brief  (due 2 weeks after funding)\nc) Ethereum Blockchain integration with existing Skillprofile infrastructure (due at 1 month cliff) - Share individual's SP to Blockchain wallet and necessary APIs for management of transactions\nd) Scene completion with game/interaction wireframe/prototype due at 1 month cliff. User testing and iteration will begin\ne) Game/interaction full launch at 3 months\nf) Skill Sharing and Search launched at 6 months with users able to find others (if people make their profiles public) to connect and share.\n\nFor instance: if a person wants to play a multiplayer game that needs teamwork they could create a listing for someone with the required skills and find people who have chosen to share their profile.  Same - if someone needs a volunteer coordinator for a new casino in Decentraland they could find someone who has the knowledge of running a casino along with the needed organizational skills and customer service attitudes.\nIf a person needed a creative designer to skin a new NFT for their next in-world concert launch  they could post/find a designer to work with them on the project, all from within Decentraland.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=daa9b1c0-d4eb-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)**",

    "body": "> by 0x9381caa558f19a821a2360c59fdf3db60c09ff52 (JTV)\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nExodus: Goodbye World is a metaverse RPG set in Decentraland and being actively developed on a 7x7 estate at 126,44. The core Exodus team, not including volunteers, includes 4 Software Engineers and 4 3D-Desigers working under the leadership of the JTV Development team. We create fun and interactive content to Decentraland so that it can continue growing its player base. The team provides in-game content which has totaled countless playthroughs and thousands of wearable rewards at the JTVHQ venue. As the team builds more interactive content at the Exodus estate, it will need to expand and provide support to its developers. This grant makes a first step towards a much larger goal and ultimately to partner with and give back to Decentraland.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x5117571b0BEc00372CE00870ad8E523C704a78b7\n\n## Description\n\nExodus is a metaverse role-playing game built by childhood friends who met online playing MMORPGs. Every day, MMORPGs bring together millions of people who form strong bonds, communities, and entire economies. Out of a shared passion with cryptocurrencies and MMORPGs, Exodus was born with the goal of making these communities and economies into real, consensus driven assets.\n\nThe name Exodus symbolizes a journey away from the online games we played and cherished as children and towards a new era where crypto assets allow gamers to create real value out of their playtime. We believe that time spent gaming is valuable and want Exodus to realize that belief. Exodus is themed around the concept of moving on from old ways of life and towards a better and more prosperous future. The character will begin in the medieval period and discover new resources, materials, tools, creatures, and questlines. Players will be able to play either passively or actively and work towards special items which will be represented as on-chain assets. The ultimate vision of Exodus is to have a full-fledged blockchain economy capable of providing opportunities to players of all types.\n\nThe JTV team has always focused on educational outreach when onboarding new users. As such, it has grown out of a mutual love for learning and having fun at the same time. The team has volunteered countless hours towards providing Decentraland content and will continue to grow to expand this outreach. JTV embodies this vision and has become a true goodwill of the Decentraland space. With Exodus, the JTV Development team aims to bring thousands of people to Decentraland to have engaging metaverse experiences.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTeam & Experience:\n\nJTV Development is led by none other than JTV, a prominent Decentraland streamer and influencer. JTV streams multiple times a week to onboard new users and share his metaverse experience. Through his promotions and community events, he has distributed tens of thousands of wearables and provided a ‘first wearable’ to thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people. JTV has inspired many Decentraland content creators through his goodwill and general want to better himself and his community. In the opinion of the grant writer (not JTV) – JTV deserves the entirety of this grant, though his intention is to support his team and community through the massive task of building Exodus.\n\nThe JTV Engineers include 3 professional software engineers, 1 software intern, and 4 professional designers/artists. This group provides experience in blockchain development, backend engineering, front-end user experience, 3D designs/animations, web-design, and story-writing. If there was a team with the dedication to achieve the vision of Exodus, this is that team. In fact, the team has already volunteered their time towards creating engaging content like the popular JTV Easter egg hunt and scavenger hunts. Despite this grant’s pending status, the team has eagerly begun full-stack development of Exodus.\n\nAs the Exodus project grows, the JTV team intends to provide new metaverse opportunities to design and software interns. We believe that this fits well with the teams focus on educational content and its theme of giving back to the community. This fits well with the mission of Decentraland to empower its players and to provide opportunities to those who seek them.\n\nRevenue sources:\n\nMemberships\n\nAd space\n\nCosmetic NFTs\n\nBackend services\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nSocials:\n\ntwitch.tv/j_t_v\n\nTwitter @JTV\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\ndiscord.gg/jtv\n\nSite for beta signups. Our main site is currently under development.\nexodusgbw.io\n\nThe JTV Development team consists of 4 Engineers, 4 Designers and various volunteers. We intend to add multiple interns (at least 5 interns split between Engineering and Design) to add to this team.\n\nAllocation of Funds:\n\nFunding will be divided into Engineering, Design, Marketing, and miscellaneous expenses like music, story writing, and server upkeep. Please understand, these values are approximate and may change depending on need. Engineering and design will include funds purposed towards hiring interns. The funding will be divided approximately into the following amounts:\n\nEngineering - $125,000\n\nDesign – $75,000\n\nMarketing - $25,000\n\nMiscellaneous - $15,000\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe primary release of Exodus will occur over a 6-month period with 3 phases: pre-beta, public-beta, and public release. The pre-beta phase will consist of a gradual release of gathering and crafting activities (woodchopping, fishing, mining, forging, cooking, scavenging), quests, and monster-hunting activities. Once fully rolled out, Exodus will transition into a public-beta purposed towards testing the game and preparing for public launch. Exodus intends to officially launch in January 2023.\n\nWe emphasize, the true roadmap of Exodus extends much further than the 6-month period of this grant. Our team intends to deliver a return of value to Decentraland for the long-term future. After public release, Exodus will continue to focus on attracting new players to Decentraland and building fresh content. Blockchain integration like wearables will be key features of Exodus, and will be continually developed for the game.\n\nWe believe that all grant recipients should strive to return the value of their grant plus some. As such, Exodus intends to contribute 5% of all revenue back to the DAO up to a total value of 300,000 USD. This is a small amount to offer in return for the critical support that the DAO would be providing with this grant and the team intends to deliver this. If successful, not only will this provide a return on the investment that the DAO makes with the grant, but it will also attract thousands of new players to Decentraland who can consume other metaverse content.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=74b8b1c0-d40c-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)**",

We will integrate our community into Decentraland through this lounge.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xd41308f50858Da2b7cc641e493fbddf34775393A\n\n## Description\n\nUpon approval of the grant, we would be able to purchase a plot of land (1x1) to host community events and further integrate our community with the Decentraland metaverse. We have feature where users would be able to mint our NFTs from the scene in Decentraland, as well as link our wearables that are already approved. We have a parkour course that will be constantly updated and maintained for users to earn POAPs or wearables in the future. We want to connect with already established brands and grow the community through a positive environment.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe scene has already been built using the Decentraland builder and SDK. We use a program like Visual Code Studio to write the SDK and manage/maintain the script for the events. If the grant is approved, we will acquire the land via a purchase on OpenSea and begin deploying the scene. We have a banner for the Events page as well as a street team to work on promoting events and the scene. All we really need to get this going is the funding for the land.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nRyan Guthrie - Co Creator of Smvsh Friends NFT and leading Decentraland Scene builder. Built the lounge as well as other 3D assets used to import onto the scene. Our metaverse architect.\n\nJoseph Ortega - Lead Developer of Smvsh Friends and Co Creator. Back-end AND front-end dev and support for the technical side of things such as the SDK.\n\nSpecimen XIII - Parkour course creator and enthusiast. Prior experience building in Decentraland for Bored Vibes. Part of the street team to promote events and bring community together.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur project has already launched and we have already started growing our community substantially. We have quite a few members that are very into the metaverse side of web3 and spend quite some time in Decentraland as well as other virtual worlds like VRChat and The Sandbox.\n\nOur goal is to acquire at least a 1x1 plot of land where we can house our Smvsh Friends lounge, showcase our NFTs, and host events for the community to enjoy and get to know some awesome positive and influential people in our network.\n\nThe lounge is already built, all we are waiting on is funding for the land. Originally we planned on buying land at 50% mint-out with our project, but with the way things are progressing, we wanted to acquire land as fast as possible.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=08d6b380-d3c1-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0)**",

The goal of the project is to guarantee the effectiveness of the Grants Program, holding grantees accountable for their projects, and signaling to the DAO if a vesting contract needs to be revoked.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n84,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x658497d7681e4Fb18C65AbD5Ce066A1e3082c1e5\n\n## Description\n\nThe  [Community Grants](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/community-grants/)  Program is one of the most important vehicles the DAO has to accomplish its vision of supporting and facilitating the sustainable growth of the Decentraland platform.\n\nIn the past year, the DAO awarded more than  [$3.5M USD to 58 community led projects](https://governance.decentraland.org/?type=grant\\&status=enacted)  working in different areas such as content creation, developer tools, research, events, game development, among others.\n\nUp to this moment, grant’s beneficiaries update their progress voluntarily using different platforms, such as the DAO’s Discord server, the forum thread of the grant proposal and sometimes presenting their process during the monthly town-halls. **However not every project has informed their progress, nor shipped a final result. This is an issue the DAO should invest energy to address.** The return of impact of our grants is a key asset to build a better platform, **and it is our responsibility to support their development.**\n\nMost of the grants are given through a revocable vesting contract, in other words, **the DAO can revoke the contract and recover the unvested funds if the beneficiary fails to deliver what was promised. However this mechanism has not been used yet, we can argue it’s because of the DAO’s weak oversight capabilities or missing incentives to do so.**\n\nThis proposal is to build a team of experienced producers/project managers to build relationships with grant beneficiaries, hold regular meetings with them to track their progress and, in the case a team fails to deliver, escalate the issue to the DAO to revoke their contract.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis grant will set up a budget to run this team for the next 6 months. This grant could be extended upon a further decision of the DAO if the grant succeeds its objectives.\n\nThe proposed DAO Grant Support Squad will be implemented under the same non-profit foundation created for the  [DAO Governance Squad](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) .

    "body": "> by 0xfc8084cf7e0f916f114f9bdd8a86ba2427efe976 (Tazor#e976)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nPacific Cliffs Foundation Campaign to #SavetheCliffHouse with Community run DAO is planning on not only restoring an historic restaurant to its glory, but a multi faceted entrepreneurial concept that showcases the abundance of  California and the Bay Area culinary, tech and art scenes.  The concept will accentuate people and culture past present and future, linking the Decentraland metaverse to the tangible world in an iconic space.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x05be503958DC1b1382A549Cc6Da14D1CA3155ee9\n\n## Description\n\nThe former 'Cliff House' now more officially, Lands End Properties (LEP), are for up for lease proposal.  The Pacific Cliffs Foundation (PCF) is a community run DAO aimed at winning the bid to lease the Lands End properties.  We are seeking a grant from the Decentraland DAO of $60,000 in order to secure our proposal and set the pieces in motion to make not only our campaign, but the eventual operation a success.\n\nWe have a proposal in place and have lofty plans concocted by local hospitality industry veterans, design professionals, world class construction firms, artists and local families to transform these epic properties into flourishing establishments for locals and tourists.  However, we need to garner the attention of the public in order to generate momentum.  Securing a Decentraland DAO grant will catapult our capabilities  to let us build out or vision and raise a public eyebrow to show that we are serious!\n\nHere's how it works.  The LEP properties will essentially be linked with Decentraland as a major on boarding hub \"in real life\" for Web3 and Decentraland.  Integrating Web3 technology and Decentraland to a tangible space in the real world creates an amazing opprotunity to show what is possible IRL and in the Metaverse.  More specifically, the event space on site will be a Decentraland Metaverse space to bring the Lands End properties and events to everyone around the world, and vice versa.\n\nHost an event on site at the LEP or in Decentraland and it will mirror that event.  For example if I am hosting an educational seminar about how NFTs can revolutionize the publishing industry in the actual event space, it will be broadcast to the corresponding location in Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nUpon receipt of the grant $Mana we will begin a course of action to accelerate our campaign.\n\n1.  Create a ferocious marketing campaign announcing our partnership with Decentraland that highlights key aspects of the project like showcasing the power of a DAO, having a tangible and beautiful space that embraces the past and sees the future, while creating the link between real world and onboarding people to experience Decentraland.\n2.  Showcase the beauty of the property and potential the DAO can have while showcasing the link to Decentraland and how it can be beneficial to the people.\n3.  Buy a land in Decentraland.\n4.  Establish an office in SF where we can hire engineers, creatives and anyone needed to outline and develop our land to be modeled after the original Cliff House, establish our DAO and outline a plan for what to do once we obtain the lease.\n5.  Create an NFT project using local artist and engineers where minting sales and secondary sales all go to the DAO treasury.  NFT project will be hosted and minted through the Land we develop in Decentraland.\n6.  Further development of Decentraland Metaverse Cliff House including adding as a point of interest, establishing meeting spaces, giving virtual tours that can link to real time cameras,  and creating NFTs of any historical photographs or relics and other fun ideas to generate a buzz, raise money and awareness.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nMy name is Trent Simpson and currently, this a project that I have been working on solo, but that is exactly why I am writing this grant!  The grant money will infuse this project with the ability to hire talented people to build the Cliff House in Decentraland while giving us that validity to move forward with the actual space.\n\nI have an extensive background in hospitality and luxury goods sales and marketing on a global scale.  I have seen thousands of incredible restaurants and event spaces around the world, and I truly believe the LEP is one of the most beautiful establishments.  I have set out on a quest to launch a campaign #SavetheCliffHouse via a DAO and showcase the power of community and prove that tangible applications of a DAO can be successful! I was the treasurer for the SF chapter of the United States Bartenders' Guild and am a very passionate student of Web3, NFTs, brand marketing and a good martini overlooking the ocean.\n\nI have started a Twitter and a Medium for the Pacific Cliffs Foundation DAO campaign to #SavetheCliffHouse\nhttps://medium.com/@pacificcliffsfoundation\n@savethecliffhou\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/trentsimpson\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nRoadmap:\n\\-Generate media buzz about #SavetheCliffHouse campaign and DAO getting funding from Decentraland grant\n\\-Create multisig wallet for DAO funds and establish DAO structure\n\\-Buy Decentraland Land and hire developers to make the land modeled after the original Cliff House\n\\-On site offices creating link to physical property and Decentraland\n\\-Integrate event space room to be high tech and operate seamlessly with Decentraland\n\nMilestones:\n\\-Obtain Cliff House Lease\n\\-Sell out NFT collection using our Decentraland land/space as a gallery and minting site\n\\-Host first event in Decentraland and at LEP Event Space\n\\-Pacific Cliffs Foundation DAO has large enough treasury to secure financial future of our lease and operation expenses for long-term\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d7ee5a30-cd07-11ec-8d87-ddbb20320020)**",

    "title": "MAD DAO - Radical Public Lease and Advertisement Bundle Auction Protocol",
    "body": "> by 0x2b7f0615979edddeaf83bfec23f66fb5a6d177a4\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nMAD is dedicated to facilitating interaction in the metaverse and maximizing virtual land utilization. MAD provides a decentralized protocol for landowners to monetize their virtual lands: landowners can stake lands to MAD and generate yield through two MAD products: Radical Public Leasing and Advertisement Batched Auction.\n\nRadical Market is a land renting marketplace with dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand. It lowers the bar for people to enter the metaverse.  For the lands that are not leased out in the radical marketplace, MAD builds billboards on top of them with ads placeholders and employs a bundling auction strategy: all land estates are batched together as a single combined bid to achieve maximum exposure.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n100,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2B7F0615979eddDeAF83BFEC23F66fb5a6D177A4\n\n## Description\n\nMany metaverse spaces separate ownership from utilization rights. Still, there is no efficient market for players to obtain this utilization right, making it difficult for users to build in the metaverse. MAD Radical Market is a use right market where players can access the operational rights of land. Radical Market is a decentralized protocol that establishes a land renting marketplace with dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand.\n\nMAD Radical Public Lease land supply builds on DAO-owned Land Pool and community land pool. MAD will raise money to acquire land across metaverse spaces and put it into the DAO-owned Land Pool. MAD will also call for the community landowners to stake lands to MAD in order to list land in the radical market as a source of additional interest. Users who own metaverse lands or estates can stake their land to MAD. After they stake their asset to MAD, we mint a MAD NFT to the landowner in exchange. Once a user stakes his land, the user can still operate the NFT, such as transferring ownership while staking.\n\nWe believe that virtual land is only as valuable as what we build on it. To better utilize the lands in the land pool and leave no land empty, MAD builders build billboards with ads placeholders on top of all lands that are not leased out in the radical market and batch auction all unused land advertising rights to the public. The bundling strategy is ideal for both landowners and advertisers: with a collection of lands, the value of parcels will increase and can put the lands into greater use; for the advertisers, with larger and more land parcels, they will gain more exposure to their business.\n\n### Why are we applying for Decentraland Grant?\n\nCurrently MAD is at a very early stage and we are raising money from the community to support the development. Decentraland dev documents are the most well structured and easiest to integrate among the major metaverse platforms. It allows us to interface with the smart contract and elaborates the functionalities such as land operator, land manager, etc. We are confident to build out the entire product on top of Decentraland functionalities and eager to get support and feedback from the first metaverse platform that we are building on.\n\n### How MAD can benefit Decentraland Community\n\n#### Landowners Community\n\nMAD protocol can help the existing Decentraland Landowners monetize and generate additional interest on the land assets through Radical Market and Advertisement Batch Auction. \\MAD can also help landowners who don't know how to build easily find builders through our buildersDAO bounty board.\n\n#### Builders\n\nDecentraland has an excellent builders community who are passionate and eager to build. Under MAD there’s a buildersDAO where builders can find bounties more efficiently, and our product Radical Public Lease allows them to get into the space at a lower price. It is essential to both the builders and the Decentraland game because, on the one hand, the feature lowers the bar for both existing and potential builders to get into the space and build. On the other hand, getting more builders to the space is what all metaverse platforms want: we want the world with fully creative builds.\n\n#### General Community\n\nMAD’s Ads Batch Auction and Radical Public Lease lower the bar for the general public to enter the space. Building on top of Decentraland, MAD could attract more people into the Decentraland world.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Front end framework: Typescript React\n\n### Product 1: Radical Public Lease\n\n*   Listing from DAO owned land pool and staking land pool \\[Smart Contract & Front end]\n*   Bidding \\[Smart Contract & Front end]\n    *   Harberger Tax employed here. see rules: https://medium.com/metaverse-advertisement-dao/introducing-metaverse-advertisement-dao-the-radical-market-6edb1a8ae7e5\n*   Set Builder \\[Smart Contract]\n    *   After a user successfully bids on a land parcel, the landowner can set the builder directly on MAD interface.

Free transactions mean that the Decentraland users do not have to pay gas for each meta-transaction (in Polygon) they perform while using the product. This leads to a better UX and lowers the barrier of entry since we subsidize the costs and reduce the number of interactions with the wallet for day-to-day activities such as listing and buying wearables, placing bids and accepting them, publishing wearables, etcetera.\n\nDecentraland has been using **[Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/)**, a meta-transaction relayer, to provide free transactions in Polygon since the **[launch](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor)** of user-generated collections in Polygon on June 1, 2021.\n\nThe way Biconomy works is by providing us with a personalized **gas tank that we need to fill to cover the cost of the meta-transactions.**\n\n\n## Specification\n\nUp until now, the gas tank was filled with funds coming from different Grants asked from the community and provided by the DAO. This time, the proposal is to **establish an ongoing mechanism to maintain the gas tank full over time.** As the community is growing and more transactions are taking place, it’s important to keep it full in favor of the whole community and for the sake of Decentraland’s growth.\n\nIt’s important to consider that there is an **economically sustainable model behind this proposal**, the fees extracted from transactions in the Marketplace, Builder, and other dApps are the second most important source of income for the DAO. The numbers are public and can be seen in the Income dashboard on the [Transparency](https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/) section in the DAO Governance dApp.\n\nThe Decentraland Marketplace generates around USD 250,000 per month in profits, this income would cover the cost of the meta-transactions and the flywheel could keep spinning: better UX > > more transactions > more income for the DAO. If the DAO stops covering the costs of the meta-transactions, then users will need to pay for them to perform almost any action in the dApps, this would discourage people from uploading wearables, bidding, and making transactions in the marketplace. In the end, it would result in less income for the DAO that could be redistributed in the form of Grants and a worse user experience for the Decentraland community.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf this proposal closes and the result is \"YES\",  the DAO Committee will be in charge of swapping Mana for Matic to fill the gas tank in the Biconomy platform, making sure it has always enough Matic to support free meta-transactions in Decentraland.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=3e828730-caf6-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)**",

    "body": "> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Establish a Formal Process for Adding/Removing DAO Committee Members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5fd09520-ae73-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe DAO needs a clear process for removing and adding DAO Committee members. This proposal is a Draft Proposal outlining such a process for community consideration.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe DAO needs to be able to add and remove committee members in a variety of situations:\n\n*   When a committee member resigns\n*   When the community wants to replace a committee member\n*   When a committee member must be removed quickly in an emergency\n\nThere are also several needs that need to be balanced when making changes to the DAO Committee:\n\n*   Decisions must be as decentralized as possible\n    \\-Only qualified and trustworthy candidates should be appointed to the committee\n*   Committee members must be able to collaborate and work well together\n    \\-The committee must be able to act immediately in an emergency\n\nBearing in mind the situations and needs listed above, please review this draft proposal process for removing, sourcing, and appointing DAO Committee members.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Currently**, the process for adding or removing a DAO Committee Member can only be triggered and/or canceled (within a 24 hour delay mechanism) by a Security Advisor Board (SAB) member. This proposal introduces a pathway to expand the stakeholders and processes involved in removing and appointing DAO Committee Members to include the SAB, DAO Committee Members or members of the Decentraland Community.\n\nAdding a new committee member is only initiated following the removal or resignation of an existing member which should be triggerable by any of the above stakeholders, including the committee member wishing to resign.\n\nThe following section introduces the **proposed** processes and procedures that each stakeholder category can initiate in order to remove and subsequently add a member to the DAO Committee.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Removing a committee member**\n\nEach stakeholder category will have a different process for initiating the removal of a DAO Committee Member.\n\n***How a committee member removal can be initiated:***\n\n1.  **By the DAO Committee:**\n\n*   Any committee member can create the delayed transaction in Aragon (including the resigning member)\n*   After 24 hours, the committee member is removed\n*   Any committee members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window.\n*   DAO Committee must create a proposal to confirm the decision with the community\n\n2.  **By the Security Advisory Board:**\n\n*   The SAB can create a delayed committee member removal transaction in Aragon\n    After 24 hours, the member is removed\n*   3 of 5 SAB members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window\n*   In an emergency situation, the SAB can create a removal transaction in Aragon that is immediately implemented, temporarily removing committee powers from a DAO committee member\n*   Transaction must be confirmed by 3 of the 5 SAB members within 24 hours or the Committee Member’s powers are restored. If confirmed, the committee member is removed and their token burned. If unconfirmed they must be reinstated.\n*   If removing a member in an emergency, the SAB must create a proposal to retroactively confirm the decision with the community\n\n3.  **By the community by creating a proposal:**\n\n*   The DAO should add a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal category with the following required parameters:\n    *   The name of the committee member to remove\n    *   Reasoning for the removal of the committee member. This should include evidence supporting their removal in the event of misconduct.\n*   To submit a proposal to remove a committee member a community member must have 5,000 VP or delegated VP.\n*   The acceptance criteria for committee member removal proposals should be set to 6 million VP and 2/3rds participating majority of voting power.\n*   If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes, the committee member is expected to resign.\n*   If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes and the committee member does not wish to resign, the DAO Committee should initiate a delayed removal transaction.\n    In the event that the remaining DAO Committee members do not ratify the removal decision, they must submit a proposal to the community arguing the case for retaining the committee member.\n\n1.  If this proposal is rejected, then the SAB is responsible for removing the committee member.\n2.  If this proposal passes with an acceptance criteria of at least 6 million VP and a 2/3rds participating majority of voting power, then the committee member is not removed.\n\n**After the removal has been approved by the DAO, several steps have to be taken:**\n\n*   In the event of an immediate resignation or emergency removal of a committee member, a member of the SAB should stand in as a temporary member until a replacement is appointed\n*   The Committee member’s COMMITTEE token in Aragon must be burned to prevent them from initiating transactions on the DAO’s behalf.\n*   The Committee member’s address must be removed from the DAO’s multisig proxy.\n*   The process for finding a replacement member should be initiated by the DAO Committee as a post on the Forum calling for applications\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThis proposal will enable multiple pathways for DAO Committee Members to be removed, resign, and be elected to the committee. It also creates legitimate pathways for rapid response by the Security Advisory Board (SAB) and other DAO Committee members in an emergency situation.Up to this time, there has been no formal pathway for the removal or appointment of new committee members.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nAt this time, there is one DAO Committee spot open. Following approval of this proposal, the DAO committee will release an open call for DAO Committee Member Applicants, and follow the process outlined in the conclusion section below. Additionally, the DAO Committee will coordinate with the SAB to modify necessary Parameters via the DAO's Aragon infrastructure.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Adding a committee member**\n\nThe process for adding a committee member includes three stages: the open application period, the committee interviews, and a final vote by ranked choice. If the DAO decides not to implement support for ranked choice voting, then separate proposals could be created for each individual candidate selected by the DAO Committee after the interview stage.\n\n***Open application period (2 weeks)***\n\nApplications submitted as posts on the forum, applicants should answer:\n\n1.  What is your full name?\n2.  What is your primary wallet address?\n3.  Why are you applying?\n4.  What is your history with both Decentraland and Decentraland’s DAO?\n5.  What skills, qualifications, and experience will you bring to the committee?\n6.  Can you commit at least 10 hours per week to the DAO?\n7.  Provide links to any relevant social media profiles or other information that will help the community when evaluating candidates.\n8.  Provide a list of two references, at least one of which is in the Decentraland community that can attest to your character and/or commitment to Decentraland.\n\n***Committee Interviews (1 week)***\n\nGiven how closely the DAO Committee must work together in order to accomplish its goals, it is important that they all work well together as a team. Furthermore, the existing DAO Committee members (having already earned the DAO’s trust) should act as additional filters in the selection process.\n\nThe existing DAO Committee should have 1 week to interview candidates as a panel.\n\n***Final community vote (2 weeks)***\n\nAfter the interview phase, the DAO Committee is responsible for creating a final proposal in the DAO listing their picks for the top 5 candidates. The DAO should implement a ranked choice voting system for committee member additions.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)**",

    "body": "> by 0xae8bf49b1f8d56061bc693b7841c785b8e903ec5 (Turtles)\n\n\"This was idea was featured in an earlier poll of mine, and it caught a lot of traction. I would love to hear the community's response.\"\n\nHello, I am not the first to think of this proposal. However, I wanted to be the voice of the community. As we all know the only reasoning you are able to receive any type of voting power is through the purchase of Names, Mana, or Land/Estates. It's difficult to have decentralized form of governance if the opinions of a few can have decisions over the many. I have seen numerous proposals with 60-100+ yes proposals getting turned down, because 1-2 people vote no with VP that was delegated to them. What we are trying to build shouldn't just be based of the decisions of the elite few, it should come from the voice of the people. For example, why should the opinion of someone who was delegated 1 million VP that doesn't even log into DCL dictate the choices, and the voice of the community of 60+ others that do, or actively try to grow, and make DCL a better Metaverse? For those reasons, I am proposing that we implement a system for giving creators of wearables VP\n\nCreation of Wearables. As many of you know, it costs 100 mana to create a wearable submission. This is the same cost as a name, so why shouldn't you received VP in the same sense? This should equate to 1/4 the cost aka 25 VP per wearable you create. It's smaller than the names, but you have a chance to make mana off of sales, so this seems like a fair trade.\n\nThank you!\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d22828a0-ca7e-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)**",

    "title": "First Decentraland native crypto debit card top up",
    "body": "> by 0xf4b03870807059042b98c7abe889d5e9ed787371\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nMover is the easiest way for web3 natives to spend their assets offline and online. We have built a crypto debit card that can be topped up from a non-custodial wallet of your choice with a token of your choice.\n\nWe are already working with amazing DAOs and projects to let their users easily access their tokens offline. To name a few: Sushi, OlympusDAO, Redacted Cartel, Alchemix, Concave, Moralis, EPNS, and many more. Many other projects are already waiting for the integration!\n\nIntegrating Decentraland would mean that every MANA user will be able to natively (as connect - a wallet, sign a transaction, and magic happens) top up their Mover debit card using the Decentraland metaverse and MANA.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n25,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xf6A0307cb6aA05D7C19d080A0DA9B14eAB1050b7\n\n## Description\n\nOur goal\nOur goal is straightforward. We want to make sure that every Decentraland user can easily access their funds without the need to go to other networks or exchanges at any point in time.\n\nWe are self-funded and have been bootstrapping for over 1,5 years. We have received OlympusDAO and Gitcoin grants for gasless transactions. To offer new features to new users we need your support.\n\nBenefits\n• Our integration requires us to integrate a swap aggregator mesh: to be able to use MANA . It means that all DEXs will directly benefit from this option.\n• Our integration also requires access to bridges: to be able to bridge funds for settlement. It means that Decentraland bridge will also directly benefit from the activity on the bridges.\n• Finally, all DAOs, social projects, and new protocols will also benefit as their tokens (locked, vested, and other liquid assets) will also become available for the top-up.\n• This integration benefits the MANA ecosystem by introducing a new level of utility for all MANA-based assets.\n\nFlexible and Extendable\n• We have a very modular platform, that will allow other projects on Decentraland to access our infrastructure and build their on card solutions on top of ours.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe most important single aspect to mention is that our solution is already live.\n\nSome additional information\nOur website: [here](https://viamover.com)\n\nA demo of card top up with an ERC20 token: [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v77jcatfmrMYssP0vJamql7TF9xjrsnZ/view?usp=sharing)\n\nFirst ever on-chain card top up with alUSD (self-repaying card top up): [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc10a4c726a3cc8c1750b5d6d68067a5a17e9647e5b3eac0eeb1e9f7a17c35dc1)\n\nOur vision: [here](https://holyheldlabs.com/the-future-we-shape.pdf)\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nWe are a small team of builders. We are self-funded team of 7: two co-founders, and five team members. We are working full-time on making web3 more accessible and simple to everyone. Our team members consist of 2 Ukrainians and 1 Female.\n\nOur experience\nThe founders, we: Anton M & Anton Z, have been working together in fintech since 2017. Now we are working together again on the new web3 savings experience.\n• Anton Z has 15+ years of experience in IT\n• Anton Z won Microsoft programming contest\n• Anton Z holds PhD in Computer Engineering\n\n• Anton M is a serial fintech & web3 founder\n• co-Founder & CTO at Humaniq selected as a top use case by the  UK Parliament in APPG with over 500,000+ users.\n• Built Jthereum — a first Java to Solidity transpiler\n• Anton M was nominated as a tech leader of the year by TechXLR8\n• Anton M was a Blockchain Advisor at WeWork Fintech Labs\n• Anton M won top pick in Blockchain by TechCrunch\n\nWhy us?\nBecause we can execute. We have successfully built and executed this use case on numerous networks. We have a track record with amazing partners. We are open-source and open to all new crazy ideas that can make web3 more accessible and friendly.\nFinally, we are builders just like the community here.\n\nWe have 4 rockstar developers:\nhttps://github.com/trukach000\nhttps://github.com/Sinu5oid\nhttps://github.com/bog5651\nhttps://github.com/buba-developer\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nDevelopment Roadmap\nTo make MANA available as card top-up options, we are asking for a $25,000 grant. The grant will include building and open-license/open-source the following elements:\n• Mover Central Transfer Proxy - a generalised proxy contract that manages the logic of a swap, bridge and transaction settlement (Update of the contract)\n• Mover Swap mesh exchange contract - a contract that manages token swap (Update of the contract)\n• Mover bridge mesh contract - a contract that initiates a non-custodial bridge from a contract to contract (Update of the contract)\n• Mover card top-up logic/contract - settlement flow (Update of the contract)\n\nMetrics for success\nWe believe that the success of our integration can be measured with the following metrics:\n\n1.  Total volume (of cash-in and cash-out options). This metric speaks for itself: the higher the volume, the more the network assets are used.\n2.  Total transactions (every top-up requires at least one swap and a bridge transaction). It affects network usage.\n3.  Number of new projects on the network with Mover integration. This metric affects ecosystem growth.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=06eece00-c96b-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)**",

The main purpose of my page is to make easier for the everyday user to know more about the current events of the day, with informative short videos about the events details and artist's background (if any performing). Think of it as the live events list, but with subtitled videos explaining them.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xBD03aDd5da0e173C67C9C1073FFBA017147c42d4\n\n## Description\n\nOne thing I noticed is that somedays it can get hard to keep track of events! My goal is to make the event page more digestable for the average user, by visually explaining the activities of the day.\n\nCurrently I'm doing AT LEAST 3x subtitled videos per day, the next step is doubling that. My goal is to bring more awareness to the whole community overall.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nIf the grant is approved, i'll expand the team to cover the entire events page every single day. I aim to create translated videos to the Brazilian audience and expand to tiktok and youtube shorts. I'll also invest in paid ads for both pages monthly.\n\nTwitter page: https://twitter.com/DclHighlights\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nMy name is Vapo and I create videos by myself. I've been working fulltime in metaverse-related content since december 2021, contributing with videos and advertisement in different projects.\n\nMy objective is to become a steady source of video news about Decentraland events. I want to continue creating relevant content everyday in multiple platforms to bring new users and keep current players updated as much as possible!\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nI will post new subtitled content (minimum) 6 times PER DAY in multiple platforms (youtube, tiktok and twitter).\n\nI will also report progress at the end of every week.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=25891a40-c84a-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)**",

As we all know the only reasoning you are able to receive any type of voting power is through the purchase of Names, Mana, or Land/Estates. It's difficult to have decentralized form of governance if the opinions of a few can have decisions over the many.

Accrual of VP based on time spent in DCL In-game. This can be done by counting activity spent in the Metaverse as a time translation to VP. For example, what if you logged into DCL, and were active either by participating in activities, social experiences, ICE Poker, and others etc. Whether it's a certain allotted amount of time, or maybe days this seems like a fair exchange of governance say for those involved.\n\n2.  Creation of Wearables. As many of you know, it costs 100 mana to create a wearable submission. This is the same cost as a name, so why shouldn't you received VP in the same sense? This should equate to 1/4 the cost aka 25 VP per wearable you create. It's smaller than the names, but you have a chance to make mana off of sales, so this seems like a fair trade.\n\n3.  Participation in Governance Voting. Those who vote, regardless of their VP, should be able to reach a threshold of earning VP, for helping out the governance body. This would encourage a more diverse opinion of many in DCL, and hopefully increase participation on the DAO.\n\nThese are 3 such ways we can help to improve our governance system, and the future of Decentraland in general! I look forward to your opinions!

These NFT wearables are the world's first Italian handmade leather phygital sneakers which you can wear exploring Decentraland, or you can burn the NFT to redeem the identical physical pair of sneakers to wear in real-life.\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n40\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nThis is a collaborative project between Another-1 and Swappable by TrustSwap.\n\nYou can find out more about Another-1 and their team with the following links:\n\nhttps://another-1.io\nhttps://twitter.com/AN1official\nYou can find out more about Swappable and TrustSwap with the following links:\n\nhttps://swappable.io\nhttps://twitter.com/Swappable_NFTs\nhttps://trustswap.com\nhttps://twitter.com/TrustSwap\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe are super hyped to bring our wearables to Decentraland!\n\nWe're excited to share our sneakers with the DCL community, and all the exceptional communities of the projects we've collaborated with to create NTR1-META's, so all can enjoy and wear our remarkable sneakers!\n\nWe moved into Crypto Valley 1.5 years ago, made ourselves at home, and put on some wild events for the community in TrustSwap HQ. We're now taking our involvement with the community to the next level by dropping these wearables!\n\nNTR1-META sneakers are inspired by the magic of the chameleon. Our team admires the human ability to change in the face of adversity, much like how the Chameleon morphs the color of its skin cells to survive in the most challenging circumstances.\n\n\n## Smart Contract Address\n\n- 0xF20B2647679D32FF36dCD17Fe4FfA5661EF79E7b\n\n\n## Manager Addresses\n\n- 0x73B8bFA9B609077999E41a4E6A3E233dBF70fAA0\n- 0x6b5f57da94f9bfabd314d3c0dc2486204d2f15ee\n\n\n## Is this collection generated programmatically?\n- No\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d0a78c80-c6e3-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)**",

Users can play a few types of Arcade mode, PVC, and PvP modes, earn in-game currency like balls, chips, and change it for NFTs. Ball Cards & Wearables grants access to different game mechanics. Cues NFT have an in-game utility like hit power, angle of fine-tuning, etc.\n\n### Links\n\n*   [8MetaBalls DCL Location](https://play.decentraland.org/?NETWORK=mainnet\\&position=117,-25)\n*   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/8Metaballs)\n*   [Discord](https://discord.gg/ntzkBZJ3Pt)\n*   [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/8-metaballs)\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xb12ba0b2dc9d9811a7e3b1f76b3f8318bcb58f20\n\n## Description\n\nIt is a resubmission of our [previous grant proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=29559bb0-ab37-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231).\nWe didn't reach a threshold last time but collected a lot of support from the community. One month has passed and we want to share the progress we made during that time:\n\n### From the roadmap we have posted in the last proposal:\n\n*   **MultiPlayer**: The first version of multiplayer is ready and deployed. Players can play against each other. We implemented more rules for more realistic gameplay.\n*   The first iteration of the **new UI** in union style (instead of the free stock version) is ready. [You can see it here](https://www.figma.com/file/FSYwJGUFDYb9Ve3ApbS6Dg/8MetaBalls?node-id=0%3A1). We are turning the design into the code, and it will be on the scene within a week.\n*   **Events with the daily prizes**: Started $ prizes event \"Leader of the day\" - the leader of the day counts by total internal currency earned getting $ reward + internal stuff reward.\n*   **PvP tournament** prepared and made by community members will start on 15 May.\n*   One **SDK dev joined the team** full-time.\n*   The graphic designer joined the team for half-day **for UI building** and marketing stuff.\n*   **Analytics**. We deployed the second iteration of analytics a couple of weeks ago. Now we can see all things players interact with on the scene and in-game.\n*   **A few interesting numbers from it**:\n    *   Players spend about **100 hours daily playing pool** - total time played in-game (counts by seconds of the game, excluding time when players just stay on the scene and don't play). It's more than four days on average of raw gameplay in a day.\n    *   Some quick conclusions from the first look at analytics allowed us to make immediate changes in the game and [make players happier](https://twitter.com/TonyMo74/status/1518520837871132672).\n        Sure the example on the link is pretty simple, but it’s huge for daily players. We’ve gone further and now we are making more changes based on analytics.\n*   We are one of **the most popular scenes by CCU** in DCL.\n    Sharing 4th place with Genesis Plaza from time to time.\n\n### Invisible things under the hood are already done and in progress:\n\n*   Significant physics improvement. It's become more realistic. And we are continuously working on it.\n*   All physics and gameplay logic for PvP mode moved from the scene to a server for more robust work and prevented bots from cheating.\n*   Separate server to serve PvP mode since all calculations are in the server.\n*   Since the new dev joined the team, a ton of code was refactored to work together and onboard new devs in the future much more smoothly.\n*   Many reusable modules/components for further development like permission module (to get access for different mechanics and features), level builder, network debugger, etc\n*   PvC mode improvements.\n*   New classic levels to arcade mode & new Arcade mode with obstacle\n*   We are also preparing a new arcade \"crazy mode\" - with unusual table shapes and unusual physics.\n*   Cue-sticks - visual improvements, animation of hit, different guidelines based on cue level, gameplay improvement, more accurate aiming with a red-dotted ball, ability to make complex hits, cue wear and repair, etc.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nSix months of development have passed in one day. The game has started from \"let's try what SDK can do now\" (I haven't touched it since it was on babylon.js in 2018) to the team with four members working full time on the project, a few people working part-time, thousands of players, and great feedback from the community.\n\nWe are still committed to the roadmap from the last proposal, but I want to explain my vision to high-level points we want to work on.\n\n*   **Numbers of players** - obviously, the more players play the game, the more successful it is. The number one goal is to grow DAU, WAU, MAU, and CCU metrics.\n    We plan to achieve it through different game modes, such as PvP, PvC, Tournaments, Pools Clubs, and a few types of Arcade modes. Marketing activity and Events. Adding more game mechanics and social interactions. Bring more utility-based NFT and wearables.\n\n*   **Developing the codebase**. Two devs are working on the project so far. I and a new TypeScript SDK Dev who joined our team full-time this month. We need one more dev for a backend, DevOps, CI/CD, server stuff, and one more SDK dev for scene development.\n\n*   **Visual part.** Improving the visible part of the scene and game. New 3D buildings, tables, chests, boards, cues, interior & exterior design. 2D UI development. Sound improvement.\n\n*   **Internal economics/game balance & monetization.** The most exciting part. We already have a dual currency economy with stimulus to achieve rewards and possibilities to spend it in exchange for different game items. But it's still in the early stage. Here we plan to add significantly more ways to achieve rewards, a bunch of ways to spend them. Add user retention mechanics like game chests, daily super-games, loot boxes, and collection items. Add more NFT with in-game utility, such as cue chalk(which prevents bad hits), gloves (makes hits more accurate), etc.\n\n*   **Continue to develop analytics.** The most important part. To achieve the goals, we have to understand what's going on. Which mechanics increase our metrics, and how do different changes affect them. Eventually, build \"adult metrics\" of acquisition, engagement, and monetization such as stickiness rate, churn rate, retention rate, ARPU, ARPPU, LTV, ATV, etc.\n\n*   **Game Center.** The long-term goal is to transform a single-game scene (8MetaBalls) into a Game center with multiple games covering different interests and audiences.\n    And combine these games into one unified economy.\n    I am already creating PoC for several games in my spare time. But our primary efforts are the development of 8MetaBalls so far. When we achieve all the things I've mentioned above, it will be much easier and faster to deliver additional games and embed them into the scene and economics.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n*   **Tony - core dev**: Former marketing lead in retail & e-commerce(long ago). TS/Phyton/C#/Solidity developer. Former core dev in a private quantitative crypto fund. From 2021 went deeper into DeFi, DAO, chains stuff. The finalist of Binance DeFi CIS Hackaton in April 2021.

It was made possible by embedding an innovative state-of-the-art AI code within our first chicken NFTs.\nThe CryptoChicken plays and interacts with the owner as well as the environment, bridging the gap of static pets with limited functionality in the Metaverse.\nOur team currently has a small staff of talented individuals with a variety of significant capabilities. Each member comes from multiple types of professional formations such as finance, web development, and business studies, besides having worked with multiple noteworthy businesses.\nOur vision is to empower Decentraland's community with smart and interactive pets that have yet to tread on this land.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x01F0b8e92F0ca0398482C265a99612196c8782fE\n\n## Description\n\nHello fellow Decentralanders!\nWe are MetaPlay®, a newly founded NFT development company with the sole desire to innovate and expand the horizons of Decentraland and the metaverse as a whole.\nOur first NFT project is called TheCryptoChickenCollective.\n(For a sample, go check out the info on specifications below!)\nWith this project, we are fulfilling a major desire for Decentraland 's user base, which is the need for having a companion animal that follows you around. Until now, this was currently only available as a static wearable that is constrained to your avatar and mimics your steps... we thought this simply wasn't enough.\nOur chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community!\n\nTheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating Decentraland's first pet that moves independent of the users avatar motions.\nIn addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect the overall statistics of it.\nAs our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another RIGHT IN DECENTRALAND!\nThat’s right! Never before has anyone accomplished an animated companion that could be seen by all users and could fight right in Decentraland... until now.\nAll previous \"fight\" projects have users do the actual “fighting” on a completely different website and server. We wanted to take it a step further. For the first time in history, the CryptoChickens will allow for its users to mint, raise, and fight your companions against your friends right in Decentraland.\nSide note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) in Decentraland a real possibility in the near future *winky face*.\n\nWe believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL.\nWhile we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest.\nAlthough we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap!\n\nWe have broken down the estimated costs that we have calculated to ensure a smooth progress of our vision… Upon being approved for the funding we have asked for in this proposal we intend on: reimbursing our team for all out of pocket expenses ($10k), purchasing land for the project ($65k for an estate), launching a full scale marketing campaign (30k), and provide a full time income for all members of MetaPlay so that we may continue to innovate and shatter the current limitations of the platform ($4k per month for 5 members for 5 months = $100k). The remaining $35k that we are requesting will be used to hire on additional design and development support staff so that we can ensure that all promised content will be delivered in a timely manner.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOur developer and designer are world class professionals, with over 30 years of experience in their respective industries.\nOur designer has done animation, and graphics for a variety of television, film and corporate projects and our developer has played a key role in the development of software for NASA, Unity, and Lightwave 3D.\nDue to the proprietary nature of the coding we are unable to disclose the exact manner in which we achieved the animated companions but we hope that our current example on our Land (22,89) will prove to be enough evidence that we know what we are doing and can deliver everything promised in a timely manner.\nBasically we created a cool looking chicken that, while in the beta testing phase, anyone can claim and enjoy within our C.C.C. partnered LAND.\nTo check out what all the hype is about please visit our land at: ChickenLand (22,89) (link provided below)\n\n(INSTRUCTIONS: Click the red box on the corner (only once), wait for it to turn green, then go to the middle statue and click summon your chicken. Disclaimer: we are aware that currently there is a  bug that causes multiple chickens to be summoned if you click the box multiple times, causing them to fuze into one 'mutant' chicken, We assure you that this is only the beta test and that our devs will have the issue corrected shortly.\n\nFor more detailed information pertaining to our whitepaper please visit:\nThe Crypto Chicken Collective whitepaper: https://docs.metaplay.cafe/\n\nAny and all updates on our project will be relayed through the following channels:\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/\\_CryptoChickens\nDiscord:  https://discord.com/invite/8VwaMV3vcw\nWebsite:  https://www.metaplay.cafe/\n\n(Website is still under construction... brand new website coming soon!!!)\n\nFor access to The Crypto Chicken Collective official land plot click the link below:\n\nDecentraland ChickenLand: https://play.decentraland.org/?island=I1be6x\\&position=22%2C89\\&realm=dg\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n@Trag (CTO) ➺ software architect with over 30 years of experience in every aspect of the game industry, from high speed server design to graphics and gameplay.

It is currently one of the most visited scenes in Decentraland at all times of the day, ranking in top 10 scenes more often than not.\n\nIt started as a 1 man project with the help of Decentraland DAO approving a grant of 3000$ to fund the initial idea, and has grown into one of the most ambitious projects in Decentraland with a strong community and fast pace of development.\n\nWe are now starting to expand our team and hitting the accelerator as we work towards achieving a Product Market Fit and  building the foundations for a decentralized organization that can survive for years to come.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4262f8BB5bd9Ad132782D2a7279b532A1DC6BCbF\n\n## Description\n\nWebsite: https://www.wildernessp2e.com\n\nWhitepaper : https://www.wildernessp2e.com/whitepaper\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/y4GxdEPz4x\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/wildernessp2e\n\nWilderness NFTs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tg6ZztQUDMRjERKCgf2kaim4J8epNl50ftGvUuTCCao/\n\n**Current Ecosystem**:\n\nWilderness started as an MMORPG which provides a fun gaming experience while incentivizing players with earning opportunities. Wilderness creates a vibrant economy for its players with 0 Price for Participation \\[Free to Play] by **earnestly distributing the value created in the game back to its players**.\n\nStarting with an immersive Magic Combat experience, Wilderness players enter a fantasy world to explore mythical creatures in a fantasy world, discover new tactics everyday and build the best strategies with and against other players.\n\nHere are some of the highlights of what we have developed so far:\n\n*   7 NPCs you can fight to earn Wilderness Coins. Each of these have a different attacking style, skills and give different rewards.\n*   5 Spells like Lava Rage to throw a fireball at the opponent or Ice Cold to freeze the opponent.\n*   XP and Leveling system to enable long term players to get the maximum earning potential and social clout\n*   Beginner and Daily Quests to give the players a smaller goal with rewards\n*   A Referral System where anyone can refer a new player to help both of them earn extra coins.\n*   POAPs for key achievements in the game.\n*   A Clan System where Clan Masters can delegate Clan Membership to other players and earn a passive income. Clan Members get benefits in the form of exclusive team gameplay.\n*   An Event everyday, and sometimes more! From daily PvP competitions to weekly extra coin Saturday, double XP Sunday, and an upcoming Magic Themed party.\n\n**Growth**:\n\n*   Strong and Active Community of 850+ on Discord, 1400+ on Twitter\n*   25,000+ Unique Visitors in just 4 months\n*   2500+ Unique Players have earned a Wilderness NFT \\[many of them earned their first NFT ever]\n*   Active Presence on Twitch  with Neyyyhhaa, co-founder of Wilderness, streaming regularly with an average viewership of 35+\n*   $6000+ in secondary market sales creating an estimated market Cap of $40,000+ for Wilderness NFTs . We are proud to enable so many players to earn money for doing things they love.\n*   The Week \\[One of India’s most reputed Magazines] wrote an article about us : https://www.theweek.in/news/sci-tech/2022/04/21/the-promise-and-potential-of-play-to-earn-games-with-wilderness-P2E.html\n\n**Limitations**:\n\nWe are continuously trying to push the limits of what can be done with Decentraland SDK from a technical standpoint, but there are certain limitations we can’t overcome at this point which lead to a not so ideal gameplay experience when you compare it to games outside of Decentraland.\nWe plan to combat this by continuously working with the Decentraland Foundation by providing feedback regularly and making commits in the Decentraland code.\n\n**How does this help the DCL community?**\n\n*   Improved experience for new users who are looking for P2E games.\n*   User growth because of new users who specifically join Decentraland to play Wilderness P2E\n*   Community Modules to help the entire DCL developers community\n*   New Earning Opportunities for all of DCL users. Our players have already earned $6,000+ \\[~ 50% of that being last month].\n*   Educational Content for Decentraland : We need to educate users about Decentraland to educate them about Wilderness.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Budget Breakdown**\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BAXwal50qgMO_EsrZqx9TBZcFWpfjj41PV5qKFXStS8/\n\n**Tech Stack**\n\nSolidity \\[Polygon Chain Smart Contracts], TypeScript \\[DCL SDK and Custom Built NodeJS Server], Blender 3D \\[3D Designs and Animation], Canva and Adobe Photoshop \\[2D Designs]\n\n**Revenue and Sustainability**\n\nAs detailed in the Wilderness Whitepaper, the tokenization of Wilderness Coin \\[will be achieved before the deadline for this proposal] will allow for a consistent revenue stream for the game without making it a “Pay to Win” game, which has been one of our guiding principles right from the start.\nThe Wilderness Treasury will receive 5% of all primary sales of Play 2 Earn Rewards in Wilderness \\[These Wearables/NFTs are never sold outside of the game by the team and can only be obtained for Wilderness Coins]. The Wilderness Treasury will also receive 2.5% of all secondary sales of Wilderness NFTs across all marketplaces \\[DCL, Opensea, Wilderness Marketplace]\n\nWe have been growing at a growth rate of 8% W-o-W over the last couple of months. As we improve this number and continue to grow Week over Week, we target to grow our Playerbase by a factor of 10x in the next 6 months.\n\nAssuming that the value of Wilderness NFTs grows linearly (n) with player growth and the Secondary market trading volume grows quadratically (n^2) with player growth, we will be able to generate $20,000+ in revenue from primary sales \\[5% commission] and $10,000+ in revenue from secondary sales, allowing us to be sustainable by optimizing our expenses by ~ 20%.\n\nPlan B : If the goals we have set are not achieved, we will heavily cut down on our operating expenses. We also have the community support to be able to raise money by sale of DAO tokens, and the ability to raise funds from VCs/Angel Investors considering our background and strong execution.\n\nPlan B is Plan B for a reason however. Decentralizing before achieving a strong Product Market fit can lead to slower pace of development and getting capital from VCs/Angels comes with its own set of problems \\[giving control away to a third party that is only interested in making money]\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nRyan - Founder & CEO/CTO\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/palryan/\n\nNeha - Co-Founder & COO\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/neha-singh-9b215568/\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/neyyyhaaa\n\nSaranya - Part Time designer\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/saranya-satheesh-b6abba1a8/\n\n25+ Partners and community Moderators.\nFind a full list at : https://wildernessp2e.com/#team\n\nOur team has a proven track record in Decentraland. We started building in December last year with a $3,000 grant from the DAO for development of the prototype of this game. Many critics said that it is too ambitious and simply can’t be achieved in 1 month. Yet, Wilderness Play 2 Earn was created and has now grown into a much larger project than anyone could have imagined back then.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**May - Jul 2022**\n\n*   Release of Wilderness Coin on blockchain \\[before 1st May] and listing \\[Coinmarketcap, Coingecko, etc]\n*   A dedicated Marketplace for Wilderness NFTs with extra features specific to Wilderness Ecosystem.\n*   Monthly Magic Parties\n*   Releasing 15+ New Wearable NFTs as P2E rewards.\n*   Moving Wilderness P2E to a larger land \\[20 Parcels]\n*   Redesign of the Scene on a Fantasy Theme\n*   Reducing Lag by optimizing server & scene codebase.\n*   Improving the new user experience - in-game tutorial.\n*   Adding optional Rules and NFT Betting in 1v1 combat mode.\n*   Improving the Clan Management and Delegation System \\[Open-to-all Clans, Custom Commission, Name/Logo Personalization].\n\n**Aug - Oct 2022**\n\n*   Adding new functionalities on the Wilderness P2E Website \\[Player Exploration, Highscores, Transaction Transparency, Clan Management]\n*   Releasing 15+ New Wearable NFTs as P2E rewards during this period.\n*   New Community Modules for SDK development \\[UI Module, Sprites/Animation Module, etc]\n*   Monthly Magic Parties\n*   New features for Decentraland \\[starting with a Level 2 naming system] \\[https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b8978790-85a1-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123]\n*   AI NPCs - to help players around and just talk to them when they are bored.\n*   Expansion of gameplay in form of new minigames \\[NPC waves, Area Capture, etc]\n*   Clan v Clan Battles with daily coverage on Twitch.\n*   15+ High quality Youtube Videos/Detailed Articles to educate new Users \\[of Wilderness and DCL].\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=73921310-c519-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4)**",

    "body": "> by 0x4317036d2cb249e3e4b847164674b7d27c33442b (NikkiFuego)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWith the recent desire for vehicles in DCL, we see the need for a new type of game experience. We want to create a vehicle safe haven called Vroomway. Players will play racing-style game experiences to gather resources, craft parts, and redeem wearables with those parts. Each wearable will be a Skin and when equipped on Vroomway land will transform their avatar into the corresponding vehicle model. Players will have both PVE and PVP-style experiences.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4317036d2Cb249e3e4B847164674B7d27C33442b\n\n## Description\n\nLike we mentioned above, there is a strong desire for vehicles in DCL. Not only a desire for them, but a use case for them as well. Vroomway will provide not only a place for vehicles to live, but also a place for vehicle lovers to commune. We believe our social corner will be a safe place for people to hang out, party, and learn. Players can receive EXP points purely by dancing on the dance floor while their vehicle re-charges. Creating a theoretically endless experience.\n\nPlayers will have the opportunity to not only redeem the skins/vehicles, but they will also be able to [upgrade their vehicles](https://www.notion.so/Vehicles-abd6af1408cb4217a8e2f5d50813f44c) from level 1 to level 3. Each higher-level yields higher attributes. Mythic and Unique vehicles will be automatically set to level 3 for their rarity.\n\nThe first release in the game will be the Parking Garage. Players must spend FUEL to race. Players get an x amount of fuel every 24 hours and also can receive it as a reward/drop. Players can also get fuel cost reduction from temporary perks purchased in the shop or from crafting certain vehicles! The parking garage will be pretty straightforward, to begin with. Phase 1 will have several floors with various types of obstacles. Every lap there will be 3 randomly spawned cargo crates that if they run over they can collect. These cargo crates contain a randomized assortment of resources/materials. These cargo containers can only be opened in the Junkyard. While also in the Junkyard, players can rummage through the scrap piles to gather additional resources/materials. Players will take these materials and resources to the crafting station where they can craft vehicle tokens to redeem at the shop. In addition to redeeming the skins/vehicles with the vehicle tokens, players can also buy more cargo crates as well as temporary game perks. You can read more about each section and the concept visuals [HERE](https://www.notion.so/Scene-Details-8c1ec1ccead7493e8355e440efbc860d)\n\nThe second release will be our Demo Derby. This will bring derby car-style gaming to the mix. Players will face off in a PVP instance consisting of 5-10 players all with derby cars. This will also introduce a line of Derby Car vehicles with perks pertaining to the Demo Derby experience. We plan to provide a range of different perks to suit different play styles.\n\nThe last addition will be the Fuego Speedway. The Speedway will consist of a PVP battle royal type of experience. Players will race around a giant 2x8 track with various obstacles. Players will have power-ups and power-downs that they can use on themselves or other players.\n\nNikki envisions Vroomway hosting never before seen tournaments with never before seen prizes. With the full deployment of the game, Vroomway will host competitive seasons every 2 months and the winner of each season will be rewarded with a 1:1 skin/vehicle. Nikki also sees a major opportunity for cross-promotion/collaboration with other play 2 earn games currently in DCL. With the introduction of seasons, we can also change the Parking Garage configuration each time to give players a new feel to the\n\nNikki Fuego has assembled a team that is both passionate about the project and passionate about the community it is being made for. Nikki alone has 12 years of experience in the digital business industry. Nikki herself is an avid gamer and heavily involved with the DCL community as both a player and a creator.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nBudget: $60,000\n\nMonth 1 - Infrastructure Part A = $9,500\n\nMonth 2 - Infrastructure Part B = $9,400\n\nMonth 3 - Public Alpha = $9,600\n\nMonth 4 - Official Launch = $10,250\n\nMonth 5 - Demo Derby = $11,000\n\nMonth 6 - Fuego Speedway = $9,750\n\nYou can find the full budget breakdown [HERE](https://www.notion.so/Expenses-80c597f11f5e4b0bbe973da760e00b57)\n\nWe have a private land arrangement for both the private development and full deployment of Vroomway. You can see the blueprints [HERE](https://www.notion.so/Land-Blue-Prints-cce17aa319cf4a6aa6e9c85c5c914e1c)\n\nWe have a pretty robust redeemable and upgrading system planned for the vehicles. We plan to launch with 4 Mythic and 3 unique vehicles to exclusive holders. you can read more about [HERE](https://www.notion.so/Vehicles-abd6af1408cb4217a8e2f5d50813f44c)\n\nThere are also attributes attached to the vehicles that players can craft. The game will launch with 3 initial rarity types to claim - Rare, Epic, and Legendary - with plans in the future to release redeemable Mythic and Unique vehicles. Anyone who owns an original VroomVroom or VroomVroom Model O will be amongst the first to receive a bonus in-game. Players that currently possess any Mythic/Unique wearable published by Nikki Fuego, will receive a vehicle to match those wearables and their rarities.

We have a flying vehicle experience planned but will take a lot of development/support to achieve seamlessly.\n\nWe will have a fully public discord server where we will continuously update the community on the game progression. We will post weekly announcements providing important information to the public and the Vroomway community.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nNikki Fuego - Founder, Project Manager, Marketing, 3D Artist\n\nQuantumxGear - Publicist\n\nDoctorDripp - Community Manager\n\nNeocyber - Lead Developer\n\nDogman - Secondary Developer\n\nDoki - 3D Artist\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMonths 1 & 2 will be dedicated to creating the game infrastructure.\n\n*   Player Metrics\n*   Time system\n*   Vehicle system\n*   3D Environment\n*   Junkyard system\n*   Crafting system\n*   Shop system\n*   Social Corner system\n*   User Interface\n*   Servers and API\n*   Inventory system\n*   Parking Garage system\n*   Leaderboard system\n*   3D Artwork - skins/vehicles, garage, and other assets\n\nMonth 3 will be the alpha deployment of the game with the Parking Garage as the main attraction.\n\n*   Grand Opening Event\n*   Press releases & Marketing efforts\n*   Community engagement\n*   Receive feedback about optimizing the gameplay experience for the launch\n\nMonth 4 will an official launch with the deployment of the redeemable wearables.\n\n*   Publish 3 skins as redeemable wearables with the deployment of matching vehicles\n*   Begin development on Demo Derby\n*   Upgrade Junkyard\n*   Upgrade Social Corner\n*   Upgrade Parking Garage height with additional land expansion\n*   Start weekly community events\n\nMonth 5 will introduce the Demo Derby and its redeemable wearables.\n\n*   Deploy Demo Derby\n*   Publish 3 skins as redeemable wearables with the deployment of matching vehicles\n*   Begin development on Fuego Speedway\n*   3D Artwork - Season 1 Winner\n*   Develop a competitive season system\n\nFinally, month 6 will launch the Fuego Speedway and effectively push the game into its final deployment.\n\n*   Deploy Fuego Speedway\n*   Deploy Competitive Season 1: Red\n*   Start development of Party/Group system\n*   Upgrade servers\n*   Upgrade Parking Garage\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9b0c5c80-c4eb-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4)**",

    "title": "[Resubmission] Should the legacy POI list be deleted?",
    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct#4d8d)\n\n> \\[This is a resubmission of [this original](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b3cb6dc0-9f01-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a) proposal that didn't meet the VP Threshold]\n\n### Introduction\n\nPoints of Interest (or POIs) are a great way for users to explore and learn about cool places inside Decentraland. Right now the Decentraland project is maintaining two lists of POIs:\n\n*   Decentraland Foundation-maintained list, the first implementation of POIs (Legacy POI List).\n*   DAO-maintained list, updated by the DAO Committee after a governance proposal for adding or removing a POI is approved.\n\n### Problem\n\nThis **creates an unnecessary complexity** by having to maintain two lists and prevents the DAO community from removing POIs that are defined on the legacy list by using the POI Removal proposal type.\n\nOn a more philosophical level, having a POI list embedded on the World Explorer (aka. Reference Client) **goes against the principle of decentralization and community ownership of the project** since another client wouldn't be able to use that list.\n\n### Potential Solutions\n\nThere are a couple of solutions we could implement if we want to unify both lists:\n\n*   We could simply migrate all POIs from the Legacy POI List to the DAO maintained one. However the legacy list has 90 POIs, and adding all those by an on-chain transaction will have an estimated gas fee of 200 USD each, **totaling a ~$18.000 USD expense to keep those POIs**\n\n*   We could also delete the Legacy POI List and let the community re-add the POIs that are still relevant (Genesis Plaza for example!) to the DAO-maintained list. To minimize the risk of losing an important POI, before the deletion of the Legacy list we could have a discussion on Discord and the Forum about the relevant POIs that we absolutely need to migrate so we can start creating proposals right after the Legacy list has been deleted.\n\n[Legacy POI List](https://config.decentraland.org/explorer.json) -  See the [spreadsheet version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sdjojNKYUOLt-5v2KHnE4-9IFR5zjsUhqckRNVdNX2o/edit#gid=1503583878) with POI names\n\nThis pre-proposal Poll aims to gather community feedback on the next steps. If any of the YES options get selected, this will become a DRAFT proposal for the community to vote on.\n\n- Yes, delete the legacy list and let the community vote for the POIs that should be re-added to the DAO maintained list\n- Yes, delete the legacy list and make the DAO pay for adding the 90 legacy POIs\n- No, maintain both lists\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=78635ac0-c4d8-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4)**",

As a self funded start-up, 10 months ago we set out to prove that comedy has a platform in the virtual world.  With over 15 successful shows including the first Comedy in the metaverse, MIC DROP; we are back with a brand-new festival comedy concept STREAM-X - The First Metaverse Podcast Festival.**\n\nOver the past 10 months Decentral Comedy has been testing the comedy concept in the virtual world through various types of shows and experiences, including MIC DROP - Feb. 23-26. 2022\n\nWe have focused on homing in on the best comedy experience possible a user can have by taking the 20 years of comedy experience our team has in the real world and testing in DCL.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x20D9838616659e174d4937eE9E7738c032c3a881\n\n## Description\n\nIn Feb. 2022, Decentral Comedy took the Metaverse by storm with the world’s first ever Metaverse Comedy Festival, MIC DROP headlined by comedy superstar Gilbert Gottfried.\\\nDecentral Comedy’s motto is “In it For the Laughs” and we want to bring these experiences to users of Decentraland for free and our next big project:\n\nINTRODUCING STREAM-X - 96 HOURS of continuous content, accompanied with other interactive experiences such as AMA's in Discord, Avatar \"Meet & Greets\", special NFT wearable and NFT giveaways and more!\n\nComics such as Andrew Schulz, Artie Lange, Dan Soder, Shane Gillis, Tyler Morrison and so many more!!\n\nMay 25th-28th, 2022\n\nDecentral Comedy Club, the brand new \"DC podcast studio\", Decentral Games locations (casinos and more), any other partners that would love to be involved!\n\nThe Users in Decentraland will experience 96 continuous hours of comedy podcasts over the course of the 4 days.  This format is made to appeal to ALL DCL users around the world, being able to tune in at any point in the day for comedy content! Users will have access to special shows such as interactive experiences such as AMA's in Discord, Avatar \"Meet & Greets\", special NFT wearable and NFT giveaways plus more!\\\nSTREAM - X will allow Decentral Comedy to introduce DCL as a platform to new comedians and be an opportunity to onboard top comedians into the space through a medium they are familiar with - podcasts.\n\nComedians are not known to be very tech savvy, so they too need a proven concept to see the potential. Our programming helps bridge the gap between what Zoom shows lacked in audience engagement but to onboard comedians to this platform they need to be shown that what we do isn't just your average Zoom show - it truly is an interactive production!\nSTREAM - X will create a resident podcast studio in our Decentral Comedy club for USERS to access and have an opportunity to use the space.  This will also be a space for comedians to use freely for future podcasts/events use once they fall in love with the DCL experience.\nThis festival will also serve as the launch pad for Decentral Comedy’s new original show/content combining comedy and the metaverse called Metaversus Mike, featuring one of the most poplar comics at the Mic Drop festival – MIKE WILMOT – shows images and feedback about MIKE.  This will be a Pilot project with 7 original episodes, the first of which debuting at the Stream-X Festival. (See attached document below)\n\nTo date Decentral Comedy has been a self-funded start-up wanting to prove to the users of Decentraland that WE ARE comedy in the Metaverse.  Delivering content at the highest level we are aiming to enhance the user experience to DCL through this new flagship Decentral Comedy project.\n\nFrom supporting our grant application Decentraland users, landowners, mana holders and developers will see:\n•\tAn amazing and fun experience for the community itself\n•\tPromotion and onboarding of new comics and through these comics, we will be able to tap into their massive engaged fanbases to generate new users\n•\tDevelopment of our podcast studio\n•\tDevelopment of pilot episode of Metaversus Mike\n•\tDevelopment of onboarding tools such as video step by step guide\n•\tWebsite/Marketing/Promotion\n•\tThe genesis of consistent comedy content regularly streaming into Decentraland\n\nPlease see: FULL PROPOSAL ATTACHED: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1znI61fWumhjn_ri6AwOuUXuDK1ZED_mx/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Decentral Comedy team will be utilizing our in real life relationships that we have built in the industry to onboard top tier talent with large, dedicated followings into the metaverse. We will be working with our video/audio production partners to create simple, easy to follow instructional material for talent to be able to participate not just in this event but in the future whether that be a simulcast of their content or in avatar form. Our aim is to bring influential people into the space so that they continue to develop within this new way connecting with comedy fans. We will be strategically onboarding talent who have a large heavily engaged fanbase that we can educated and convert into users. This talent also serves as the marketing due to their podcasts being major platforms. As we are very in tune with this part of the industry, we are confident that we can make it work two-fold not just in terms of getting big names into the space but having them become spokespeople for the project.\n\nWe will be employing experienced developers to create the space for the Stream-X events so that it is the optimal user experience for viewing/listening as well as interacting with festival talent. The studio space will then serve as a legacy space for the Decentral Comedy project to stream continuous content for users in Decentraland to enjoy and interact with. We will be working with DCL Connect to produce uninterrupted high-quality streams of the content that way users have the best possible entertainment without buffering and resolution issues.\n\nWe will be working with talent, writers, and productions teams to create customized original content for the festival and beyond that is relatable and fun for the Decentraland Community.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nOur team has over 20+ years hosting comedy festivals and producing shows with top-tier comedy talent from across North America. DC has established itself as the premium comedy entertainment provider throughout Decentraland since June of 2021.  We have developed a strong network of comedians, comedy clubs, recording labels, studios, and live IRL venues to attract talent in to DCL and proven we can do it.\nOur team:\nTyler Morrison  - 20 years of standup comedy and performance/production to the organization.

    "body": "> by 0xa87d168717538e86d71ac48baccaeb84162de602 (cryptonico#e602)\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis is a follow-up from this [past proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7af34c90-5d1e-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7), where a Grant was given by the DAO to keep Polygon transactions in Decentraland free for all its users. Free transactions mean that Decentraland users do not have to pay gas for each meta-transaction they perform (in Polygon) while using the product. This leads to a better UX and lowers the barrier of entry since we subsidize the costs and reduce the number of interactions with the wallet for day-to-day activities such as listing and buying wearables, placing bids and accepting them, publishing wearables, etcetera.\n\nDecentraland has been using **[Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/)**, a meta-transaction relayer, to provide free transactions in Polygon since the **[launch](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor)** of user-generated collections in Polygon on June 1, 2021. Biconomy works by providing us with a personalized **gas tank that we need to fill to cover the cost of the meta-transactions.**\n\n### Solution\n\nUp until now, the gas tank was filled with funds coming from different Grants asked from the community and provided by the DAO. This time, the proposal is to **establish an ongoing mechanism to maintain the gas tank full over time.** As the community is growing and more transactions are taking place, it’s important to keep it full in favor of the whole community and for the sake of Decentraland’s growth.\n\nIt’s important to consider that there is an **economically sustainable model behind this proposal**, the fees extracted from transactions in the Marketplace, Builder, and other dApps are the second most important source of income for the DAO. The numbers are public and can be seen in the Income dashboard on the [Transparency](https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/) section in the DAO Governance dApp.\n\nThe Decentraland Marketplace generates around USD 250,000 per month in profits, this income would cover the cost of the meta-transactions and keep the flywheel spinning: better UX > more transactions > more income for the DAO. If the DAO stops covering the costs of the meta-transactions, then users will need to pay for them to perform almost any action in the dApps, this would discourage people from uploading wearables, bidding, and making transactions in the marketplace. In the end, it would result in less income for the DAO that could be redistributed in the form of Grants and a worse user experience for the Decentraland community.\n\nIf this proposal closes and the result is \"YES\", it will be promoted to a Draft proposing the DAO Committee to be in charge of swapping Mana for Matic to fill the gas tank in the Biconomy platform, making sure it has always enough Matic to support free meta-transactions in Decentraland.\n\n- Yes: Authorize the DAO Committee to continuously refund the meta-transactions gas tank\n- No: Do not continuously refund the meta-transactions gas tank\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d958c3e0-c278-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4)**",

We have thrown multiple parties with 1000-2000 ppl online.    We have made a few wearables for DCL.  One Chibi Hoodie, One pair of Chibi Shoes.  We also added Chibi Ape #2 as a Skin accessory and dropped that all of our holders via Bizzle Wear.   Tonight we are uploading 4 more skins to the Wearable marketplace.  We'd love to explore linked wearables given that all of our traits have been made generatively in 3d art.\n\n\n## Smart Contract Addresses\n\n- 0xC49a9AB342b6ea66792D4110e9cA0ab36e3a5674\n- 0x5AEb2a703323F69b20F397BCB7B38610EC37237b\n- 0x4Ef0Fe82B42B6104BbcEB69E764AbD2050aCfdd4\n- 0x65922260237378b75Fd2FEf9f6236ab1dD5776AA\n\n\n## Manager Addresses\n\n- 0xc4cac68F2cE80c328dAbCfEE4BEBC48ca34B66E6\n- 0xD457adC3B0C658063e2e445b0ab07D2110e715e1\n- 0xAc0B0CD0268B5A9166De11A94E931E8e0cAD1DbB\n\n\n## Is this collection generated programmatically?\n- Yes\n\n\n## Method\n\n3D Models created in blender, then programmatically generated with python scripts.\n\nWe would start with Chibi Apes as our first collection with Linkedin Wearables.  134 assets (or 3D modeled traits).\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b6b64630-c0c2-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4)**",

As a Web3 project we want to take our community beyond the confines of a Discord server and have selected Decentraland as our metaverse home.\n\nOur Decentraland CatBlox HQ was designed by the legendary Tino Schaedler, known best as art director of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince and virtual set designer of V for Vendetta, Charlie and Chocolate Factory, and more.\n\nAt this metaverse location within Decentraland we plan to host community events for our members celebrating our seasons and brand collaborators, such as a PUMA-branded event in the near future.

Each one is unique with its own set of characteristics. There are 20 models and 20 different skins for each. The collection was initially launched on Opensea's shared storefront contract in February of 2021. In May 2021 we began the migration of the collection to its own ERC721 contract on Polygon.\n\nThe 3D avatars are very low poly at about 1500 triangles each and delivered as .glb files which are fully compatible with Decentraland. They are fully rigged and animated and interactive characters which can be brought to life in AR and VR. Probably the first of its kind to ever be released.\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n400\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nSee the deployer wallet is the same as the submitter and elected manager. https://polygonscan.com/token/0x5a5b205e68a8c2b21d98405da6b1b8f018329aef\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nI love Decentraland. It was my first Metaverse experience and also my first foray into NFTs in mid 2020. Our team built a 36 Land Estate (6x6) for Pranksy and after that I was hooked on Decentraland. The wearables available at the time were just not cutting it and I immediately realized we need new avatars.\n\nOur vision was to create full body avatars that would replace the current avatars entirely. Although that was not possible at the time, we still got to work on it with the expectations that this program would eventually be created and we would one day be able to use our own avatars in Decentraland.\n\nThe time has finally come when Manabot can roam free in Decentraland.\n\n\n## Smart Contract Address\n\n- 0x5a5b205e68a8c2b21d98405da6b1b8f018329aef\n\n\n## Manager Address\n\n- 0xADDaF99990b665D8553f08653966fa8995Cc1209\n\n\n## Is this collection generated programmatically?\n- No\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7b3f2260-bf65-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4)**",

The purpose of The Uncensored Library is to deliver information to the public, avoiding suppression by governmental systems.\n\nAlready a globally renowned project which empowered over 25 million people; the recreation of the Uncensored Library’ in Decentraland is being seen as the next logical step in the project’s maturity. In making the Uncensored Library accessible in the metaverse, Reporters Without Borders will be able to actively lower the barriers to entry for censored citizens to access politically critical information, whilst further empowering censored journalists by widening their potential audience.\n\nInformation about the Project:\n\nSince its creation, The Uncensored Library has reported a media reach of 2.7 Billion and has established itself as a grassroots movement that benefits citizens across the globe, all with a media budget of €0.\n\nOverall, The Uncensored Library has reached more than 25 million gamers from 165 different countries, many of them suffering from censorship (including all target countries). As of 2021, the project had amassed over 17 years of accumulative playing time from individual players who spent countless hours inside the library reading politically censored books and articles by independent investigative journalists.\n\nWhy should we build this in Decentraland?\n\nAs outlined in Decentraland’s Code of Ethics, DCL strives to be a safe space for internet users, where all operations and transactions in Decentraland are rooted in a standard conduct of honesty, integrity, and openness, with a rigid desire to respect the human rights and interests of all involved parties in the space.\n\nThe Uncensored Library is a project which aims to fight against centralized authoritarian entities which actively disregard the rights, freedoms, and opinions of their citizens. The work done by Reporters Without Borders in the fight for truth and transparency in countries riddled by corruption and inequalities is admirable, and Web 3.0 can offer such organizations with new solutions in the fight against human rights violations.\n\nOne of the founding principles and solutions brought by Web 3.0 is the effective fight against corrupt, untransparent centralized authorities, and bringing the ‘digital home of press freedom’ to Decentraland is a smart way of signaling to the world that the Metaverse is so much more than just a place for celebrities to host concerts or for brands to sell NFTs.\n\nPress Mentions:\n\nhttps://www.adweek.com/agencies/the-uncensored-library-using-minecraft-as-a-home-for-press-freedom-wins-adc-top-honors/\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/13/tech/minecraft-uncensored-library-scli-intl/index.html\n\nhttps://analyticsindiamag.com/beyond-gaming-how-techies-and-designers-are-using-minecraft-for-its-ubiquitousness%EF%BF%BC/\n\nhttps://www.webbyawards.com/news/mediamonks-winner-stories-the-uncensored-library/\n\nhttps://tcrn.ch/38PXG5X\n\nhttps://gizmodo.com/this-minecraft-library-provides-a-platform-for-censored-1842298748\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo begin this project, Metaverse Architects began bringing all the different stakeholders required to make this project a reality together. After extensive meetings, a way forward was agreed regarding how to branch this project into Decentraland, whilst securing a property of its deployment, and a means to replicate the experience in DCL.\n\nOne key part of this project is to ensure there is no expense on an NGO such as Reporters Without Borders, however, this grant is not just a means of ensuring the whole project can kick-off, but also an opportunity for the community to highlight what we stand for, whilst promoting our grant schemes with the large amount of Press that will catch up on this project.\n\nMetaverse Architects shall be leading the bulk of the development, where we shall repurpose BlockWork's Minecraft design for it to work in Decentraland. This would require an ideation phase, where the build must be tweaked to work in DCL.\n\nYou can find the current Minecraft design here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBI7-pL52GY\\&t=1s\n\nOnce the architecture is complete, another key part of the project, which would require some time to complete, is the migration of the entire digital collection of articles and books found in The Uncensored Library. Moreover, we would have to design a means to be able to access these articles and books in an easy-to-use and easy-to-read UI, which shall be another key part of the development.\n\nFinally, the marketing stage of the project shall be coupled with deployment. This will be a crucial part of the project, as we want to ensure we bring as many eyes on Decentraland as possible with this build.\n\nTo do this, we will organize a launch event with Reporters Without Borders, which will have a multitude of different speakers on different topics, such as press freedom, cyber warfare, decentralization, and the overall impact of Web 3.0. This event will also bring a considerable amount of press awareness due to the partners involved. One key aspect of this event can also be the potential impact of DAOs on society, with the aim being to raise more awareness on the Decentraland DAO as a tech case study, highlighting how it decentralizes decision-making and empowers DCL users to fund projects and movements they believe in.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThis momentous undertaking is a collaborative effort between:\n\n*   Reporters without Borders\n*   DDB Berlin\n*   Metaverse Architects\n*   Metaverse Group\n*   Tokens.com\n*   BlockWorks\n*   Media.Monks\n\nEach organization contributes crucial elements to the project.\n\nMore info:\n\nReporters without Borders promote and defend the freedom to be informed and to inform others throughout the world.\n\nDoyle Dane Bernbach Berlin (DDB) is a leading advertising firm dedicated to supporting The Uncensored Library’s mission.\n\nMetaverse Architects are an innovative design and event planning firm, specializing in 3D modeling and game development across multiple metaverses. Their in-house team will recreate The Uncensored Library in DCL.\n\nThe Metaverse Group are leaders in real estate acquisition, real estate development and property management. Backed by Tokens.com, they boast a robust portfolio of virtual real estate in every major block-chain based metaverse.\n\nBlockWorks is an acclaimed design studio and consultancy firm. Their original design for The Uncensored Library Minecraft build will be replicated in DCL.\n\nMedia.Monks is a disruptive digital production company whose efforts will help drive public awareness of press censorship on behalf of The Uncensored Library.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe Uncensored Library will be a multi-stage development that will follow a 6 month timeline, broken into three key stages.\n\nThe first stage, encompassing a maximum of the first two months, shall be the ideation phase, which will include:\n\n*   The repurposing of designs from Minecraft into Decentraland,\n\n*   The planning of the space, and overall ideation of the library space,\n\n*   The active ideation phase for the utility behind the library, which will also include the potential ideation of the digital infrastructure required for building NFT-funding projects for censored journalists\n\nThe second stage is the development phase, which is projected to take a maximum of three months, and shall include:\n\n*   The development of the library, which shall include a fully-fledged Uncensored Library built for the Decentraland space,\n*   The transferring of data and information from the Minecraft space into the Decentraland space,\n*   The development of a seamless experience for citizens to access censored data in Decentraland, which will act as an empowering tool for citizens with limited access to rights.\n\nThe third stage of the project is the deployment phase, which is projected to take one month, and shall include:\n\n*   The marketing of the project on leading press sites,\n*   The deployment of the property,\n*   An event, with reporters without borders, for the library launch.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=efddde80-bf1b-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4)**",

Most often this occurs in the form of fraudulent links in private messages or in the DCL Discord channel that lead to fake collections on Opensea or an offer to verify the account and sign a fraudulent transaction.All this results in a negative experience related to Decentraland.

The ENS token claim window is set to close on May 3rd, 2022, so this is a time-sensitive action.\n\nENS granted ERC-20 tokens to early adopters of ENS depending on quantity and length held.

The DAO may eventually decide to (a) liquidate tokens and convert to Mana/ETH or other currency for which it has liabilities denominated in, (b) use them to subsidize future ENS needs of the DAO (e.g. dcl.eth comes up for renewal in 2023) or (c) to participate in voting in the ENS DAO.\n\nThe intention of this poll is to decide whether they should be claimed before the opportunity to do so expires.\n\n- Claim ENS Tokens\n- Do not claim ENS Tokens\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f6840cd0-bce3-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4)**",

They are the representation of the holders physicals and 3d assets we have provided them.  The collections I have made for them, are for the collectors to sell or leverage to their communities. My concept is to collaborate with different communities and onboard them into DCL via their own NFTs.\n\nThis new ability DCL has offered brings alot more options to the table and our future with fashion in this space. I would love for example at first to be able to load a special 1/1 wearable attached to the 3d assets of the owners seen in z1nkxholderz. I think they would find that pretty nifty.\n\nBut in the near future when we do our clothing drops, this option in a generative collection would fit perfectly.\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n1\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nI would have to provide each person with their IP.\nOnly half of the 3d assets have been completed.\nWe are only a small team, not all things are completed but would love to see these owners have their own pairs in DCL. If you click on them you will see a few founders as owners and things that are also interested in their own collections in DCL and are working with us to create them as you may be able to see on our DCL page.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nI want to have my wearables in DCL as this offers the perfect evolution to my journey and story. Briefly we create physical custom shoes for NFT collectors.\nBut as we want to dive into the digital realm, these digital items need utility.\nBeing able to be worn is exactly what a shoe known for. These things make sense to the outside world more so and help us onboard newer people to NFTs that at least can do something they understand. I believe in interoperability and we need to connect all scenes to each other. I spend more time in the PFP nft community spaces, and feel its out of touch with amazing places like DCL.

    "body": "> by 0x0a22698f14d20f40a228bfb6cbab4ce425556c95\n\nShould CFO's AKA Creative Freedom Officer's be added to the Linked Wearables Registry?\n\n## Relevant Links\n\n- https://rarible.com/user/0x0A22698F14D20F40A228BfB6cbab4cE425556C95\n- https://creativefreedomofficers.com/\n\n\n## NFT Collections Description\n\nOur first CFO collection was created to embody proud and powerful women serving our mission. We diversified our CFOs of all races, including skin conditions. CFO #4 was particularly special for bringing awareness to vitiligo. CFOs promote inclusivity of all women, which was embodied in our second collection when we created handicapped women as CFOs. Our second collection tied the whole essence of all the past and future collections.  No matter where a holder is in the world, including handicapped individuals that may be limited, you can make an impact. CFOs are meant to make an impact.\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n1\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nProject Accounts\nhttps://twitter.com/CFONFT\nhttps://www.instagram.com/cfonft/\nhttps://creativefreedomofficers.com/\nhttps://rarible.com/user/0x0A22698F14D20F40A228BfB6cbab4cE425556C95\n\nOwner Account\nhttps://twitter.com/whoisdivina\n\nAll links are represented and shared in each account. On both the project and owner Twitter accounts, I will pin a tweet stating \"proof\" to provide proof of ownership. I will also do the same with the verified Rarible account.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCFO AKA Creative Freedom Officers are meant to be a symbol of positivity and change in Web3. CFOs promote and protect freedom involving creativity, opinion, and self-expression. CFO's first priority is to protect against subjective censorship. Having a 'CFO' on the shoulder of an avatar would symbolize that the avatar and individual support expression in an objective manner, with open arms and without judgment. Representation of a CFO in Decentraland would also compliment the DAO for its true democratic values. CFO's believe in objective standpoints as opposed to subjective opinions with agendas. We believe that all individuals should act and express themselves freely in correlation to the laws of human nature.\n\n\n## Smart Contract Address\n\n- 0x0A22698F14D20F40A228BfB6cbab4cE425556C95\n\n\n## Manager Address\n\n- 0x0A22698F14D20F40A228BfB6cbab4cE425556C95\n\n\n## Is this collection generated programmatically?\n- No\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8056fc30-bb43-11ec-8561-b591bf2cf0d0)**",

This will be integrated into the interoperable https://metaverse-events.xyz/ website.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe1f5ea171C5690A7Df19c99040248E584371Eabc\n\n## Description\n\nCurrently, finding a POI in Decentraland requires you to open the DCL Map, and move across a 2D interface to see what you can potentially experience.\n\nThe few access points that exist in DCL (like the ones in Genesis Plaza) don't fully capture the vast amounts of POIs that already exist in Decentraland.\n\nWe wish to change this.\n\nBy scraping data from the DCL DAO votes, and by getting users to travel across the DCL Map, we want to create a database of all the current existing POIs in Decentraland, and minimally add them into an upcoming events hub called https://metaverse-events.xyz/ . The data-scraping will ensure that we can continue updating the site with newly approved POIs.\n\nThis will eventually allow us to connect events being organised in POI spaces to actual events on the metaverse-events website & the DCL Website. This is just a first step in being able to create a one-stop-shop for all Metaverse Events and meeting points in DCL.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nhttps://metaverse-events.xyz/ is an upcoming project that aims to interoperably promote different events across the Metaverse.\n\nWhilst this is an entirely independent project, we want to start laying out the foundations for POIs to have a more accessible and immersive scope to how the user finds and experiences different points of interest in Decentraland.\n\nThis process will take approximately a 2-3 weeks, where members of our team will begin by outlining all the different POIs in Decentraland, and writing a short description of each POI. These will then be implemented into the Metaverse-Events platform, where users can search, browse and discover different POIs (coupled with tags and descriptions) and jump directly into Decentraland through an easy-to-use UI.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThis project, alongside the mother project https://metaverse-events.xyz/, is being spearheaded by Metaverse Architects, one of the leading Metaverse-Development team in the Metaverse Sector.\n\nMetaverse Architects are an innovative design and event planning firm, specializing in 3D modeling and game development across multiple metaverses. Their in-house team of skilled architects, developers, marketers, and designers are dedicated to building metaverse use cases on a daily basis, and are a one-stop-shop for all your metaverse needs.\n\nYou can find more information on the team here:\nhttps://metaverse-architects.com/\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis project will take 4 weeks to implement, with 2 weeks dedicated to collecting data, refining tags and producing content/information on the POIs. The following two weeks will be dedicated towards ensuring the right implementation and user experience is created for the POI space.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ad7eac90-bac0-11ec-8561-b591bf2cf0d0)**",

    "title": "Interactive mazes, encouraging engagement, and offering support, while earning.",
    "body": "> by 0xf5ce5ff86220743c7b9ed6f9b029237585d511b9\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWould like to create an NFT maze that is community orientated. Currently have over 20 unique mazes, that are designed to encourage user interaction. Idea is based on having users explore a maze, where they can also hang out in a lobby. The lobby will be hosted by companies, where those companies will be able to sell their real world services. Throughout the maze and lobbies, the user can place unique NFT art for consignment sales. Both the Lobby host (company) and NFT art sales would bring in overall revenue for decentraland, by using mana as main source of coin. Lobbies will encourage engagement and interaction. Will also have opportunity for a moderator host to have a booth and answer any maze or decentraland related questions.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xF5Ce5FF86220743c7b9Ed6F9b029237585D511B9\n\n## Description\n\nThe mazes will solve the main problem of people not knowing where to go for help. The maze will be a game design to keep the user engaged and interactive, but will also be there to support the user with answers and guidance by moderators. All new moderators will be assigned different lobbies in different mazes and there can be an infinite number of moderators in any given maze.  Each maze will have keys and tokens to earn while solving puzzles to get to the finish. At any time the user can bounce into the lobby to talk about their progress with others, and/or interact with the business host, or a decentraland moderator. This grant will provide enough Mana to acquire land large enough to host an interactive maze with a few themed lobbies. Mana will also be offered to unique blockchain developers and engineers that believe in the project and want to contribute. Since every maze and lobby will allow users to post nft art on consignment, is imperative to have block chain engineers readily available to assist with troubleshooting any issues. Companies that want to be involved in the project will be required to pay a one time Mana fee, which will include a personalized lobby with brand awareness. They will also be able to sell or offer their product or service for the real world, while the user is in the decentraland lobby. Initial investment will be able to fund full time moderators to be available to walk the mazes and help other users by answering questions and encouraging lobby hang outs. The overall maze will have mana to earn as well as nfts that can be sold for mana.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nI will be the project manager and will be outsourcing the creation to skilled block chain engineers. I have drawn out mazes with different missions and designs, all geared to keep the user busy. At any time, the user can bounce into a lobby to meet the sponsored company and do business with that company (like purchasing insurance or real life product). At same time, user can invest in the lobby by posting unique art for consignment sale. NFT art will be able to be displayed throughout the entire maze, and a potential user can purchase NFT while in the maze and while playing the puzzle or game. This project will be completed by hiring qualified blockchain designer and engineer. This project was designed in my head over 20 years ago when I created these mazes with intention of creating a video game that can earn the user coin while playing. Now we have the technology to make this vision possible.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI currently hold a position with a fortune 100 company in their social media department. Once grant is afforded, I can approach my employer to invest in this space and make me Project Manager for them to start the first lobby.  The company I work for does a lot of commercial advertising and is an innovator in the tech space. Once my employer is in this space, they will be the pioneers and the proof of concept of more large companies to join the band wagon of creating lobbies in the decentraland maze. Then we will have a lobby where our brand will be posted everywhere, which will encourage other companies to jump on board and create their own.  Ideally, the user can go in the maze, and play, interact, and potentially buy things in the lobby, sign up for accounts, insurance, or whatever the lobby host business offers.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nCompany sign up and assigned engineers will happen by August 2022. With first maze & lobby to be launched in time for December 2022.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=54d70e80-b9fc-11ec-8561-b591bf2cf0d0)**",

Jan 2022 -  [Resignation of Eric from the DAO Committee.](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/resignation-from-the-dao-committee/4705)\n\nThe main responsibilities of the DAO Committee are:\n\n*   Moderate proposals in the governance platform (promote to enacted, passed, rejected)\n*   Keep updated the list of POIs, BanNames and Catalysts.\n*   Create and fund vesting contracts for paying grants.\n*   Calculate and execute compensation for the Wearables Curation Committee.\n*   Pay the DAO Facilitator a monthly compensation.\n*   Use the DAO Treasury (release vesting, transfers to operational wallet, swap funds).\n*   Reimburse gas fees to the DAO Committee.\n\nSome other task related to the role are:\n\n*   Attend monthly Town Halls and provide general community support.\n*   Give feedback to proposals, evaluate risks and implementations pathways.\n*   Contact external organizations in the name of the DAO.\n\nSo far we enacted 181 proposals, distributed as follow:\n\n*   81 POIs added\n*   50 grants paid\n*   39 polls were enacted\n*   10 names banned\n*   1 catalyst update\n\nIn the past year I have sent 414 transactions from my  [DAO Committee wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe91C0c482E09600f2d1DBCA10FD705BC6de60bc)  in the name of the DAO. Thanks to the proposal of reimbursement of gas fees, this operation doesn’t have a monetary loss for the committee members. However, each of these transactions required attention to review/sign and **those efforts are not being compensated in any form**. I believe this is a problem for the long-term sustainable operation of the DAO.\n\nAdding to this situation, one of the initial three committee members resigned early this year. It has been hard to find a replacement that can take such a responsibility and willing to do it for free.\n\n**I believe we need to start compensating the DAO Committee members and set the grounds for a sustainable DAO Committee.

    "body": "> by 0xca5b437dbc3c7f441f99c698d4b1fe1aa0599346 (MetaParty)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nFollowing the success of MetaParty hosting the Community Fashion Show at metaverse Fashion Week, our team is committed to helping Decentraland grow. After a series of meetings and planning sessions, we’ve decided the best way to help the community is to engage with new players by making Genesis Plaza a more friendly, interactive, and supportive environment. This will include tours, interactive lessons and welcome events for beginners.\n\nWe’ve created a slide deck presentation to demonstrate our proposal, which can be viewed with the link below:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/37EfFkX\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xdd03f9B8bf0813AD4a5681a4A06A0D85f4169B84\n\n## Description\n\nWe believe that Genesis Plaza is an excellent starting point for new Decentraland players. But new players typically spawn into the metaverse with little clue about the true potential of this platform. Genesis Plaza provides players with numerous options to get involved in Decentraland, yet many remain confused or simply dormant. There needs to be a better and more consistent way to educate players about what’s possible in Decentraland and get them interacting with each other.\n\nMetaParty wants to take full advantage of Genesis Plaza by hosting welcome events, tours, and informative lessons in the numerous spaces available. Our team is experienced hosting fun and lively events, such as MetaVerse Fashion Week, that draw players of all experience levels into the metaverse. Our grant proposal would allow MetaParty to host regular events in Genesis Plaza that encourage players to explore Decentraland, learn about its features, and have fun interactions with other players.\n\nTo accomplish our goal, MetaParty will hire a series of tour guides in multiple languages to assist new players in Decentraland. This process will include accountability measures in which the community can track our progress via a sign-in sheet. MetaParty will train, oversee, and manage these tour guides to ensure quality experiences for new players.\n\nWe’ve created a YouTube video describing the proposal that shows a demo tour, which can be viewed at the link below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHyY8XqKaDg\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe’re proposing the following:\n\nMetaParty staff members are present at Genesis Plaza five days a week Monday through Friday during 12pm UTC to 4pm UTC to give tours, host fun events, and teach new users about Decentraland. Our staff will use a combination of voice and text features to alert new users to join the tour.\n\nThe tour will take place once per hour from 12pm UTC to 4pm UTC and last about 20 minutes, taking new players through the main buildings in Genesis Plaza (outlined below) and use each location to speak about different aspects of Decentraland: NFTs, wearables, land, wearable design and more.\n\nLessons will take place once per shift at 2pm UTC at different venues throughout Genesis Plaza and cover the following: Introduction to Builder, Introduction to Wearable Creation and Introduction to Social Media, Branding and Marketing for Decentraland.\n\nTour outline:\n\nNote: While some buildings in Genesis Plaza are explicitly named, others are unnamed. For the purposes of our tour, we’ve named buildings that lack a name. For a visual representation of each tour stop, please see our video proposal linked above.\n\nAdditionally, we recognize the importance of having tours conducted in multiple languages to reach the worldwide audience coming into Decentraland. Proceeds from the grant will go towards hiring Spanish language tour guides and additional language speakers.\n\nMain Building (0,0) - Quick overview of Decentraland basics; how to run, walk, emote, access backpack and view the main map. Tour guide will talk about Genesis Plaza and proceed to the first tour stop.\n\nLong Building (2,7) - Introduction to how Decentraland runs on MANA, land ownership and the DAO.\n\nAuditorium (7,6) - Introduction to events in Decentraland and discussion on how someone can build a career in the metaverse as a creator, or become established within Decentraland communities.\n\nCircle Building (7,-1) - Discuss how to buy wearables, brief discussion on what kinds of wearables are available and how to use the Decentraland Marketplace. In addition we will briefly cover smart wearables.\n\nTrade Center (6,-7) - Discuss MANA as an asset that can be bought and traded. At this point in the tour we will briefly cover how to set up a MetaMask wallet, and provide links in game to Decentraland content creators videos that go into further detail about MetaMask.\n\nNFT Hallway (-1,-4) - Introduction to NFTs and discussion on the different forms they take in Decentraland.\n\nSocial Building (-2,-9) - Talk about Decentraland social media channels like Twitter and Discord. Briefly discuss the Builder and how it can be used via a link in this area. Furthermore, we will cover Decentraland content creators.\n\nRose Building (-7,7) - The final tour stop will be used to discuss communities in Decentraland that host events and other fun interactive experiences. We will introduce players to the Decentraland Events page. Tour ends with a question and answer portion.\n\nMega-Party - At the end of each month, new users will be invited to a Mega-Party hosted by MetaParty in Genesis Plaza at the auditorium. This party will take place on the last friday of each month at 8pm UTC. It will feature performances from DJs like DJTrax and other performers associated with MetaParty. Special guests from the community will be invited for talks.\n\nLesson Outline:\n\nPlease refer to the PDF document linked below for a full lesson outline.\n\nhttps://bit.ly/377TfJ6\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nRezinator\nFounder, Head of Business Development and Community Management\n\nRezinator leads community management, project development and event hosting/planning for MetaParty. He plays a key role in building partnerships and acquiring sponsorships for the company. Rez has hosted more than one-hundred metaverse events while creating and marketing 10+ MetaParty NFT collections.\n\nRez has a healthy addiction to providing unique and amazing experiences within the metaverse, developing quality relationships with community members and making new connections with future MetaParty partners.\n\nNew Legends\nFounder, Head of Content and Social Media\n\nNew Legends oversees marketing, communications and content production at MetaParty.

In September, each Friday at 5pm UTC MetaParty will host an event with performers, musicians, stand-up comedy and more in Genesis Plaza.\n\nBy the sixth month MetaParty will have hosted 530 unique tours in Genesis Plaza, and we will then submit another grant proposal to continue this work.\n\nAccountability\nTour guides and support members will need to sign a document after every shift, with details about their day's work. In addition we will share images of the tours on the MetaParty Twitter account. New Legends and Rezinator will oversee tour guides and ensure the tours are carried out to a good standard.\n\nNote:\n\nDue to character limitations, we have created a PDF document which you can view with the link below.

    "body": "> by 0x6a77883ed4e65a1df591fda2f5252fd7c548f198 (Fancy)\n\nThe option to price your wearables for fractional MANA does not currently exist on the Marketplace UI, however the smart contract already allows for it.  Would you be in support of updating the Marketplace UI to allow for fractional MANA pricing?\n\nRational\n\n\\*There are over 150 items in the primary market which are listed below 1 MANA.  This eliminates a reasonable resale market.\n\n\\*The small group that already appears to be pricing for fractional mana are mostly item farming accounts/bots.\n\n\\*By opening up the secondary market to lower valued items, it will increase the interest and accessibility to the market.  New users could save for higher valued or more desirable items without having to spend fiat to participate.  Many people cannot afford to purchase MANA, but almost everyone has items they have been given through events or content creator giveaways.\n\n\\*This could potentially SAVE the DAO in matic gas fees by reducing the number of junk listings which never sell, and get relisted by the thousands on a daily basis.  By establishing an actual value, less valuable items may find their way to the end consumer or long term investor faster.\n\nI previously submitted a similar proposal, but didn't take it seriously or put much effort into it.  You can read that here: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=40bb3970-93dd-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a\n\nIf this poll passes the approval threshold, I will open a forum post to discuss concerns and any other type of feedback to make sure this is something everyone approves of.

    "body": "> by 0xaca8fbbdddfce169114f344d8ee739bde665f4f4 (MetaArchs#f4f4)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nMental Health is a growing priority in society, with issues such as anxiety, depression, substance disorders, and sleep disorders rising exponentially every year. We believe that metaverse-based technologies can disrupt a multitude of different industries, including healthcare.\n\nMetaverse Architects and leading mental-health service providers Mind-Easy, shall launch the first-ever mental-health support system in the Metaverse, with the help of Metaverse Group and Tokens.com.\n\nWe aim to pioneer what is possible in DCL, by developing a very first use case in the disruption of traditional healthcare services, by offering free tools, information, and general support to the DCL community in the form of Mental Health provisions and services.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC28f17063d8719AC111857521f49d9Ba90eD28e9\n\n## Description\n\nOur vision is to create an inclusive mental health clinic in the metaverse that will give DCL users access to the tools, videos, and resources to take charge of their mental health. This material will cover a range of mental health issues, and shall be accessible to anyone in Decentraland.\n\nThis will be built on land owned by Metaverse Group, and shall include the creation of an immersive, 3D experience, aimed at providing free, accessibile information on differnet Mental Health provisions.\n\nMoreover, this project will aim to empower users to take charge of their mental health, and we shall prioiritise the formation and developlment of a community which aims to support and nurture the mental health of fellow DCL community members. Mind-Easy shall also work to provide free professional support systems to DCL Members, including free expert calls for DCL Members in the form of 20-minute expert sessions, which shall be given to the first 100 patients on the property looking for additional help and expertise beyond the free, immersive experience.\n\nFor extra inclusivity, the initial project will be designed and built to communicate mental health provisions in three key international languages, being English, Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nIn order to integrate mental health support into the DCL community, the mental health clinic will highlight features such as; virtual therapy, peer support, gamified content, and immersive, 3D educational resources.\n\nThe clinic will also include therapy spaces, sensory immersion experiences, and consciousness exploration spaces, along with peer support hubs and collaborative exercise spaces to foster a positive environment for mental health and wellbeing.\n\nOur primary goal is to leverage the possibilities and potential of the Metaverse to bridge the gaps in the existing mental health spaces. The clinic will be the first step in the creation of an ecosystem for decentralized and equal distribution access to culturally validated mental health resources for all users.\n\nHere, users will be able to engage in expanded experiences such as virtual therapy, peer support, gamified content and educational resources that will contribute to the adoption and expectancy of cultural sensitivity as the minimum standard of mental health care.\nThe clinic will include therapy spaces, sensory immersion experiences and consciousness exploration spaces, along with peer support hubs and collaborative exercise spaces to foster a destigmatized environment for mental health and wellbeing.\n\nOur strategic collaborations with Metaverse Architects, as well as the enormous network of researchers, psychologists, and therapists specialized in the unique needs of users allows us to create content and design spaces with every need of the user at the forefront of our development process.\n\nWe are currently in the early design phase of hashing out the aesthetics of these spaces to make them feel as engaging and calming as possible. Additionally, the clinic will integrate an already existing and previously approved grant project DCL Connect which will allow mental-health professionals to actively manage this space with minimal barriers to entry. This will facilitate the provision of cutting-edge DCL experiences for the Decentraland community, and shall allow our project to provide even more value to the space.\n\nThe scope of creating mental health spaces within the metaverse is quite literally endless but we want to begin this journey within Decentraland by focusing first on the unique needs of the users. Our long-term vision includes scaling to incorporate events, NFT creations, dynamic building of scenes and exclusive content.\nBy doing this, we aim to further promote and encourage the adoption and use of Decentraland with the idea of making it the first metaverse platform to create engagement and traction for inclusive mental wellbeing\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThis project is a collaborative endeavor between Mind-Easy, Metaverse Architects and The Metaverse Group.\n\nMind-Easy offers a refreshing approach to mental health: it aims to take the totality of the individual into account and presents tailored therapy that promotes healing, growth and empowerment.

We have a passionate community of holders who are champing at the bit to get their helmets into DCL and start exploring. We launched the project in October of 2021, and since then we've built this community around our stellar design as well as our mission to create wearables you can take anywhere in the metaverse - unique avatars you can maintain across metaverses as your \"perma-identity.\" Linked wearables in DCL is integral to that vision! We've purchased 6 plots of land in DCL and are launching a massive HQ for the project in a few short weeks where we'll host tons of awesome events, quests, and game for our holders!\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n5669\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nHere is a screenshot showing proof of having admin access to the Metaverse Travel Agency Opensea collection:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/g39t5kw2r5vszdg/IMAGE%202022-04-08%2015%3A01%3A13.jpg?dl=0\n(you can see up at the top of the page the options to \"Add Item\" and edit the page, which only admins would be able to see)\n\nAnd a screenshot of proof of having access to a Kollectiff email account:\nhttps://capture.dropbox.com/Lhz3smeBl6TfjzpH\n\nHere are screenshots of proof of having access to the MTA Twitter account (@theMTAofficial) and admin access to the MTA Discord:\nhttps://capture.dropbox.com/VmhSgOSsNTIKpSJN\nhttps://capture.dropbox.com/Rw6xQ4vkBtQ0fiAc\nhttps://capture.dropbox.com/ZntrcUUbZdlvP0Hp\nhttps://capture.dropbox.com/ZntrcUUbZdlvP0Hp\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nKollectiff is a Web3 design brand that's been partnered with Decentraland since our inception. We're dedicated to creating unique wearables and interactive experiences that you can bring anywhere in the metaverse. We partnered with DCL for the fashion festival in March where we built \"The Metaloop\" - a fashion runway event that featured dozens of quality digital fashion brands (Perry Ellis, IKKS, Anrealage, Cider, DressX, and more). We helped these brands build their DCL wearables and bring them onto the platform. We also built Acura's DCL HQ which just launched. We plan to bring more big brands into DCL, and we'd love to have the opportunity to bring our own wearable NFT collection in a continued collaboration with the DCL community!\n\n\n## Smart Contract Address\n\n- 0xBD888e50969748805cDF77bCF283fEbE493f190c\n\n\n## Manager Address\n\n- 0x468cCd8Cda9D4f9414a41220F6B08E8d5E9F3D16\n\n\n## Is this collection generated programmatically?\n- Yes\n\n\n## Method\n\nWe used our proprietary software to programmatically generate our collection using more than 100 traits. The repository is private and cannot be shared.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=3d158ae0-b788-11ec-903a-6546e8793cef)**",

    "body": "> by 0xa87d168717538e86d71ac48baccaeb84162de602 (cryptonico#e602)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Final definitions for Linked Wearables](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f69c4d40-aaaf-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231)\n\n## Summary\n\nA proposed implementation for the submission, approval, and in-world representation of third-party NFTs as wearables.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis project will onboard new communities to Decentraland, add new uses to other NFT projects, and be an experiment in NFT interoperability.\n\nThe following solution requires the original creators of an NFT project to apply to the DAO to be “registered” within Decentraland. Approved third parties will be able to upload the 3D assets needed to represent their NFTs as Wearables in Decentraland.\n\nThis is one more step of a long process, below theres is a list of the proposals involved:\n\n1.  [Original proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)\n2.  [Submission fees](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=90a67ae0-7320-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)\n3.  [Programmatic collections](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=83351b70-a0a0-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a)\n4.  [Final definitions for Linked Wearables](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f69c4d40-aaaf-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWeb3 has given people more agency over their digital identities and the assets they own, but as more people purchase art from NFT projects, there is an increasing desire to bring these assets into other corners of the metaverse. In short, people want the ability to don their NFTs as wearables when navigating through Decentraland.\n\nThe goal of this project is to **onboard existing communities to Decentraland**, and make them feel welcome by customizing their avatar with their already existing NFTs and giving collectors the chance to express their PFP persona inside Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Linked Wearables are 3D representations of NFTs outside Decentraland** that can be used as wearables in-world, can be equipped on the avatar, and are found in the backpack.\n\nLinked Wearables are not **[regular wearables](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/wearables-overview/)**. They look the same, but they carry a completely different meaning. **They can not be bought or sold in Decentraland’s Marketplace.**\n\n**These are the steps that Third Parties need to follow to have Linked Wearables:**\n\n1.  **Create a DAO proposal** in the category **“Linked Wearables Registry”** to be accepted as an approved Third Party, then the tool will be available.\n2.  Wait one week for DAO's approval and pass the 4M VP threshold.\n3.  **Submit wearables** in the **Builder** using the available Slots.\n4.  Develop the API following [this specification](https://github.com/decentraland/adr/blob/main/docs/ADR-42-third-party-assets-integration.md#third-party-resolver).\n5.  Wait for Curators Committee approval.\n6.  Spread the word! Tell your community that they can **enjoy their brand new Linked Wearables inside Decentraland**.\n\n**Application Process**\n\nThird parties will create a DAO proposal in the category “Linked Wearables Registry” to be accepted in the registry. The vote will last for a week and will require a minimum threshold of participation of 4M VP.\n\nThe inclusion of the third party into the Registry will be done by the DAO Committee. This process will create slots for the third party and enable access to the publication flow.\n\n**Slots**\n\nA Slot is a potential representation of an NFT as a Decentraland Wearable. They define the maximum amount of different wearables designs the Third Party can use.\n\nDepending on the strategy the collection owners choose, they can request 1 slot (i.e. All holders of the NFT collection will get the same Linked Wearable) or multiple slots (i.e. If the collection has 7,777 NFTs they can request for 7,777 slots to match the wearable with the NFTs look & feel)\n\nSlots are free and requested by third parties on their application. They can later request more slots if necessary.\n\n**Wearable Submission**\n\nThe Third Party will be able to use the Builder tool to submit a wearable design for each Slot. The wearable model must follow the same specs as any regular wearables and will be subject to the curation process of the Wearable Curation Committee.\n\n**API Development**\n\nOnce the wearables are submitted to review the third party must create an API that resolves the assignment between NFT owners and Decentraland Wearables.\n\nThis is a scalable and cross-chain solution to accommodate different scenarios. The API might assign the same wearable for every NFT holder; or different wearables for different groups of NFT holders; or even more, a unique design for each NFT holder.\n\n**Curation Process**\n\nThe Wearable Curation Committee will curate the submitted wearables as part of their regular flow. The curation fees are covered by the DAO and will be the same amount as regular wearables, so for a curator, it shouldn’t matter what type of collection it is.\n\nFor Programmatic Collections with more the 50 items, the curation won’t review each design one by one, instead, a new curation process will be executed following these general guidelines:\n\n1.  Audit the wearable generation process.\n2.  Define a curation plan based on the process.\n3.  Curate 1% of the collection (min 50, max 300).\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nLinked Wearables will enable NFT Communities to customize their avatar in Decentraland. This is beneficial for both parties because the **NFTs get a new use case** (adding value to the collection and the community) and also, new users will be exposed to Decentraland’s experience.\n\nThis proposal will create a new flow of publication of wearables that might compete with the current publication process. This issue is mitigated by several factors:\n\n1.  **Third Parties need to be approved by the DAO** in order to use this publication flow.\n2.  The NFTs associated with **these wearables can’t be traded in Decentraland’s marketplace.**\n3.  Third-party need their own NFT smart contract and build/maintain a public API for the integration to work.\n\nThe DAO will not receive submission fees for this process but still cover the compensation of the Wearable Curator Committee, thus increase DAO’s expenses. However, with the current situation of the DAO treasury this shouldn’t be a limitation, and instead see it as a marketing investment.\n\nThe Linked Wearables project will also incentivize the wearable creation economy, generating more jobs for 3d designers and studios with experience in Decentraland. The NFT communities won’t pay the DAO a submission fee but will invest resources in those with knowledge in the craft of wearable making.\n\nExpected upsides:\n\n*   Onboard many NFT communities to Decentraland.\n*   Become a case study about interoperability between NFT projects.\n\nUndesirable (but possible) outcomes:\n\n*   Communities might not gather enough VP to be listed in the Linked Wearables Registry.\n*   Implementation and maintenance of integration might be costly for members of the Linked Wearables Registry.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe implementation of this feature involves the following applications:\n\n*   Governance dApp.\n    *   Enable the external NFT communities to propose themselves for the registry.\n\n*   Linked Wearables Registry - A new dApp to manage the registry.\n    *   DAO Committee Members can add new members to the registry.\n    *   DAO Committee Members can manage available slots for registry members.\n    *   Registry members can update their managers and resolver API.\n\n*   Builder Tool\n    *   Managers of the communities listed on the Linked Wearable Registry will be able to create collections using their available slots and submit them to review.\n    *   Wearable Curation Committee will review the collections and upload the content to the catalysts network upon approval.\n\n*   Third-party API\n    *   This is an external API maintained by the third parties in Linked Wearables Registry.\n    *   It enables the mapping between NFT owners and submitted wearables.\n\n*   World Explorer:\n    *   Wearables linked to external NFTs will be displayed in the explorer's backpack.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis should be a very inclusive feature that allows many communities to know Decentraland and everything it has to offer. We, as a community, also need to welcome them and make it easy to access but at the same time, secure. Please vote 😄.\n\n**Voting Options**\n\n**In favor:** Approve Linked Wearables Project\n\n**Against:** Reject Linked Wearables Project\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5534b120-b786-11ec-903a-6546e8793cef)**",

    "body": "> by 0x0add22fc4f8a32890b8d2b87bba386fe007a0d5e (Anouk#0d5e)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe purpose of this project is to allow smaller creators of NFTs/wearables to get a chance to display their talents and to reach a greater customer base. The project will consist of a plot of land where a building will be constructed which will allow smaller/entry level creators to showcase/advertise their work.   Advertising on this plot will be free for a given time duration of one week, after which a small payment will have to be made in mana/matic.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n21,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x0aDd22fc4F8A32890B8d2b87BBA386Fe007a0D5E\n\n## Description\n\nWith the concept of the Meta-verse  growing ever more popular, some very talented creators are going unnoticed. That is why i plan on giving people the chance to advertise for free and the first step to the plan is obtaining  a plot of land. Hopefully this grant will allow me to do so and execute the remainder of the plan. I plan on having a small section dedicated for holding events however that space will have to be rented and the price will vary depending on the demand for the space. The main building will be segmented into smaller stalls and one stall will be given to each person who is interested in advertising on the plot. The exterior regions of the building will also have billboards put up for further advertising. Depending on the success of the first section of the project, i aim to expand this project and make advertising plots available through out the map.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nBasic advertising through stalls inside the building will be free of charge for a time period\nof 1 week, after which a payment of $5 will have to be made per day. Each stall will allow\nthe advertiser  to display their work where ever they please to do so, however it cannot\nexceed the boundaries  of the stall.\n\nThe billboards on the outskirts of the building will be free of charge for a time period of 2 days. After which a payment of $10 will have to be made a day. Each billboard will be of a certain size but special orders/requirement’s  for billboards can be made and the prize will vary according to the needs.\n\nThe event venue on the premises will be available to rent and the price will be $50 per hour. The venue will give access to a screen and you also have the option to get the venue set up according to your needs ( however keep in mind that no changes to the structure of the building or stage area can be made). If you intend on holding a music event then please note that we will only be providing the venue, (music personals will not be included in the package).\n\nFurthermore, creators who are interested in advertising will have to Direct Message me after which i will be adding them to a  waitlist. Depending on the demand for advertising space, advertisers may have to wait for a minimum  of one week. A potion of the money earned  through this project will go towards helping the community and smaller creators.\n\nAlso note that the value of the grant requested is a bit higher than the actual requirement , but this is to ensure that i have enough for the completion of the project. I am more than happy to return any excess money back to the DAO if they approve of it. All spendings will be recorded and made public through various platforms for anyone to view to avoid accusation of foul play. You are also welcome to ask me any further enquiries of yours through twitter.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nAs of now i will be the only member of this project. However, i intend to hire other talented 3D creators to improve and maintain the property.  If you have any further inquiries please DM me on twitter @Anouk_T2005 .\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nSTAGE 1- Creation of the building   and setting  up of stalls within along with advertising boards.\n\nSTAGE 2- Opening of the waitlist for advertising spots.\n\nSTAGE 3- maintaining of the space.\n\nSTAGE 4- Further expansions.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f3b37570-b6f5-11ec-903a-6546e8793cef)**",

Castle Crew www.castlecrews.com they will be 2 million unique generated princesses that we can make as 1. back of shield 2. tatoo 3. full body characters of each\n\nAll this aside open to anything you guys think!\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n4998\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nhttps://trademark.trademarkia.com/waifumon-90628220.html\nhttps://trademarks.justia.com/905/26/castle-90526188.html\n\nAlso all shapes, and other names are trademarked or copyright and case numbers and file dates can be shared upon request.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nI don't know where to begin. We have sold thousands of NFTs and have even given out over 71,000 promo NFTs so far daily to the decentraland community. We are in love with the Decentraland metaverse as most players already know. We continue to grow daily on twitter and already invite them to our Waifumon parties in Decentraland and other Metavereses like Sandbox. Everyone asks us all the time they wish there NFTs could be cross platformed to all metaverses and I think this finally the first step. Would be honored to be apart of this history so open to pivot or change anything we need to do so to make it happen.

    "title": "Add GUNKDUMP to the Linked Wearables Registry",
    "body": "> by 0x3b67727b341b5a12043f8fa13be67897b98e5a2f (GUNKDUMP#5a2f)\n\nShould GUNKDUMP be added to the Linked Wearables Registry?\n\n## Relevant links\n\n- https://www.instagram.com/gunkdump\n- https://www.twitter.com/GUNKDUMP_HQ\n\n\n## NFT Collection(s) description\n\nStarting off with the already published wearable GUNKDUMP HELMET, this piece represents the helmet of a graphic illustration I designed that serves as the brand's mascot, the Dead Astronaut. This astronaut can be found around the social media accounts as itself or printed on clothing, and depicts an ominous astronaut with a burning helmet and symbolic 'G' as the head. I had planned on accumulating more MANA to publish the rest of the astronaut's outfit. The next one would be a matching animated playing card NFT on opensea, Dead Astronaut 'Hearts' Card. Alongside that card is the card of 'Nemesis Astronaut' which I had planned to also publish as an outfit wearable which includes a rival antagonist astronau, Nemesis Astronaut 'Spades' Card.\n\n\n## Governance\n\nMy name is Armen Tsatou and I am the rightful owner to GUNKDUMP. I created www.gunkdump.com and manage all of the social media accounts. My website is www.armentsatou.com, instagram is @guply, and if any other information or confirmation is needed I will gladly give it.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nI am the CEO and sole proprietor of streetwear label GUNKDUMP. For the past year and a half, GUNKDUMP has entered the web3 space and numerous NFT collectables have been minted including a helmet wearable based off of one of the main designs, published months ago. I had wished for another way to add more representation of the brand into Decentraland, while not having enough funds to mint another wearable, and this is the perfect opportunity for just that. The 3D designer that I had commissioned for the wearable had already made a few glb files of IRL GUNKDUMP clothing and designs that I would most definitely like to have manifested into linked wearables.\n\n\n## Smart Contract Addresses\n\n- 0xB549B2442b2BD0a53795BC5cDcBFE0cAF7ACA9f8\n- 0x2953399124F0cBB46d2CbACD8A89cF0599974963\n\n\n## Manager Addresses\n\n- 0x3B67727B341B5a12043F8fa13Be67897b98E5a2F\n- 0x96F925Fd09925A5b14Ab8AeE1f0a721182e85EF5\n\n\n## Is this collection generated programmatically?\n- **No**\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=84a8a6b0-b5eb-11ec-bdef-bfbc9f87a33b)**",

    "body": "> by 0xd61d194fe72e23a157b714ae16bfe98d8815112e\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nBlockchain Homes aims to develop a decentralized application that leverages blockchain, crypto, and NFTs to facilitate real estate connections. The first step to facilitating a RE transaction on the blockchain requires us to digitize a real world property using drone footage, architectural schemes, and 3D modeling allowing us to create an immersive NFT of the physical asset. Having an NFT rendering of the property allows us to potentially move into different metaverse assets. Allowing people to create a duplicate digital property will improve and increase the number of users in decentraland and help develop the ecosystem much quicker. Outside the metaverse our goal is to improve the speed, transparency, and security of RE transactions.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xd61d194fE72E23A157b714Ae16Bfe98D8815112E\n\n## Description\n\nOutside the metaverse our decentralized app will allow allow people to invest in and buy properties globally, improve and move land registries plus titles to the blockchain, increase transparency of transactions and market activity, create a 3 layer security protocol, and allow people to maximize profits when selling because it is a much smaller fee to list and promote property. When tokenizing properties, firms with large amounts of assets can easily inspect, control, or liquidate assets much easier. Tokenizing a property also means the ability for people to leverage assets to receive loans and build generational wealth. Whole countries will benefit because they can increase FDI and receive taxes directly from owner wallets. Citizens in countries with bad players in leadership will be protected from corruption and land right grabs because everything can be verified on the blockchain. One of the key components of the project will be the creation of the community governance which ensures it remains decentralized and never in control of the big banks. All that seems ideal but how does this impact or improve decentraland? Well home owners can quickly establish themselves and their property on decentraland using our NFT. The dao and community can use fees to increase DAO funds and the practicality of the ecosytem overall. Larger properties will boost the sale of other digital assets like art and furniture to decorate the digital property. BlockChain Homes in collaboration with decentraland can create a seamless connection between the physical and web 3.0.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe digitizing process will create thousands of jobs for independent contractors to go to the physical property and use our equipment to digitize the property. Our platform will list and verify ownership of the property and connect with different worlds like decentraland. Our dapp built ontop of the ethereum will include side chains and protocols like Graph to make it easy for people to extract data from the blockchain and assess property info plus value. When homeowners decide to list the property for sell our platform will make it accessible to a larger pool of buyers and offer a smart contract. Once the smart contract is executed the transaction will be listed on the blockchain, our public ledger and a local gov. registry. Our protocol expert Diogenes Caseras is creating a system that allows us to incorporate side chains while minimizing vulnerability.

    "title": "Should Events announcements be limited to 1 day or less at a time to be considered \"Happening now\"??",
    "body": "> by 0x66b1488a32e21f2d2757713d16facd9d25ec977c (Roots)\n\nI love to go to the Events page to see what is happening now or soon, so that I can be there when the cool stuff happens. As it stands, there is a rotating banner of trending events (I like this) A static list of trending events (a bit redundant, but if kept to 6 or less doesn't bother me), then a bunch of events that started days or weeks ago, followed by events actually in progress or happening soon.\n\nMy problem lies with the events that are scheduled to last multiple days but really are only active for a few hours on the first day. Many times when I go to these events, the actual event is long over and no one is there. I think the event organizer should have to post a new event announcement for things that are multiple days or even if they run more than 3 hours. At the very least, I would be happy if there was a maximum time for an event of 24 hours. After that the announcement goes away. With something like a festival or long format event where there is activity for more than a few hours or even days, a new event announcement should be made for each segment of the event.\n\nThere is currently an event at the top of the list hat has been going on for 11 days. If you jump in to that parcel, there is nothing going on. Most events last 3 hours or less but the announcement may remain for weeks afterward.\n\nExample image: https://imgur.com/a/9raRaFd\n\nShould we continue to let event organizers hog the top slots of the Events page or should there be additional limits set to how long an event can be happening \"now\"?\n\n(side note: Also, the Events.decentraland.org page behaves differently from the in game version. It would be nice if the in game version was more like the .org version).\n\n- No, it is fine the way it is.\n- Yes, add limits to length of events.\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4f79c580-aeef-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231)**",

    "title": "A Strategy to improve the relationship between MakerDAO and MANA.",
    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel#1f49)\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis document details a tested strategy that will help the DAO secure the position of MANA in the MakerDAO ecosystem. It will do so by increasing the collateralized MANA in Maker protocol and increasing the liquidity volumes in decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\n**Background**\n\n[MakerDAO](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/) , one of the oldest DAOs, provides a significant service to the crypto and decentralized finance space: it’s the DAO behind the stablecoin known as DAI. DAI’s value is backed by different crypto assets such as ETH, USDC, USDT, etc. The MakerDAO community defines DAI as a “decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar.” DAI’s collateral backing, then, is part of the stablecoin’s essence.\n\nIn July 2020,  [MakerDAO included MANA](https://blog.makerdao.com/mana-approved-by-maker-governance-as-collateral-type-in-the-maker-protocol/)  as acceptable collateral for minting new DAI in the platform. This authorization represented excellent news for MANA, since it meant an upgrade in its status as a reserve of value. Users could now take out a DAI loan using their MANA as collateral without the need to sell it first.\n\nYet, in late 2021, MANA almost got downgraded again in a sudden turn of events. The attempt began with a signal request, a formal proposition for action or change in a specific platform. Signal requests are usually coupled with polls through which the community votes whether accept or decline the proposals. In September 2021,  [a signal request](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-offboard-mana-bat-zrx-lrc-univ2-linketh-and-univ2-aaveeth/10467)  from the MakerDAO forum presented a plan to remove MANA and some other tokens as acceptable collateral. By the time the polls closed in early October, the initiative had gathered enough votes to offboard and delist many tokens. But MANA, for its part, was spared from the offboarding. Thanks to community signaling, which advised against a downgrade, MANA persisted in the list of acceptable collateral for minting new DAI.\n\nAs observed per the cited signal request, the MakerDAO is interested in delisting unprofitable collateral types. The MakerDAO has sufficient incentive to remove the less efficient collateral types. First off, every collateral type has some fixed costs on oracle price feeds. On the other hand, each collateral type brings extra complexity to the team maintaining the project.\n\nIn this vein, MakerDAO is interested in seeing more DAI minted with MANA as collateral; otherwise, MANA might be delisted and no longer stand as acceptable collateral. Also, MakerDAO would like to see more liquidity in exchanges between MANA and DAI. They expect such increased liquidity because, if the price of MANA were to drop abruptly, a more liquid scenario would help reduce the risk of liquidating an undercollateralized position of MANA.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe current fee to mint DAI using MANA as collateral is 6% annually.\n\nAfter conversations with MakerDAO, they might consider reducing this fee to 3% if we (1) reach 10M of DAI collateralized in MANA while (2) increasing the liquidity in DEXs.\n\nThere are methodic steps in reaching both goals. Thus, this proposal describes the use of the DAOs Treasury holdings to increase the MANA collateral and liquidity in exchanges — therefore matching the two standards that MakerDAO expects.\n\nAs a side note, it’s important to mention that if this initiative succeeds, it will result in a very positive outcome for the MANA holding community. In what would be a significant step ahead, a MANA holder looking to request a loan using her MANA as collateral will find her annual rates cut by half.\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe straightforward way to tackle the dual challenge would be contributing towards liquidity. So, for the sake of examples, let’s say the DAO wants to contribute 5M in collateralized MANA for this cause.\n\nTo contribute such a sum, The DAO would need to take some MANA from its treasury and lock it in a Maker Volt. In exchange for it, the DAO would receive 5M of DAI. This is, quite plainly, a loan collateralized with MANA.\n\nSuch a loan should be over-collateralized to ensure we don’t lose the collateral in the sudden event of a MANA price drop. Therefore, the suggestion is to do a 3x collateralized ratio. At the current MANA price, that would signify ~6,200,000 MANA, which would, in turn, represent 5M of DAI.\n\nAt the moment, we should pay an annual interest rate of 6%. Thus, keeping up with the former logic, it would represent 180,000 DAI. But that’s the worst-case scenario. Since the whole initiative intends to succeed, MakerDAO will eventually reduce this fee to 3%, thus downsizing the sum to half.\n\nAfterward, we should position 5M of DAI + 5M worth of MANA in the MANA<>DAI Liquidity Pool at Sushiswap. Why Sushiswap? It’s simple: it has the deepest liquidity for the pair in any DEX. According to this  [MANA/DAI liquidity poll](https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0x495f8ef80e13e9e1e77d60d2f384bb49694823ef)  (LP), we can expect a return of investment of 2,000 DAI per day. It would not only cover the costs of the loan — but it would also leave a significant margin in net DAO profits.\n\nThe previous example, then, would prove successful in achieving the double goal of accruing 10M of DAI collateralized in MANA, all while increasing the liquidity in DEXs.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWith a set of strategic steps, Decentraland’s DAO can significantly contribute to securing MANA’s position in the DAI ecosystem, maintaining MANA as acceptable collateral, reducing the loan fees for MANA holders, and improving the liquidity of DEXs.\n\nThere is a tested strategy to address this issue, and the DAO suggests we take on it.\n\nVote\n\n*   For: Improve MANA situation at MakerDAO\n*   Against: Do nothing\n\n- For: Improve MANA situation at MakerDAO\n- Against: Do nothing\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0b3a1f60-aea8-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231)**",

    "title": "Establish a Formal Process for Adding/Removing DAO Committee Members",
    "body": "> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Establish a Formal Process for Adding/Removing DAO Committee Members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=782bbe80-9adf-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe DAO needs a clear process for removing and adding DAO Committee members. This proposal is a Draft Proposal outlining such a process for community consideration.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe DAO needs to be able to add and remove committee members in a variety of situations:\n\n*   When a committee member resigns\n*   When the community wants to replace a committee member\n*   When a committee member must be removed quickly in an emergency\n\nThere are also several needs that need to be balanced when making changes to the DAO Committee:\n\n*   Decisions must be as decentralized as possible\n    \\-Only qualified and trustworthy candidates should be appointed to the committee\n*   Committee members must be able to collaborate and work well together\n    \\-The committee must be able to act immediately in an emergency\n\nBearing in mind the situations and needs listed above, please review this draft proposal process for removing, sourcing, and appointing DAO Committee members.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Currently**, the process for adding or removing a DAO Committee Member can only be triggered and/or canceled (within a 24 hour delay mechanism) by a Security Advisor Board (SAB) member. This proposal introduces a pathway to expand the stakeholders and processes involved in removing and appointing DAO Committee Members to include the SAB, DAO Committee Members or members of the Decentraland Community.\n\nAdding a new committee member is only initiated following the removal or resignation of an existing member which should be triggerable by any of the above stakeholders, including the committee member wishing to resign.\n\nThe following section introduces the **proposed** processes and procedures that each stakeholder category can initiate in order to remove and subsequently add a member to the DAO Committee.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Removing a committee member**\n\nEach stakeholder category will have a different process for initiating the removal of a DAO Committee Member.\n\n***How a committee member removal can be initiated:***\n\n1.  **By the DAO Committee:**\n\n*   Any committee member can create the delayed transaction in Aragon (including the resigning member)\n*   After 24 hours, the committee member is removed\n*   Any committee members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window.\n*   DAO Committee must create a proposal to confirm the decision with the community\n\n2.  **By the Security Advisory Board:**\n\n*   The SAB can create a delayed committee member removal transaction in Aragon\n    After 24 hours, the member is removed\n*   3 of 5 SAB members can cancel the removal within the 24 hour delay window\n*   In an emergency situation, the SAB can create a removal transaction in Aragon that is immediately implemented, temporarily removing committee powers from a DAO committee member\n*   Transaction must be confirmed by 3 of the 5 SAB members within 24 hours or the Committee Member’s powers are restored. If confirmed, the committee member is removed and their token burned. If unconfirmed they must be reinstated.\n*   If removing a member in an emergency, the SAB must create a proposal to retroactively confirm the decision with the community\n\n3.  **By the community by creating a proposal:**\n\n*   The DAO should add a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal category with the following required parameters:\n    *   The name of the committee member to remove\n    *   Reasoning for the removal of the committee member. This should include evidence supporting their removal in the event of misconduct.\n*   To submit a proposal to remove a committee member a community member must have 5,000 VP or delegated VP.\n*   The acceptance criteria for committee member removal proposals should be set to 6 million VP and 2/3rds participating majority of voting power.\n*   If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes, the committee member is expected to resign.\n*   If a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal passes and the committee member does not wish to resign, the DAO Committee should initiate a delayed removal transaction.\n    In the event that the remaining DAO Committee members do not ratify the removal decision, they must submit a proposal to the community arguing the case for retaining the committee member.\n\n1.  If this proposal is rejected, then the SAB is responsible for removing the committee member.\n2.  If this proposal passes with an acceptance criteria of at least 6 million VP and a 2/3rds participating majority of voting power, then the committee member is not removed.\n\n**After the removal has been approved by the DAO, several steps have to be taken:**\n\n*   In the event of an immediate resignation or emergency removal of a committee member, a member of the SAB should stand in as a temporary member until a replacement is appointed\n*   The Committee member’s COMMITTEE token in Aragon must be burned to prevent them from initiating transactions on the DAO’s behalf.\n*   The Committee member’s address must be removed from the DAO’s multisig proxy.\n*   The process for finding a replacement member should be initiated by the DAO Committee as a post on the Forum calling for applications\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Adding a committee member**\n\nThe process for adding a committee member includes three stages: the open application period, the committee interviews, and a final vote by ranked choice. If the DAO decides not to implement support for ranked choice voting, then separate proposals could be created for each individual candidate selected by the DAO Committee after the interview stage.\n\n***Open application period (2 weeks)***\n\nApplications submitted as posts on the forum, applicants should answer:\n\n1.  What is your full name?\n2.  What is your primary wallet address?\n3.  Why are you applying?\n4.  What is your history with both Decentraland and Decentraland’s DAO?\n5.  What skills, qualifications, and experience will you bring to the committee?\n6.  Can you commit at least 10 hours per week to the DAO?\n7.  Provide links to any relevant social media profiles or other information that will help the community when evaluating candidates.\n8.  Provide a list of two references, at least one of which is in the Decentraland community that can attest to your character and/or commitment to Decentraland.\n\n***Committee Interviews (1 week)***\n\nGiven how closely the DAO Committee must work together in order to accomplish its goals, it is important that they all work well together as a team. Furthermore, the existing DAO Committee members (having already earned the DAO’s trust) should act as additional filters in the selection process.\n\nThe existing DAO Committee should have 1 week to interview candidates as a panel.\n\n***Final community vote (2 weeks)***\n\nAfter the interview phase, the DAO Committee is responsible for creating a final proposal in the DAO listing their picks for the top 5 candidates. The DAO should implement a ranked choice voting system for committee member additions.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5fd09520-ae73-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231)**",

    "body": "> by 0xe7e477ef1676a46ae6621983834a6e0b29c06979\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe are a small group of technical artists and coders who have recently fallen in love with the decentraland metaverse. Our plan in short is to purchase 2 ESTATEs and on them we will build a series of apartment buildings and townhomes. Apartments consisting of 1 and 2 bedroom floor plans, while townhomes consist of 2-4 bedroom floor plans. Rent in apartments will not exceed $450.00USD in MANA per month with 1 bed units starting at $225.00USD in MANA per month. Townhome rent will not exceed $950.00USD in MANA per month. We believe this project will provide the community with easily attainable housing that comes furnished as a place or places that can be used as a home or a hub for any metaverse business users may wish to begin creating.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n50,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe7e477ef1676a46ae6621983834A6e0b29C06979\n\n## Description\n\nHello all! And thank you for taking the time to look over our project. We believe if we receive funding for our project we'd be solving a few issues that new and existing users share. To begin, building affordable housing within decentraland would make it so the community members who don't have a large budget will have a place of their own. In these spaces users will be able to mingle with friends, host private parties, watch live streaming content on provided televisions as all apartments and townhomes will come fully furnished with the option of adding new items in the future. Everyone would love to have a piece of the metaverse to call their very own, but we all don't have an extra 14-15k for one parcel of land. I feel as though this would provide new and existing users an entirely new experience bringing a whole new element to the decentraland metaverse. Construction of this property will also create several new job positions within decntraland paying no less than $1300.00USD monthly guaranteed. These will include positions such as property managers & leasing agents. Any issues found in the apartments will be reported to the property manager who will report back to us and any issue should be hashed out within 24 hours. Everyone deserves their own corner of the metaverse and that's what we are trying to achieve for everyone. Thank you for taking the time to consider my proposal.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOnce funding is received we would immediately go purchase the ESTATES required for building to begin. Once the land is in our possession construction will begin immediately using a mix of the decentraland builder and the SDK to ensure each user experience will be truly unique. Every member of our team has a graphical design background or a hardcore coding background so estimated build time will be 4-6 weeks after funding.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nJohn Moses - Programmer\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/tuckermoses\nRichard Brown - Lead designer\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/rbrown7887\nBen Thomas - Co design lead\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-thomas-b78b726\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOnce funded building will be complete wihtin 4-6 weeks all info will be shared via reddit in the r/decentralandgame subreddit where we will be releasing the link to our new discord channel as well.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2d2a9f40-adfa-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231)**",

    "body": "> by 0xa87d168717538e86d71ac48baccaeb84162de602 (cryptonico#e602)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Representing third-party NFTs as wearables in Decentraland](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to close a few definitions and rules for Linked Wearables.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nAfter long debates in the DAO and different proposals, there is a need to gather all insights, tell a single story and make definitions for this awesome feature to be successful.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis is the forth proposal on the Linked Wearables topic.\n\nThis is the story about the previous 3 proposals:\n\n1.  The [original proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) (this one), where this feature was introduced and first described. It was called Third Party Wearables at that moment. Here is a short phrase that captures its intent:\n\n    *In short, people want the ability to don their NFTs as wearables when strolling through Decentraland.*\n\n    The process to make Linked Wearables was simple, but there were some things that where not detailed. That’s where the second proposal comes in.\n\n2.  [Submission fees](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=90a67ae0-7320-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) for Linked Wearables: As you may have read from the original proposal, third parties needed to buy Slots for each 3D representation of their NFTs. But at which price? The result of that proposal was to make it pair with the current submission fee for regular wearables. This makes sense, but if you dig deeper, some differences come evident. For example, Linked Wearables can not be sold in the marketplace, they don’t have rarities and are not exactly wearables. So it may be worth to be thought again and find a better balance.\n\n3.  [Programmatic collections](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=83351b70-a0a0-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a) came third to cover a particular use case that was brought up by interested third parties. The fact is that many communities interested in this have really large collections that were made programmatically. This means a software combined a set of pre-designed traits to get the final models as a result. With the fee defined in the prior proposal, it got totally restrictive for these communities as it would cost millions to have Linked Wearables, getting all of us far from the spirit of the feature, which should be inclusive by definition.\n\nA lot has been learned from past proposals. Now, I’d like to propose an improvement that would help this feature to meet its true goal: **Onboard existing communities to Decentraland**, and make them feel welcome by customizing their avatar with their already existing NFTs and giving collectors the chance to express their PFP persona inside Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Linked Wearables are 3D representations of NFTs outside Decentraland** that can be used as wearables in-world, can be equipped on the avatar, and are found in the backpack.\n\nLinked Wearables are not [regular wearables](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/wearables-overview/). They look the same, but they carry a completely different meaning.\n\nLinked Wearables do not exist inside traditional wearable collections, have no rarity, and **can not** be sold in [primary](https://market.decentraland.org/browse?assetType=item\\&section=wearables) or [secondary](https://market.decentraland.org/browse?assetType=nft\\&section=wearables\\&vendor=decentraland\\&page=1\\&sortBy=recently_listed\\&onlyOnSale=true\\&viewAsGuest=false\\&onlySmart=false) markets. They are only **in-world representations mapped to external NFTs by the Third Party.**\n\n**These are the steps that Third Parties need to follow to have Linked Wearables:**\n\n1.  **Create a DAO proposal** in the category **“Linked Wearables Registry”** to be accepted as an approved Third Party, then the tool will be available.\n2.  Wait one week for DAO's approval. Ask your community for help, they can vote for you to be accepted.\n3.  **Submit wearables** in the **Builder** using the available **Slots**. Once the item is submitted to the builder you will see a property called **URN**. That **URN** is the one that you will need to use in the [API response](https://github.com/decentraland/adr/blob/main/docs/ADR-42-third-party-assets-integration.md#third-party-resolver).\n4.  Wait for Curators Committee approval.\n5.  Develop the API.\n6.  Spread the word! tell your community that they can **enjoy their brand new Linked Wearables inside Decentraland**.\n\n**So what is missing though?**\n\nThere are 3 very important things that were not addressed in the previous lines or need to be reviewed:\n\n1.  What would be the **VP (voting power)** threshold needed for Third Parties to be approved (not discussed yet)\n2.  What would be the final **price of each slot**\n3.  How many items will **curators review** in programmatic and hand-made collections\n\nEven though the price of slots were set at a fixed rate of 500 USD and the approach to curate programmatic collections was declined (details mentioned above), I propose the following combination to support third parties and, at the same time, being cautious of which third party is actually approved:\n\n1.  **4M VP threshold**\n\nThis would be a blocker for scammers and people with bad intentions that don’t have a strong community and only want to abuse this feature by flooding the catalyst network with 3D Models. At the same time, only legit communities would pass this filter.\n\n2.  **Free slots**\n\nThe DAO will be the only beneficiary from a fee here, but as the goal is to encourage communities to come into Decentraland, the DAO could afford this and give Slots to Third Parties when they need them.\n\n3.  **\"Reasonable\" curation**\n\nHand-made collections have to be curated in full as there is no guarantee on how each 3D model was made, but for programmatic collections, the perfect balance would be to:\n\n1.  Audit the process\n\n2.  Curate 1% of the collection\n\n3.  Minimum of 50 items to be curated (if the programmatic collection has less than 50 items, it has to be curated in full)\n\n4.  Maximum of 300 items to be curated\n\nCuration fees are covered by the DAO and will be the same amount as regular wearables, so for a curator, it shouldn’t matter what type of collection it is.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis should be a very inclusive feature that allows many communities to know Decentraland and everything it has to offer. We, as a community, also need to welcome them and make it easy to access but at the same time, secure. Please vote 😄.\n\n**Voting Options**\n\n**In favor:** 4M VP to accept third parties + free slots + Reasonable curation\n\n**Against:** 1M VP to accept third parties + 500 USD slots + Curating every item in every collection\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f69c4d40-aaaf-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231)**",

    "title": "Scaling Filmrare to acquire titles, create wearables, and onboard filmmakers",
    "body": "> by 0xb5e34509cf4004ecb51392398d7c18b1d8a0db3f (Ravi#db3f)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nFilmrare has established a stream of content that has brought people together to watch movies in a metaverse movie theater that behaves a lot like real-world cinemas. Our core philosophy/principle has been to always acquire rights to screen content. This might be slow but it ensures that the creator/rights owners are onboarded to DCL, are compensated for their work, and spread awareness. We have spent hours building relationships with independent filmmakers and rights owners. We don't want to stop here and make this effort a scalable/profitable venture so that it's recognized as a genuine venue to consume content. This grant will keep us alive until we turn profitable.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xb5E34509cf4004ecB51392398D7C18B1D8a0DB3f\n\n## Description\n\nThe first thing we did to expand was to partner with projects that align with our philosophy. Hence, we moved into SciArtLab where we have scaled into a cineplex with 6 floors including 3 floors with movie screens. SciArtLab has been a major support in marketing our vision to fellow DCL players. Check out the district http://district.sciartlab.com/\n\nWe are also building partnerships with rights owners from the entertainment industry. Some of the people that we have acquired from are\n\n1.  Wave Films - http://wave-films.com/\n\n2.  IndieRights -https://www.indierights.com/\n\n3.  NewGen Entertainment - https://www.newgenentertainment.it/\n\n4.  Josh Stifter - https://twitter.com/joshstifter\n\n5.  Bitjoin Studios -https://twitter.com/bitjoin\n\nNew partners in the pipeline\n\n1.  GlobalFlix - https://www.globalflix.tv/globalflix-studios\n\n2.  TVCO - https://www.tvco.eu/\n\n3.  Minerva Pictures - https://www.minervapicturesinternational.com/\n\n4.  Underground Film Festival - https://twitter.com/Underground_FF\n\nAs mentioned before we acquire rights to screen the film. This effort is making two important changes\n\n1.  We're establishing a sanitized process to become the default movie theater in DCL\n\n2.  We're establishing a new rights category never used before called \"Meta Rights\" where we pick the rights to screen content for a limited number of runs during a period by paying an acquisition fee. This will become a standard going forward in the industry.\n\nThe process to pick titles: Since, we handpick content we have a lengthy conversation with the rights owner where we explain metaverse, Decentraland, and what a movie theater looks like in DCL. We invite them for a private screening to experience it. We educate them about the future of metaverse, VR, and crypto. We also push to use the \"Meta Rights\" that don't conflict with existing rights. We too learn about the industry's biases and prejudices making us to better navigate the conversation.\n\nThe process to screen: We have a manual process to screen the movie at a particular time and we focus our effort during the UTC evenings when the activity is the highest. Our shows usually start at 6 PM UTC. We manually screen the films that are delivered to the screen, we also are working on a DRM tech to prevent screen capture during the show to prevent bootlegging.\n\nThe process to market: We are hyperfocused on DCL as our prime platform. We spend time in DCL discord promoting the events that we create on the event page. We also have a growing community in SciArtLab where we have a Filmrare channel and do Twitter Spaces at least once a month. We are building https://filmrare.com and starting work on SEO.\n\nThe process to monetize: We aim to be self-sustainable in 6 months. Our monetization is split into these 3 categories\n\n1.  Wearable Access: We have Theater 1 specifically allowing access through buying a wearable that gives you lifetime access. Our first wearable is already live\n    https://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0x2371015f90f14b64f79e280577a7152a4797ff14/items/0\n\n2.  Blue-chip NFT project access - We are planning to market to blue-chip NFT projects and sell early access wearables to members to leverage the community.\n\n3.  Space rental - We're talking to potential entertainment/creative companies/Projects that are looking to have a metaverse presence and allow them to rent space in Filmrare. We have growing foot traffic of about 1000-1500 players per week already.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOur Filmrare scene is already live at 2,55. Our monthly tasks and the cost associated are below\n\n1.  Founder Salary - $1500\n2.  Metaverse movie projectionist salary - $750\n3.  Rental - $1200\n4.  Cost of rights acquisition - $3000 - $5000\n5.  Cost of wearable creation - $500 - $1000\n6.  Cost of Video Streaming/Storage - $500\n7.  Cost of creatives/marketing - $500\n\nTotal = $10,450\n\nWe have events almost every day. Our next immediate event is https://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=cf56da25-2b88-4ff4-a97c-e8b83f67a100\n\nOur sample \"Meta Rights Agreement\" is shared here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BS1cawbopuaXYgZ4q3CFcXldQlDvym2u/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nFilmrare was started as a single-screen cinema by Ravi Krishnan in January. We have already been given a successful grant for the month of March & April. https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=20fa0450-9067-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a\n\nMy profile can also be checked here\n\nhttps://twitter.com/krcnow\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/krcnow/\n\nOur Filmrare Twitter -> https://twitter.com/filmrareNFT\n\nOur SciArtLab discord community is vibrant and growing. We get a lot of support from the members. https://discord.gg/gpcDa4tag2\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur roadmap is to screen at least 5 movies in a month starting May. Our April content is already filled with 4 movies that we have acquired. This fund will ensure our content supply until September.\n\nOur second milestone is to sell 1000 access wearable by July. https://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0x2371015f90f14b64f79e280577a7152a4797ff14/items/0\n\nOur third milestone is to onboard/rent space to at least four companies/projects in our scene by June.\n\nOur fourth milestone is to bring a film festival to DCL by July either by a partnership or as our own endeavor.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e83b6560-a866-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231)**",

That meaning I sound like the \"In a world...\" guy from movie trailers.\n\nMy Proposal is that in the future, when ever this project needs more voice talent on the team, that I (Brandonmanus.ETH) will be among the first few to be considered for a role as a Male Voice Actor for Decentraland.\n\nImagine Hearing a James Earl Jones type voice for In game Achievements, Trailers, and basic interactions between avatars BUT that voice was a talent found from the community.\n\nHere is a Link to my YouTube to hear what I sound like -\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qUYI6yNykc\n\nThank you for your time and hope you're having a dope day!\n\n*   Brandonmanus.ETH\n\n- YES!

    "body": "> by 0x06a424b0826fb195b9ed24aea37eaac65655624f (Julian#624f)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAfter everyone's feedback we decided to narrow the scope. This will allow us to demonstrate that we deliver and that our product adds value to DCL users.\n\nOur mission is to improve the event’s ecosystem in DCL. Our solution consists of three sections: DApp, SDK and Builder:\n\n*   An event management & NFT ticketing DApp, which we call Fanszoid\n*   Custom code for the DCL SDK that integrates with our platform\n*   Simple and user-friendly smart items for the DCL Builder\n\nWe've been developing for the last 8 months. Last week we launched our first version of the product. We hope to see you in our launch event (Sat 8PM UTC)\n\nWith this grant we will be able to support our actual team for 6 months and also help us get to a point of sustainability.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xc7FA9db5CfF0a1132828aeabe57769F56cae524F\n\n## Description\n\nOur objective is to address one of the biggest opportunities regarding metaverse events: **monetization**. Nowadays only a small percentage of tech savvy organizers have figured out how to mint their own NFT collection and sell them as tickets for an event.\n\nManaging tickets as NFTs provides many advantages:\n\n*   Fraud free ticket resale & ticket trading\n*   Tickets sync with blockchain address\n*   Royalties to organizers on each resale\n*   The possibility of trading an event ticket post event because of the attached value\n*   Tickets will be seen as collectibles\n*   Native Integrations with Decentraland\n\nOffering a ticketing solution will appeal to promoters and artist managers where they can easily derive revenue from sales where currently this is the unknown within virtual world experiences \\[being mostly free].\n\nBear in mind that we have a lot of people that want to do things on the metaverse, but they just don't know how. Now, there’s a tool to help them do it. Therefore bringing new people to the ecosystem.\n\nOur primary objective is to bring a lot of value to Decentraland and the Decentraland community, such as:\n\n*   Make available a NFT ticket marketplace\n*   Generate a new revenue stream for all event organizers\n*   Bring more use cases to LAND parcels and therefore increase their value\n*   Facilitate collaboration between brands and metaverse creators for sponsoring events\n*   Increase amount of events hosted\n\n\n## Specification\n\nIn order for this to be possible we’ve built a team to develop a decentralized application where users will be able to create and promote events, browse, buy and resell tickets, and manage sales and statistics in a dashboard.\n\nOur backend stack consists of:\n\n*   Smart contracts:  Events (ERC721) , Tickets (ERC1155) and Marketplace.\n*   Subgraph to index the blockchain data.\n*   A NodeJS API that aggregates data from the subgraph and allows event organizers to monitor event sales, check ownership of tickets, etc.\n\nUsing our platform, event organizers will be able to:\n\n*   Divide their LAND into sections: General, VIP, Ultra VIP, and so on.\n*   Use a Builder Smart Item to easily limit access to a LAND ( or LAND section ) to ticket owners.\n*   Dress users in each section with different wearables which will only be available during the event\n*   Attach a wearable to a ticket that the user will be able to use in all Decentraland, creating value for the ticket after the event.\n*   Add POAP’s to every event in one click with our seamless integration\n\nThe grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stablecoins assigned to a 2-out-of-2 signatures Multisig. Participants are Julian Neuss and Juan Oliva.\n\n### Conditions of the Grant\n\nThe Grant is conditioned to the satisfaction and fulfillment of each and all of the following:\n\n*   Fanszoid’s team shall use the funds from the Grant solely for the purpose of developing and maintaining the Fanszoid platform, as described in below, in accordance with the roadmap detailed below (“Roadmap and Milestones”).\n*   Fanszoid’s team shall set up a Multisig Wallet, for purposes of receiving the Grant, with the signatories indicated above. Disbursements of the Grant shall be conditioned upon achieving the roadmap milestones and presented in the monthly reports within the timeframe set forth below.\n*   Fanszoid’s team will provide the DAO with the following information:\n    *   Within five (5) days of the beginning of each month, a Monthly Progress Report regarding the development of the Fanszoid platform and the achievement of Milestones will be presented to the DAO.\n    *   Within ten (10) days of the beginning of each month, Monthly Financial Report showing use of the proceeds of the Grant.\n*   Upon failure to comply with any of the conditions of above by Fanszoid’s team, the vesting contract will be revoked by the DAO, returning unvested funds.\n\nFeel free to check out everything:\n\n[Github](https://github.com/Fanszoid)\n\n[Beta on Polygon mainnet](https://app.fanszoid.com/)\n\n[Beta on Polygon Mumbai testnet](https://dev.fanszoid.com/)\n\nSocials:\n\n[Website](https://www.fanszoid.com/)\n\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fanszoid/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/fanszoid)\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/fanszoid)\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/GBv89mWgbQ)\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe team to develop the application is the following:\n\n*   Julian Neuss - CEO & Software Engineer\n*   Juan Oliva - CTO & Blockchain Developer\n*   Martin Grabina - Blockchain Developer\n*   Caleb Faillace Villanueva - SR Frontend Developer\n*   Nicole Hinojo Toré - JR Frontend Developer\n*   Franco Leone - Crypto Virtual Assistant & Community Manager\n\nTotal Hours: ~960 monthly hours or ~240 weekly hours.\n\nBudget: 10,000 USD per month, including payroll and operational expenses.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe roadmap will be divided into 3 stages:\n\n**Stage 1**. First we will help DCL organizers to create events using our platform while also developing more features and building partnerships with event organizers and districts.\n\n**Stage 2**. Once the user base starts to flourish events will be frequently created. Now our focus will shift from doing manual things to getting sure the platform can scale. For this we will create a strong documentation and tutorial videos. Meanwhile we will still develop new features.\n\n**Stage 3**. By this stage we expect to have a decent amount of monthly events hosted throughout our platform, be it from individual organizers to several districts. The team will keep delivering features and set metrics to track growth. All the statistics gathered will be shared with Decentraland.\n\nPossible upcoming tasks:\n\n*   Develop Secondary Marketplace for safe ticket resale\n*   Add POAP integration\n*   Develop Smart Item for the Decentraland Builder\n*   Accept more wallets on the DApp\n*   Accept Fiat/VISA payments on the DApp\n*   Prepare code and SDK documentation & tutorials\n*   Build Ranking, Favorites, Support, Statistics and Status pages\n\nFanszoid will use agile development practices to ensure a fast implementation of all requirements and the continuous improvement of such features.\n\nAlso, the team will be available every month to host an open meeting with members of the DCL community to talk about upcoming steps.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=83634560-a3d7-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a)**",

    "title": "Curation of Programmatic Collections for Linked Wearables",
    "body": "> by 0x87956abc4078a0cc3b89b419928b857b8af826ed (Nacho)\n\n### Summary\n\nDefine the curation process of Programmatic Collections for Linked Wearables a.k.a [Third Party Wearables](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240).\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis is a [follow up proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=90a67ae0-7320-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) to cover one particular use case around Linked Wearables collections that are created in a programmatic way. This means that each item was not crafted individually by hand, but automatically generated with code, many times from traits that were previously designed and modeled. [CryptoPunks](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks), [CryptoAvatars](https://opensea.io/collection/averagepunks-) and [BAYC](https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub) are examples of Programmatic Collections.\n\n### Motivation\n\nIt is very unpractical, and almost impossible, to curate all the wearables in a large collection of 10k items, or more. It is also prohibitively expensive for third parties. But if that collection was made programmatically, it may not be necessary to curate every item one by one. It would make much more sense to audit the **process** used to generate that collection and curate a **random portion** of the items. Like when you are boiling spaghetti, you don’t need to try them all to know when it’s ready ;)\n\n### Specification\n\nThis is a proposal to introduce a new and more efficient way to curate this particular case of collections for Linked Wearables. It will make it easier and faster for the curator, shorten the time to put the collection in production, and save costs for the third parties.\n\nThe new mechanic consists of 2 parts:\n\n1.  **Reviewing the method:** the curator will review the programmatic method used to create the items in the collection. If the method proves to be generating items programatically with the same base traits, it will follow up with the second step.\n2.  **Reviewing items in the collection:** as the items were not created individually - but automatically with a previously validated programmatic method - there is no need to review each item in the collection. Reviewing just a random portion of the items will be enough to validate the rest. The curator will randomly choose X% items in the collection and curate only those. X% to be defined in this proposal.\n\n### Voting\n\nVote to define “X”, meaning the portion of the collection to be curated to consider it approved as a whole.\n\n1.  **YES: X = 1%**\n2.  **YES: X = 0.5%**\n3.  **YES: X = 0.25%**\n4.  **YES: X = 0.1%**\n5.  **NO:** Decline this curation method for programmatic collections in Linked Wearables\n\n### Examples\n\n*   **“x” = 1%:** If 1% of the items in the collection have to be curated and the collection has 10k items, then 100 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 100 wearables\\*\n*   **“x” = 0.5%:** If 0.5% of the items have to be curated and the collection has 10k items, then 50 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 50 wearables\\*\n*   **“x” = 0.25%:** If 0.25% of the items have to be curated and the collection has 3k items, then 8 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 8 wearables\\*\n*   **“x” = 0.1%:** If 0.1% of the items have to be curated and the collection has 10k items, then 10 items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 10 wearables\\*\n*   **NO:** If the collection has 10k items and this curation method is not implemented, then 10k items need to be curated. Thus the third party needs to pay for 10k wearables\\*\n\n\\*(USD 500 per wearable as defined in [the past proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=90a67ae0-7320-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)).\n\nNote: consider that, if a Third Party has to pay for *all* the items in a large collection, the price could be extremely restrictive for any Third Party. For example: at current curation prices, if the collection has 10k items, the price for the curation would be 5 million US dollars!\n\n- YES: 1%\n- YES: 0.5%\n- YES: 0.25%\n- YES: 0.1%\n- NO\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=83351b70-a0a0-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a)**",

Right now the Decentraland project is maintaining two lists of POIs:\n\n*   Foundation maintained list, the first implementation of POIs (Legacy POI List).\n*   DAO maintained list, updated by the DAO Committee after a governance proposal for adding or removing a POI is approved.\n\nThis **creates an unnecessary complexity** by having to maintain two lists and prevents the DAO community from removing POIs that are defined on the legacy list by using the POI Removal proposal type.\n\nOn a more philosophical level, having a POI list embedded on the World Explorer (aka. Reference Client) **goes against the principle of decentralization and community ownership** of the project since another client wouldn't be able to use that list.\n\n### A simple but expensive solution\n\nWe could simply migrate all POIs from the Legacy POI List to the DAO maintained one. However the legacy list has 90 POIs, and adding all those by an on-chain transaction will have an estimated gas fee of 200 USD each, **totaling a ~$18.000 USD expense to keep those POIs**\n\nLegacy POI List: https://config.decentraland.org/explorer.json (See the [spreadsheet version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sdjojNKYUOLt-5v2KHnE4-9IFR5zjsUhqckRNVdNX2o/edit#gid=1503583878) with POI names)\n\nThis pre-proposal Poll aims to gather community feedback on the next steps. If any of the YES options get selected, this will become a DRAFT proposal for the community to vote on.\n\n- Yes, delete the legacy list and let the community vote for the POIs that should be re-added to the DAO maintained list\n- Yes, delete the legacy list and make the DAO pay for adding the 90 legacy POIs\n- No, maintain both lists\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b3cb6dc0-9f01-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a)**",

Our platform provide support for sellers, landlords, buyers & tenants, looking to start their adventure in Decentraland. DCL Real Estate enables a great LAND experience for O.G. DCL users, but also new outside buyers, tenants, investors & big companies to expand the Decentraland community & land sale. We provide sales-support, rental support aswell as buying & tenant advise, when looking to get into Decentraland, as a newcomer.\n\nDCL Real Estate would want a grant for a smart-contract system, that will provide more financial security to new DCL Investors, maximizing the utility and enlightening outside investors to invest in DCL LAND, for both sale & rent.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n29,119 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x29519122d08771Ca4c83C8E3Fa981Df18721f76D\n\n## Description\n\nDCL Real Estate - https://dclrealestate.org/\n\nDCL Real Estate, is a project to contribute to Decentraland. Our job is to get outside investors, to invest in Decentraland. We would need a grant, to expand the security within our large sums of transaction when doing land-deals & rentals, to secure payments when doing transactions between three parts. (example).\n\nWe're having daily 5-10 new users to Decentraland looking to learn more, buy, rent etc. So we are educating outside investors aswell as helping sellers & landlords to get their land to profit. Therefor with a smart-contract system helping us securing funds for the landlord, the seller and ourself (commission) would be a next-level in our field.\n\nWe have been talking with developers, saying it is possible to create such a smart-contract system. Example, if a tenant wants to rent this case: https://dclrealestate.org/lands-for-sale/case-id.516\n\nHe would then just press \"rent\", and the funds will automaticly be payed to the landlord directly, every month and also our cut. This means no manual transactions, and will provide A LOT of security to our clients.\n\nFor our future roadmap, we would allow EXTERNAL brokers, to use our site and smart-contract system, to benefit Decentraland the most, with as many brokers as possible promoting DCL to outside investors, looking to learn more. We have a lot of companies, that contact us - they have no clue where to start, and that's where we're helping them from A-Z, and our main requests are why we haven't a secure smart-contract in place.\n\nOur results so far, have been 5 sold lands, and 5 lands rented out.\n\nTo show our results so far, with how much we contribute to DCL our transperent income can be viewed here: https://imgur.com/a/Fm4kMCm\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe will complete the project, together with external developers that will help us establish, an external marketplace for rent, for sale that will allow a contract with 3 people within it. This will allow brokers, sellers, buyers, tenants & landlords to have a good & safe experience, while dealing with land - and to prevent scammers, being able to act as a random broker.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nPartner - Klockmann (Real Estate Agent)\nPartner - Laursen (Real Estate Agent)\nCreator Agent - MetaWear (Content Creator)\nDeveloper - We have gotten offers from experienced & known contract developers.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe timelime of this project:\n\n*   August 2022: Development finished, and launch of new security platform\n*   December 2022: Open Broker Site for DCL, to allow them using the platform\n*   2023: Allow all DCL users, to use the site as an external marketplace (with extra sales- and newbie help from hired Agents)\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=658069b0-9cde-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a)**",

And, also a custom SDK to facilitate the event creation in the Decentraland builder. Everything is detailed below.  We've been developing a lot for the last 8 months and this week finally launched our first version of the product. With this grant we will be able to support our actual team and bring more Web3 developers with our same vision of pushing Decentraland forward.\n\nAlso, we will have our first beta launch event next week, March 12 - 8PM UTC, if you are reading this you must attend =).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n233,800 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x06A424B0826fB195B9ED24Aea37eaaC65655624F\n\n## Description\n\nOur objective with Fanszoid is to address one of the biggest opportunities regarding metaverse events: monetization. Nowadays there is no organized structure for the monetization of an event hosted in the metaverse. In order to do so we will take advantage of blockchain technology to make NFT ticketing possible in Decentraland and build an SDK to facilitate its implementation. This will bring more use cases to LAND parcels and therefore increase their value.\n\nManaging tickets as NFTs provides many advantages:\n\n*   Fraud free ticket resale & ticket trading\n*   Tickets sync with blockchain address\n*   Royalties to organizers on each resale\n*   The possibility of trading an event ticket post event because of the attached value\n*   Tickets will be seen as collectibles\n*   Native Integrations with Decentraland\n\nOffering a ticketing solution will appeal to promoters and artist managers where they can easily derive revenue from sales where currently this is the unknown within virtual world experiences \\[being mostly free].\n\nBear in mind that we have a lot of people that want to do things on the metaverse, but they just don't know how. Now, there’s a tool to help them do it. Therefore bringing new people to the ecosystem.\n\nOur primary objective is to bring a lot of value to Decentraland and the Decentraland community, such as:\n\n*   Make available a NFT ticket marketplace\n*   Generate a new revenue stream for all event organizers\n*   Increase amount of events hosted\n*   Grow daily active users\n*   Expand awareness in the metaverse community\n*   Create more use cases for LAND owners\n*   Build interest in brands sponsoring future metaverse events\n*   Improve user experience for event attendees\n*   Increase wearable sales\n*   Surge wearable and build creations\n*   Provide our building on the metaverse as a people to meet & network\n*   Help make Decentraland mainstream\n\n\n## Specification\n\nIn order for this to be possible we are building a decentralized application where users will be able to create and promote events, browse, buy and resell tickets, and manage sales and statistics in a dashboard.\n\nWe also have created the Events SDK that allows event organizers to give access to the event to users who have purchased tickets.\n\nLink to the Github repo: https://github.com/Fanszoid\n\nUsing our Events SDK, event organizers will also be able to:\n\n*   Divide their LAND into sections: General, VIP, Ultra VIP, and so on.\n*   Dress users in each section with different wearables which will only be available during the event\n*   Attach a wearable to a ticket that the user will be able to use in all Decentraland, creating a post event ticket valuation.\n*   Add POAP’s to every event in one click with our seamless integration\n\nNow in-person event tickets could be attached to a Decentraland wearable.\n\nIn addition, we are communicating with the Festival District team, who worked with Decentraland on The Metaverse Festival, to see how Fanszoid could meet the future needs of promoters who need a ticketing solution.\n\nAs a final detail, we’ve launched our MVP, feel free to try it out.\nhttps://app.fanszoid.com/\n\nFor more info about our proposal you can check this presentation:\nhttps://bit.ly/Fanszoid\n\nYou can also find us at:\n\nReddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/Fanszoid/\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/fanszoid\n\nWebsite - https://www.fanszoid.com/\n\nTelegram - https://t.me/fanszoid\n\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/GBv89mWgbQ\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nJulian Neuss - Co-Founder & CEO - Software Engineer & crypto enthusiast.

    "body": "> by 0xa4244f6711052752e6bb0271bf17c756e6598406 (KevinOnEarth)\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nOur mission at The Decentraland Report is to preserve the history of our unfolding metaverse. As a Participate-To-Earn Experience unified under this common mission, we have grown into a team of Reporters who stream daily to ensure every day in Decentraland is captured for future generations to reflect on.\nWhat allows our community to contribute their valuable time to our Report is the incentives they earn for doing so.\nOver the course of the first year, every aspect of our Participate-to-Earn system was managed manually by KevinOnEarth999 to viewers and reporters; NFT/Crypto/Wearable Rewards. This grant we will create features to automate those processes.\nhttps://kevin-on-earth.gitbook.io/the-decentraland-report-or-a-p2e-news-channel/\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xa4244F6711052752E6Bb0271Bf17c756E6598406\n\n## Description\n\nMore members of our community have requested spots as Reporters, however with all the existing processes depending on manual execution by a single person it will be impossible to keep up with.\n\nOur goal in this next stage is to Decentralize the Viewer/Reporter rewards system to remove the need for one person, KevinOnEarth999, to execute and manage the processes necessary to maintain The Decentraland Report. In this way, we will ensure the ongoing preservation of our history through The Decentraland Report, and via the $REPORT token and our DAO we will be able to continue to decide as a community what direction to take. The Decentraland Report belongs to the people of Decentraland. This next step is crucial to furthering that ownership so in theory, we can continue to watch history unfold in our report for generations to come.\n\nIt is for these reasons that the following features have been identified as “must haves” in order to ensure a trustless automated reward system for The Decentraland Report. More importantly, our approach to developing these features through our partnership with Xpang.GG, will also allow any other community in Decentraland to leverage the same FOR FREE! In other words, our mission here will not only serve our community at The Decentraland Report, but every other community as well.\n\nTune in to our 1 Year Birthday Special where we announced our plans, and tokenomics doc! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS0M9dmEAF0\n\nInstead of creating a tool from scratch, we will add it as a feature to the Xpand.GG Community pages. The same way we solved the problem of counting score for NFTuesday, while also giving this feature to others, is how we aim to solve the problem of rewards distribution for communities. We can accomplish the above by building the following features listed in a detailed way in our Gitbook page:\nhttps://kevin-on-earth.gitbook.io/the-decentraland-report-or-a-p2e-news-channel/what-we-are-building-now/overview\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following features will be developed on so anyone can access them as well for their communities, via Xpand.GG\n\nAutomating Distribution for Reporter (Moderator) Token Rewards: https://kevin-on-earth.gitbook.io/the-decentraland-report-or-a-p2e-news-channel/what-we-are-building-now/reporter-token-rewards\n\nAutomating Distribution for Viewer (community member) Token Rewards: https://kevin-on-earth.gitbook.io/the-decentraland-report-or-a-p2e-news-channel/what-we-are-building-now/viewer-token-rewards\n\nToken Bidding for Content Requests: https://kevin-on-earth.gitbook.io/the-decentraland-report-or-a-p2e-news-channel/what-we-are-building-now/token-bidding-for-content\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nTeam information: https://kevin-on-earth.gitbook.io/the-decentraland-report-or-a-p2e-news-channel/guides/the-team\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nPrevious Requests and results, alongside current request and projected time for completion: https://kevin-on-earth.gitbook.io/the-decentraland-report-or-a-p2e-news-channel/what-we-are-building-now/funded-by-the-dcl-dao\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=71499ee0-99c5-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a)**",

    "body": "> by 0x667224bf91fab7546fe591d1cf80e860d1d06963 (defli#6963)\n\nShould the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis grant seeks to award NFTs to individuals who engage with the world outside the plazas and gaming areas. It encourages them to explore our houses, NFTs, billboards, ads, games, etc. with NFT awards for doing so.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n2,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x667224bf91FAB7546Fe591D1cf80E860d1D06963\n\n## Description\n\nI’ve explored the areas outside the plazas extensively, enjoying the unique world that Decentraland has to offer: Games, quests, and houses that would be unimaginable in the material world. In all those explorations, do you know how many people I’ve see outside the plazas (besides at the JP Morgan Chase house)? Three, and they were in one group.\n\nMany of us have properties, billboards, ads, and NFTs that lie dormant in the outside world. What’s the point of having these properties if no one is going to visit them?\nIn Decentraland, there is only one place outside a casino that gets much traffic: Wondermine Meteor Mining. Why does it get traffic? Because people can earn NFTs.\n\nTo get people to engage with our properties, NFTs, ads, billboards, etc., we need to encourage them to engage with the world outside the plazas and gaming areas. To do that, I propose that we provide NFT awards for earning badges for engaging with the larger world.\n\nSome possibilities:\n\nTraveler’s Boots that award a 10% speed increase. These can be earned by exploring 20 miles of Decentraland.\n\nCuriosity Cap – Awarded for opening 150+ UIs to outside websites. Provides 5% discount on Marketplace purchases.\n\nAdventurer’s Sword – Awarded for completing Graveyard Quest, Quest of the Alcoholic Scarecrow, etc. This sword can be used to gain access to a separate questing zone with NPCs to fight and where they can earn money to use to buy more NFTs.\n\nGamer’s Gloves - Awarded to people who achieve high scores at all selected games, including The Adventures of Koko Jones, the Dragon Rush, etc. These can provide a 5% mining bonus for Wondermine.\n\nA list of badges can be found in each user’s dashboard, as well as a checklist for each that shows what they need to do to earn the badge and the associated NFT.\n\nEach badge category can have multiple levels, for instance different boots for exploring 20 miles, 50 miles, 100 miles, all with different bonuses.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe framework for these goals already exist within Decentraland. The games are already there, the land, houses, and NFTs already exist, and the only necessary funding is for the creation of the award NFTs. Additional participation from the Decentraland Foundation will be necessary to make this a reality.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nAs yet to be determined team of 5 volunteers to come up with badge requirements and associated NFTs.\n\nNFT creator to make the NFTs. $2000 USD\n\nDecentraland Foundation assistance to implement the badges.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nAssemble a team of 5 volunteers to help develop these goals - 2 weeks\n\nTeam develops framework for the badge system (badge requirements and NFT awards) - 2 weeks\n\nCreation of NFTs - 2 weeks\n\nImplementation of Badge system by Decentraland Foundation - Uncertain\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a76eca80-974b-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a)**",

It launched as the **first NFT battle game on Ethereum in 2017**.\n\nWhen the original team decided to end development, the most passionate players stepped up and took over the project in 2019. This has been a community-driven project ever since.\n\nOur browser-based PVP battle game has steadily grown to over 280K registered accounts on ethermon.io. However, our most exciting and intensive development is our Ethermon District in Decentraland.\n\nOur mission is to turn the largest game-focused district (668 LAND) into the most active and immersive full-scale MMO-inspired experience in Decentraland.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xEe9A8b81B85e23c101776a8580D73002Dc4d8915\n\n## Description\n\nOur team has dedicated 11 months now to building the Ethermon District into the best MMO game possible — focusing on the gameplay experience before monetization. All of us in the DCL community are blazing trails through the challenges inevitable in this new frontier of metaverse gaming.\n\nThis project has come an incredibly long way since it began in 2017. For Ethermon to reach the full potential we saw when we decided to take over the project as players and community members, we are inviting all of you across DCL to join our community.\n\nThe funding requested would allow us to make key hires and server upgrades necessary to achieve the ambitious goals detailed in Alpha 2.0 and Alpha 3.0 of the roadmap below. We want to deliver these exciting updates on an expedited timeline for our community who has been with us since the beginning.\n\nLet’s make this a truly community-driven success and take Ethermon to the next level.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe launched the pre-alpha version of the Ethermon District in April 2021. Post-release, we have been improving it around the clock for nearly a year with a dedicated global team. You can now explore our extensive town center with your 3D-rendered Mons, enjoy regular community events, and battle PVE enemies in the first of 6 battle biomes.\n\n### Alpha 1.0\n\nThe Alpha 1.0 version of Ethermon in DCL involves a complete gaming ecosystem. The following features have now been completed.\n\n[Click here to visit the live Ethermon District at 79,52.](https://play.decentraland.org/?island=I8zjws\\&position=79%2C52\\&realm=dg)\n\n.\n\n> ### Complete Builds & District Development\n\n*   **Ethermon District Plaza** where you can hang out with friends and explore the buildings making up the foundation of our District's P2E ecosystem, now in active development\n*   **Battle Biome 1**: Forest theme, where you can battle PvE enemies for loot drops\n*   **Custom Player House** with unlockable features and upgradable content\n\n.\n\n> ### Complete Mon NFT integrations\n\n*   **60+ Mons** that are modeled, animated, and fully functional in DCL — on both Ethereum and Polygon\n*   **Live Display** of all Mon and PvE enemy stats\n*   **Mon Spawning** so you can instantly spawn any DCL-ready Mon in your collection\n*   **Implementation of  Mon Teams** to rebalance the game economy by making it fair for all levels of Mon holders\n\n.\n\n> ### Complete Game Mechanics & Ecosystem\n\n*   **Real-time, turn-based battles** with over 100 unique battle moves for your Mons\n*   **8 new types of PvE enemies** to challenge your Mons\n*   **50+ new types of loot** to win from PvE battles\n*   **Inventory System** to collect and display your items as you adventure , and an additional **Storage System** to organize surplus loot in your House\n*   **Ability to Craft & Burn Loot**, turning loot drops into either premium items or other rewards\n\n.\n\n[Click here to see screen captures of the above progress](https://imgur.com/a/HjMqrJe)\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n### Core Team\n\nOur core team includes game design, metaverse, and blockchain industry experts.\n\n*   **Eric (EB)**, Co-Founder and 3D Lead\n*   **Idon**, Co-Founder and Blockchain Tech Lead\n*   **Jamie**, COO\n*   **Ryan (Rmac)**, CMO\n*   **Nycolas**, Lead Game Designer & Front-End Developer\n*   **Inihility**, Full Stack Developer\n*   **Juxton**, Front-End Developer\n*   **Mohib (Mariana44)**, Back-End Developer\n*   **Polygonal Minds (Lau and Hugo)**, 3D Artists\n*   **Arpesh**, 3D Artist\n*   **Javid**, 2D Artist\n\nIn addition to our core full-time team of 12 listed above, we have grown to over 50  total part-time employees and passionate volunteers, including devs, artists, community moderators, and dedicated support agents.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### Q2 2022 — ALPHA 2.0\n\nIn final Alpha development, we will solidify the District’s resource-driven economy.\n\n*   **Biome Bosses** (see [teaser](https://youtu.be/Dy7KWfXfvvk))\n*   **Player Skills** to level up as you chop wood, mine ore, and fish for resources\n*   **Equipable NFTs & Wearables**\n*   **Consumable Items** for in-battle buffs\n*   **In-game Music, Sound effects & Feedback**\n*   **WebSocket Server Upgrade** to view other players' Mons, battle, and loot\n*   **120 Total Mons**\n\n### Q3 2022 — BETA 1.0\n\nOur full-scale Beta release is defined by a massive expansion of play-to-earn gameplay.

As mentioned in the previous abstract:\n\nI have been working on a story since the early 1980s.  I used it as the background story of a virtual world game idea I embarked on in 2008.  I planned to use Mindark's Partner Planet Program for Entropia Universe.   I was not able to raise the investors and capital need to buy into a Planet Partnership.  At that time, it was $2M USD.  Since then, that price tag went up to $6M.\n\nDuring that time, I recruited a volunteer team of designers and artists. Since we were unable to get funding, the project was shelved.  Recently, I started up again.  I successfully published the story, Children of Arla on Amazon.  My hope it to raise the funds this way.   I am also looking at Decentraland as a way to protoype the virtual world game.\n\nDuring the process from 2008 - 2014, the team fleshed out the concept, added to the base story, created art and models and built some prototype scenes in everything from Vastpark, Multiverse, CryEngine and now Unity.   Since I was never able to raise the capital we needed to solidify the contract with Mindark for the Partner Planet, I tried to build on my own in Unity.\n\nI speant time learning C# of which, I barely am starting to understand, as well as polishing my skills at 3D design and Unity 3D.   You may learn more about the Postmoderna efforts on my website at http://www.planet-postmoderna.com and about the book as well.\n\nI am hoping to rebuild a team to continue this project.  I need capital to do this.  I see Decentraland as a possibility for a prototype.  I am an advocate for virtual economies and currencies and have been intrigued by Blockchain applications.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nI have a full GDD that I am happy to share but might need an NDA to share it.  This has been my life's work and am uneasy to share specific details out of what is shown on my website.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nIncluded in some of the presentations on my website.

    "title": "IRL Events Including Terminals and Decentraland Speakers",
    "body": "> by 0xfad24dd7573986d827bda9c0171d37e19f6a9f94\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAt ETHAnglia we are committed to developing a community to progress the understanding, adoption, utilisation and furthering of web3.\n\nOver two events covering the MetaVerse, firstly, NorDevCon - the East of Englands biggest tech conference(17th June ) and our Gaming and the Metaverse event (21st June) event.\n\nOur team have experience of organising, managing and running events, we are looking for support from Decentraland to create a bank of  heavily marketed (a banner above the bank of computers) terminals to \"dive in\", as well as support confirmed speakers to attend our events.\n\nYou can view our ETHAnglia events page here - https://ethanglia.org/events and see the NorDevCon landing page here https://www.nordevcon.com/\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x3D53800346707B7F0c7bA3b2cA0dA1b9e951dCd5\n\n## Description\n\nOur project is a community building project, allowing us to build the interest, understanding and adoption of Decentraland in the East of England and beyond. It will allow individuals to experience Decentraland for themselves, as well as hear talks on the project at our community events.\n\nThrough the funding, this will allow us to bring Decentraland \"live\" to an event with an estimated 500 developers in attendance, as well as another event with 100 individuls (of all walks of life). This will cover Decentraland as part of the ETHAnglia community of events, including venue hire, getting our confirmed speakers to attend including travel (including @ahoiMalloy) and having heavily marketed Decentraland terminals to experience the metaverse in person.\n\nWe appreciate that the communities will only utilise the \"terminals\" for events (we plan to integrate Metaverse into future events, but this is something we are still planning, we wanted to be explicit with our deliverables for this application). To further the technology utilisation, will ensure these are put to good use by being used by scholars of our web3 academy when not in use by the events (https://ethanglia.org/education)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe project will fall into three major catagories:\n\nConfirming Venues and Speakers\n\nThe venue for NorDevCon is already confirmed and a preliminary speaker list including a number of high profile speakers is in the works. We have a confirmed meetup date for Gaming and Metaverse venue on the 21st June, which will feature a streamed to YouTube \"fireside chat\" on Gaming and the Metaverse with speakers such as @AhoiMalloy.  We are able to support international speakers for the meetup (21st June) via Zoom for the fireside chat, but would love more in person speakers.\n\nPreperation for Events\n\nEvent preperation is already underway due to the scale of NorDevCon. We have full use of the room used for the web3 track on the Friday and should we be succesful, this will include the Decentraland terminals, as well as live interviews for content creation.\n\nDuring this phase, we would need to spec and purchase the computers for free use at the events on Decentraland. Decide what activities, if any, we promote to engage within the Metaverse. Create banners to sit above the Decentraland area promoting what is happening. In previous years at NorDevCon, high score events on driving simulators have gained huge traction. We would love similar to occur for the Decentraland, with MANA being a prize.\n\nFor the 21st July event, we will need to source a venue (in discussions for ITFC in Ipswich), arrange food and drinks, arrange ticketing (both Meetup and via Unlock Protocol).\n\nDelivery\n\nSounds simple, but the delivery portion will make sure that members of the team are manning, organising and reviewing the use of the areas and making sure the maximum number of people are getting a good overview and use of the computers. Managing speakers, ensuring that tech is working etc.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nJames Adams\n\nJames has been supporting ETHAnglia since its inception. James is the community manager for ETHAnglia, has organised a number of events including the recent Tech and Beer event at FUEL Studios (https://akcela.co.uk/inaugural-tech-and-beer-norwich-event-roundup/ - the probable venue for the 21st). James supports with the ETHAnglia Twitter, Discord., etc.\n\nJames is the founder of Akcela, an incubator in Norwich City that supports companies (including web3) to develop, and grow (https://akcela.co.uk/business-incubator-norwich/)\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jamescharlesadams/\n\nDom Davis\n\nDom has been involved in startups and scale up tech companies and is an alumni of TechStars. Dom is a founding member of NorDev, has been a keynote speaker for a number of years and an experienced events director, having supported the creation and devlivery of NorDevCon through the years.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/domdavis/\n\nDom is also a NED and career supporter with TechEducators a full stack and web3 bootcamp, based in the Akcela incubator.\n\nhttps://techeducators.co.uk/web3\n\nTim Smith\n\nTim is a founding member of ETHAnglia and an expierienced developer. Tim brings years of development experience, and an understanding of the bootcamp process from both sides of the table and is finding his way in running and supporting events alongside the team.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-js/\n\nThe core team will be supported by the wider ETHAnglia committee.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMilestone 1: Now - March 11th - Confirming Venues and Speakers\n\nDeliverables to the team will be venue confirmation, invoice production for event venue and arrange travel for confirmed speakers for each event (we are looking to add to our lineup). This will include the topics to be covered and duration.\n\nMilestone 2: March 11th - May 31st - Preperation for Events\n\nDeliverables for this will be the outline of how the events will run as a document. This will demonstrate the use of the computers, what will be running (i.e. Decentraland event), how long each person will get to try out Decentraland.\n\nWe will through the phase agree internally the specifcation for the computers, as well as the marketing for Decentraland (we are currently thinking a wide banner to sit above the terminals). This will be agreed with Decentraland.\n\nWe will also outline the food and drink situation, have ticketing (free, but we do giveaways etc, and tickets are required) available and ready for the 21st, and update the community on its status.\n\nMilestone 3: Delivery\n\nDeliverables for this will be the events themselves, however, we will ensure that full visibility through our marketing (such as this video https://twitter.com/ETHAnglia/status/1492208434292404226?s=20\\&t=VuyzReIaoYHbmx3skzAlBA) are pushed to show the excitement and outcomes of the events.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9811ede0-94eb-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a)**",

I always keep an eye out for updates and news to contribute to the community. I was the first Brazilian to make tutorial videos of the Decentraland metaverse. I want to continue creating relevant content, as Brazilians have taken up a great deal of the metaverse and I believe that my content can contribute to helping the Portuguese language community at Decentraland to develop.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nI will post new content (minimum) 3 times a week.

    "body": "> by 0xa4244f6711052752e6bb0271bf17c756e6598406 (KevinOnEarth)\n\nDecentraland has allowed us all to connect in a new way, and although the ability to talk, type, and discover in Decentraland has evolved substantially, we are still very limited in decentralized movements.\n\nProblem:\nCurrently, all movements (emotes) avatars can do depend on those movements (/emote tik, tektonik, etc) being added by Decentraland’s Development team. This prevents the “expressiveness” of the community from leading the charge and bringing amazing things to the ecosystem. As the wearable market flourished once opened to the community by removing the centrality of wearable creation/publishing.\n\nSolution:\nJust as we have done with wearables, we should open nft emotes for creators to load their .fbx and other standardized movement files to be used by their avatars. This in turn would not only add a whole other dimension for creators to utilize, but it would also allow for additional revenues to return to the DAO from submission fees and royalties. This would add a new class of asset for Decentraland’s current and future users.\n\nImportance of movement:\nScience shows that a majority of how we communicate is through body language, and without allowing the community of creators to inject their creativity through that medium we are holding our users back in the very area we are trying to open to them; deep and meaningful ways to connect and communicate with others online.\n\nCase Study to Demonstrate Feasibility:\nSome barriers which have limited this from being a possibility is the access to movement data, which often is not very simple to access whether due to cost or proprietary reasons. For this reason it has been easier to have the movements hard coded, and as special surprises through the year.\n\nWith the expansion of uses within the web3 space, a new company MetaMoves has published NFTs which give the holder owner of the actual movement data, with standard files such as .fbx. They are already utilizing this to animate other avatars such as MeeBits, and the same could be realized for Decentraland Users. It would allow us to carry into Decentraland an important part of our identity. That goofy wave or dance move; if you don’t speak I may think you are shy, but if you stop moving… I’ll call an ambulance! Movement has a deep connection to being alive, let’s liberate movement and help Decentraland accomplish something no other metaverse has before.\n\n- Yes - I would like for the Decentraland Developement Team to prioritize building a UI/UX for creators to load in their own movements. \n- No - Continue to limit any emote creation/publishing to Decentraland’s own developers\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=6862f830-9051-11ec-831d-95af4f79cd2a)**",

We have extensive experience in the field of architectural design and 3D modeling. We work on projects all over the world mainly in the south of France, Canada and Florida. We are a young and dynamic team who master a lot of 3d design softwares (Sketchup, Rhino, 3ds max, Bim). We want to integrate the web3, and particularly the creation and the modeling of new and exclusive universes for our account, or on request for people, or if you have the need for it.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n50,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x8fb5dCeEcEa6B8137c64A4b751bfc93Ab6C2836c\n\n## Description\n\nWe created a model on the sandbox, then we looked at Decentraland which we find much more attractive, and the builder is very realistic. We will therefore focus in our next project on creation on the Decentraland builder. Attached are pictures of a model we started that we worked on for two days. This is a draft version. You will also find the character we created there. We tried to take into consideration several parameters by using a single level for the road, we created underground paths\naccessible from everywhere and a lot of other details that we studied on plan before\nstarting to model.\n\nhttps://www.canva.com/design/DAE4h_P32Ac/dsnOiC21XLO9PJWuQAWbgA/view?utm_content=DAE4h_P32Ac\\&utm_campaign=designshare\\&utm_medium=link\\&utm_source=shareyourdesignpanel\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOur models are made in a very thoughtful way. That is to say that we have meetings to develop plans, and we plan the whole project in writing before moving forward in the modeling. After testing creation in the virtual world we decided to focus on the metaverses. It is for this reason that we cannot decide overnight to move from creation in the real world to creation in the virtual world. We want to see if we can get help and funds to move forward even more in this project that we love and have been dreaming about for months now. We are ready to reduce our activity as an architecture company to make place for development in metaverses.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nallow me to introduce myself. My name is Eddy Chayata, I am the CEO of an architecture and interior design company based in Nice on the French Riviera named Maida. I have extensive experience in the field of architectural design and 3D modeling. I am personally in possession of a degree in architecture (7 years of study) then I specialized in interior\narchitecture, I obtained a second degree after two and a half years of study in Montreal.\nI am very interested in video games and all technological advances.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe are a young and dynamic team who master a lot of 3d design softwares (Sketchup, Rhino, 3ds max, Bim). We want to integrate the web3, and particularly the creation and the modeling of new and exclusive universes for our account, or on request for people, or if you have the need for it. We started by testing the main design platforms (Roblox,\nDecentraland, The Sandbox). So we wanted to know if it is authorized to create models and sell them ? We would have liked to have an opinion on the models we create to know if we have a future in this field. We want to know the steps to follow to evolve and grow our team to be among the first companies in Europe to carry out architectural projects in the metaverses. We are on the lookout for all the news, we are already using Oculus to discover metaverses in virtual reality and to organize the work of the group. We need your help to create the future. We have already purchased different cryptocurrencies that can be used in metaverses. We absolutely want to be part of this international revolution.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=61b1fce0-8f46-11ec-9794-c9ea21a9ed8f)**",

The key components of this project are to feature a LAND which will include mineable rocks that can be used to claim RUNIX tokens which can be swapped for MANA. This will give more opportunities for players to make money on Decentraland and help promote the MANA token. Many additional functions including NFT's full integration onto the LAND will enable users to gain bonuses when mining. This LAND will promote the growth of users on Decentraland and increase motivation to stay online because people will be making good money. I am the CEO of Runixcoin and our skills include professional programming development, and a great team\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n250,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x63948f87aef43558369aaf9e526201824052985f\n\n## Description\n\nFunding will be used to allocate LAND for Runixcoin and will be a LAND that contains many rocks that will be able to be mined within the Decentraland Game. The rocks that are mined will reward players with Runixcoin Tokens that can be traded on the Uniswap exchange platform. Integration of this LAND will allow users to swap between RUNIX and MANA and give more access for users to obtain MANA via different routes. This integration will bring many Runixcoin customers to Decentraland and full integration will be mind-blowing.  Current objectives are to help newcomers who do not know how to deposit Polygon MANA onto their accounts, Runixcoin Exchange platform is a way to help users to do this along with being able to actually profit while being on the LAND.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe project will be completed via creating the LAND and all of its components and have it linked to the Runixcoin Cryptocurrency Exchange along with the tokens. The tools and methods that will be used are Web3 and connections to the Runixcoin Cryptocurrency Exchange. There will be different tiers of Rocks that can be mined which will grant higher rates of mining of the Runixcoin Token. The Runixcoin Token will then be able to be swapped for MANA using the polygon network and Uniswap. Current progress includes full development of a cryptocurrency exchange platform that will be soon integrated into Decentraland upon approval.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nJordan Campbell\nPosition CEO\n\nRajman Mylee\nPosition CFO\n\nGeorgina Findlay\nPosition CIO\n\nSpencer Kashman\nPosition CMO\n\nBenjamin Figman\nPosition Financial Sponsor\n\nHayley Monroe\nPosition CSO\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nRoadmap will include completion of the LAND and the ability to claim RUNIX tokens to a Polygon (MATIC) Receivable Address. Progress that will be made will be given weekly, it will start with creation of the LAND. Next milestone will be adding different rocks that can be mined. These rocks after being mined will be converted into ore. The ore then can be used to convert into ingots which can be used to turn into Runixcoin Wearables that will be minted to users. Alternatively, the ingots can be converted into Runixcoin tokens which can then be converted into MANA or any cryptocurrency of choice, linked to the player's wallet. Full integration and updates will come weekly/as frequently needed, and long-term dedication to this project is at upmost importance to the Runixcoin Team. Updates will be posted frequently and long-term development will be key in success of this excellent project.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d7202560-8de8-11ec-9794-c9ea21a9ed8f)**",

This module will be made available to the community to help build up the repository of functional examples and to act as a starting point for new developers while providing a useful scene that can be freely implemented into existing land.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003\n\n## Description\n\nParkour is prevalent throughout internet and gaming culture. It spans many genres of games and has become a staple activity in even some of the most popular games (Minecraft and Roblox to name a couple). Decentraland has the potential to become a new hub for parkour creators and enthusiasts, but currently most implementations require a fair understanding of how to program.\n\nI hope to solve this through the development of a parkour creation kit that will allow users to easily setup parkour courses with a low knowledge requirement. The kit will offer a variety of features (different moving platform types/styles) that can be created by a user in a couple lines of code. Artistic users will find it simple to add more platform styles to the kit and advanced users can modify it to provide additional dynamic platform types.\n\nWe can reach a much wider audience by providing the advanced utility of the SDK without the requirement of programming knowledge. A module like this will create a great foundation for those looking to develop their own parkour tracks and foster Decentraland's parkour community! We can also continue to expand it by adding to its functionality over time, increasing the types of dynamic platforms and available styles.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis module will allow users to setup a dynamic parkour course, including platforms with dynamic moving patterns and styles. The core functionality of the module will be hidden from the user, making the creation of courses significantly easier. Advanced users will also find it easy to modify the provided repository to form it to fit their own need. The default/demo scene itself will showcase all the features available in the module, providing an example implementation for each component.\n\nThe currently planned features are:\n\\-Static platforms: platforms that do not move.\n\\-Moving Platforms: platforms that move along a designated course of way-points (A to B to A, repeating)\n\\-Rotating Platforms: platforms that rotate along a given axis and at a given distance from the pivot point.\n\\-Blinking Platforms: platforms that periodically blink in and out of existence on a timed delay.\n\\-Platform Styles: ability to define and assign display styles to platforms, modifying their appearance in-game.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI'll be working on this project solo. I've been programming for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). While I've only been developing in DCL for a relatively short period of time I have made good strides and am fully capable of implementing this project in the given time-frame. I've created several projects to learn the platform and have a good understanding of the development pipe-line.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis project will be competed within 2 weeks of this proposal's acceptance. The basic roadmap is as follows:\n\n\\-Week 1: Implementation of core features, rough demo scene made available for feedback. -Week 2: Scene/code polish, implementation of suggested features within scope.\n\nAs with any project, there will likely be bugs/flaws in implementation. I'll be maintaining the main repo and will work towards fixing these as they get flagged.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5701b9c0-8d25-11ec-b2d8-691324a163a7)**",

It will allow individuals to experience Decentraland for themselves, as well as hear talks on the project at our community events.\n\nThrough the funding, this will allow us to bring Decentraland \"live\" to an event with an estimated 500 developers in attendance, as well as another event with 100 individuls (of all walks of life). This will cover Decentraland as part of the ETHAnglia community of events, including venue hire, speaker setup and having Decentraland marketed terminals to experience the metaverse in person.\n\nWe appreciate that the communities will only utilise the \"terminals\" for events (we plan to integrate Metaverse into future events, but this is something we are still planning, we wanted to be explicit with our deliverables for this application). To further the technology utilisation, will ensure these are put to good use by being used by scholars of our web3 academy when not in use by the events (https://ethanglia.org/education)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe project will fall into three major catagories:\n\nConfirming Venues and Speakers\n\nThe venue for NorDevCon is already confirmed and a preliminary speaker list including a number of high profile speakers is in the works. We have a couple of options for the Gaming and Metaverse venue on the 21st June. This will need to be confirmed. Note that we would need a live speaker for NorDevCon (17th June) but have and are able to support international speakers for the meetup (21st June) via Zoom.\n\nPreperation for Events\n\nEvent preperation is already underway due to the scale of NorDevCon. We have full use of the room used for the web3 track on the Friday and are planning to use space for a Decentraland breakout space, as well as live interviews for content creation.\n\nDuring this phase, we would need to spec and purchase the computers for free use at the events on Decentraland. Decide what activities, if any, we promote to engage within the Metaverse. Create banners to sit above the Decentraland area.\n\nFor the 21st July event, we will need to source a venue, arrange food and drinks, arrange ticketing (both Meetup and via Unlock Protocol).\n\nDelivery\n\nSounds simple, but the delivery portion will make sure that members of the team are manning, organising and reviewing the use of the areas and making sure the maximum number of people are getting a good overview and use of the computers. Managing speakers, ensuring that tech is working etc.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nJames Adams\n\nJames has been supporting ETHAnglia since its inception. James is the community manager for ETHAnglia, has organised a number of events including the recent Tech and Beer event at FUEL Studios (https://akcela.co.uk/inaugural-tech-and-beer-norwich-event-roundup/ - the probable venue for the 21st). James supports with the ETHAnglia Twitter, Discord., etc.\n\nJames is the founder of Akcela, an incubator in Norwich City that supports companies (including web3) to develop, and grow (https://akcela.co.uk/business-incubator-norwich/)\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jamescharlesadams/\n\nDom Davis\n\nDom has been involved in startups and scale up tech companies and is an alumni of TechStars. Dom is a founding member of NorDev, has been a keynote speaker for a number of years and an experienced events director, having supported the creation and devlivery of NorDevCon through the years.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/domdavis/\n\nDom is also a NED and career supporter with TechEducators a full stack and web3 bootcamp, based in the Akcela incubator.\n\nhttps://techeducators.co.uk/web3\n\nTim Smith\n\nTim is a founding member of ETHAnglia and an expierienced developer. Tim brings years of development experience, and an understanding of the bootcamp process from both sides of the table and is finding his way in running and supporting events alongside the team.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-js/\n\nThe core team will be supported by the wider ETHAnglia committee.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMilestone 1: Now - March 11th - Confirming Venues and Speakers\n\nDeliverables to the team will be venue confirmation, invoice production for event venue and confirmed speakers for each event (we are hoping someone from Decentraland). This will include the topics to be covered and duration.\n\nMilestone 2: March 11th - May 31st - Preperation for Events\n\nDeliverables for this will be the outline of how the events will run as a document. This will demonstrate the use of the computers, what will be running (i.e. Decentraland event), how long each person will get to try out Decentraland.\n\nWe will through the phase agree internally the specifcation for the computers, as well as the marketing for Decentraland (we are currently thinking a wide banner to sit above the terminals). This will be agreed with Decentraland.\n\nWe will also outline the food and drink situation, have ticketing (free, but we do giveaways etc, and tickets are required) available and ready for the 21st, and update the community on its status.\n\nMilestone 3: Delivery\n\nDeliverables for this will be the events themselves, however, we will ensure that full visibility through our marketing (such as this video https://twitter.com/ETHAnglia/status/1492208434292404226?s=20\\&t=VuyzReIaoYHbmx3skzAlBA) are pushed to show the excitement and outcomes of the events.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=eeb84ba0-8c15-11ec-b2d8-691324a163a7)**",

I then moved on to remap for play in Decentraland- the result was a lot better than i had  really thought possible.Its given me the ability to play in the metaverse just as i would in any other 1st person exploration game.  Ive also provided a remapper easy enough to use that it wont require explination. Xbox is 100% finished, Im now looking to include playstation- to draw more to  controloer heavy. users.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x547849942c3Ea64151986b77Fe2A34B8cD569D6F\n\n## Description\n\nI believe giving control dominate players the option to use the  devices they are accustom to would have an immediate impact on new player accusition . Providing the community the ability to participate in the style of gameplay they are most comfortable  will eliminate one of the biggest reasons ive personally heard,  not being forced to use a keyboard and mouse- thus shortening a learning curve, will shift a potential players midset  from \"ahhh- i dont want to go through all of that right now...\" as they then move on to continue playing COD. To viewing it as, \"its right there-, ill give it a shot, why not\"... and anyone thats had xbox live understands the mental process im speaking of.  I personally believe providing this to users would result in more users opting to try Decentraland than just about any other ad campaign- im almost certain of that. Plus considering I have it more than half finished, (i can provide gameplay samples if youd like) Could be implemented within a few weeks at most. thanks for the support from those of you i have already spoken with, im anxious to see how the rest of you feel about it- i look forward to it. - thanks.\n\n\n## Specification\n\ni have everything available upon request, being as im not accredited, i probably dont have  the exact terminology and technical documentation, the result of my work will speak for its self- its performing without any flaw, no bugs, lol no copyright violations- i assure you its in good standing . i have practical use and gameplay videos to confirm my claims.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nha im just a single dad to three kids, my 3rd was just flown to pit hospital on the 27th because she had polycythemia, no worries shes good now. 38,600$ for a 40 minute helicopter ride if youre curious, its a joke- im just still releasing stress and im seriously just happy shes here with us now. what made me mention this- is the whole reason i even began this project, and that was- my 4 year old ella, always wants to be included no matter what it is im actively doing. well i started playing Decentraland , and she kept asking to try and of course im going to little things like this make her so happy, but she would trash everything- and i mean everything... 9/10 time just totally exiting out of where i was, i think she might have bought an nft.. but ultimately i decided something had to be done, so i just dedicated my free time to finding a more enjoyable experience for her (me) so thats how i got here- ive been coding and modding ,designing you name it, ever since i was a kid, im one of the late 90s early 00s pro opensource ,stick it to the man teen hackers, lol- then i had to work for him, im sure the story is all too familiar...but yeah, its just me on this project an thats all i forsee moving forward-  what ive completed  thus far is working than better  i could have hoped for... every action can be remapped in the manner you wish. just need to finish and release it.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nI have more than 60 % finished, it wont take me more than a few weeks 3 is the absolute Max, ( and thats an excessive estimation -just to give myself room incase something crazy and unexpected happens)- the hardest part was locating and patching the bug in windows. From here i just plan to include  playstation  dual shock, make it compatible, test it- test it more, zip it up, then release it  and eliminate excacuses, lol.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4c1eb3b0-8bfd-11ec-b2d8-691324a163a7)**",

    "body": "> by 0xec1213e0b47ff5f7abc12053035e41736464ac3a (CieloCapalini#ac3a)\n\nThe new Skins category allows for full body outfits, which by default hides 4 wearable slots (Upper, Lower, Feet, Head).\nThe information given previously for creations combining these slots is that the limits of each could also be combined. So for these four slots, this would previously give a total of 6k tris, 8 materials and 8 textures.\n\nGiven the need to keep DCL running smoothly, 8 mats and textures would be an excessive load, but limiting to 5k tris is the bigger impact here. When you factor in hair and clothing on top of body parts that may still need to be showing, as well as back faces for undersides of clothing that are visible, being able to be freely creative is made difficult.\n\nLeaving the limits as they are discourages people from using the new skins category and instead loading full body outfits into the upper slot and hiding the other slots as they have been doing already, so they can still use up to 6k tris.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0d57a210-8962-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123)**",

The early roll-out of NFTs in Decentraland has had a grey cloud over it for a long time.\n\nMy proposal today will hopefully clear that cloudiness and restore the once prosperous NFT community back to its former glory, which will include righting a few mishaps that Decentraland, and now the DAO, had made.\n\nBefore jumping into the proposal, it is imperative to highlight these points of contention.\n\n\\[Point of Contention]\n\n1.  Decentraland’s DAO stands to profit from the earliest adopters; the user-acceptance testers that had carried the torch to get here, by collecting secondary market fees and not redistributing them back to the community and artists of the later collections.\n\nAs a double standard, they will not do this for L2 wearables, as they are provisioning these sale fees back to the artists or whom the creator delegates them to\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttps://twitter.com/decentraland/status/1478826253239169025?cxt=HHwWgsC9zYyp7IUpAAAA\n\n\\[PROPOSALS]\n\nNow that we’ve cleared the air on the points of contention, let’s jump into the proposed solutions.\n\n1.  Delegate L1 Wearable secondary fees that have been collected from L1 Wearables community to a smart-contract DAO structure\n\nThe DAO itself would be a standalone DAO, not governed by Decentraland’s DAO. The only action Decentraland’s DAO would have is setting up a new contract that points the secondary fees from OpenSea et al to the new L1 Wearables DAO.\n\nUpon creation of the DAO, an L1 Wearable snapshot would be taken, and holders of L1 wearables, prior and up to the snapshot being taken, would be issued governance tokens for the DAO.\n\nThe DAO could then vote on dispersing those funds to holders of the governance token, delegating them to a representative, and voting on other project initiatives such as creating an L1 Wearables Museum in Decentraland.\n\nFor the L1 Wearables DAO Governance Token proposal, I think we can get more granular, in terms of token weightings, by creating a more complex algorithm based on factors like:\n\nOwns more than 2 items from multiple collections\nHas sold an items on OpenSea/Decentraland’s Marketplace\nNFT Count\nWeighted Collection Date Average (ie are most of your L1 wearables from the first collection or last collections on L1 – were you an early adopter)\n\n\\[Closing Remarks]\n\nAs with all proposals, please provide constructive feedback.\n\nWe need to push forward as a community and L1 wearables has quite the storied past. As stated in my other proposal, I believe there's a symbiotic relationship between adoption and a healthy, robust wearables market.\n\nLet's revitalize this community and push for the decentralization that we promised each other; a better tomorow, which starts with decentralizing revenue streams from the L1 Wearables.\n\nCheers,\nSuperMANA\n\n- Approve Transferring L1 Royalties to a L1 Wearables DAO\n- Reject Proposal\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=61a89ee0-8873-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123)**",

    "body": "> by 0xdab85506424396fb090d84b64ad63b770d87c028 (SuperMANA)\n\nFor those who have been here since inception, or rather close-to, have had the unique opportunity to watch Decentraland blossom into the iconic metaverse platform that it is today.\n\nThe nascent success that it’s experiencing today wasn’t a straight-forward path, and many community members here can attest to that.

Decentraland, before the DAO, sold NFTs to the community, requesting MANA in return.\n\nOn the surface, this looks like a normal transaction; however, Decentraland’s exchange here was hostile as it never reward Voting Power for these NFTs, unlike LAND & NAMES, that were sold in exchange for MANA and hold Voting Power.\n\nBy doing this, Decentraland fully attacked the democratic abilities of the NFT Wearables community, suppressing them from holding Voting Power/NFT equivalent Voting Power to defend their community and promote their rights.\n\nFurthermore, the DAO, highlighted this negligence by accepting Ethereum at a fixed $10 USD parity amount for the COVID Mask event. Here, they pegged the NFT price to USD and also did not accept MANA.\nhttps://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/decentraland-binance-against-covid19/\n\nThose who were asked to purchased NFT wearables in MANA for the Halloween 2019 collection were hurt the most by this decision.\n\nMajority of the collection was sold, not acquired via play-to-earn methods. The prices were as follows:\n\nMythic Items: 5,000 MANA\nLegendary Items: 500 MANA\nEpic Items: 100 MANA\n\nThe items and original address can be found here:\nhttps://opensea.io/0x93a7c46443901c2ea2fc1263a4d076f470695d3a?tab=created\\&search\\[sortBy]=CREATED_DATE\\&search\\[resultModel]=ASSETS\\&search\\[sortAscending]=true\n\nUpon the launch of this predominantly-purchase only collection, admins in Decentraland’s Discord “advertised” how to access OpenSea and buy these items set at the *market* price, which turned out to not be sticky.\n\n2.  Developer/Admin/Foundation Member(s) of Decentraland sold their wearable NFTs to the community in exchange for MANA, often farming them before other community members could acquire them. There’s on-chain and YouTube history of this for the Xmas 2019 and Moonshot 2020 events.\n\nTo gain bipartisanship in this matter, I will withhold naming these particular members of the team for now and not share the recently curated Google Doc detailing the advertisement of wearables on OpenSea and Admins selling them to the community. Nonetheless, it is disappointing how certain individuals dumped on the community and rose to prominent positions within the DAO without any recourse or apologizing.\n\nIt is imperative to highlight this issue, as it showcases the poorly designed incentives that members of the team have to care about the L1 Wearable community, as many have sold a good portion of their NFTs, especially their earliest, most rare mints.\n\nAs an ombudsman for the wearables community, a resounding comment that has been made frequently is: “Paper hands are never rewarded, and the community expresses little sorrow in knowing that we had higher expectations of this project than those members of the project who dumped their NFTs on the community.”\n\n\\[PROPOSAL]\n\nNow that we’ve cleared the air on the points of contention, let’s jump into the proposed solutions.\n\n1.  Grant Wearables Voting Power\n\nA flat amount of voting power per each L1 Wearable is the simplest solution, as the devs have mentioned; even though, Decentraland’s unique property design for wearables complicates this.\n\nDAO Weighting for L1 Holders:\n\nAccording to the data I pulled from GraphQL (this data should be validated by the community), the distribution is as follows for rarity type:\n\nUnique             |\t             4   |         0.005%\nMythic\t     |          984   |       1.224%\nLegendary     |   13,229   |    16.449%\nEpic\t             |   28,775   |    35.780%\nRare\t             |   25,713   |    31.972%\nUncommon   |     6,309   |        7.845%\nCommon\t     |     5,409   |         6.726%\nTotal\t             |  80,423   |      100.00%\n\nWe sit on the shoulders of giants; those who came before us. Under this premise, I feel that pioneers of Decentraland should be rewarded for their time and bravery. For those just joining the community, there have been many moments along this journey where community members have shared losses.\n\nVoting Power should be assigned in a two-tier ranking system, in an easy to assign manner for the Decentraland developers.\n\nWith this in mind, I propose a two-tier Voting Power weight.\nBeing the first collection, the Exclusive Mask collection, stands out in this regard. In addition, since the Halloween 2019 collection was a primary-purchase only collection, which hindered the democratic of many L1 holders, this collection should also be in that tier.\n\nBeing that the Xmas 2019 was a bugfest, I also propose including this collection into that same standalone tier. Lastly, to be included, should be the MCH (MyCryptoHeroes) collection, especially after some of the collection was incorrectly listed under the Mythic background color, which hurt many buyers.\n\nAll four of these collections were minted in 2019. Please note the 2019 weightings coincide with prices that Decentraland charged for the Halloween 2019 collection, save for rare(s) which were not sold but scales with proposed mint count.\n\n2019 Collections                    | Voting Power\nMythic/Exclusive Masks    | 5000\nLegendary/MCH                     | 500\nEpic\t                                           | 100\nRare\t                                           | 10\nUncommon\t\t                   | N/A\nCommon\t\t                           | N/A\n\n> 2019 Collections                 | Voting Power\n> Unique/Mythic                        | 1000\n> Legendary                                   | 100\n> Epic\t                                           | 10\n> Rare\t                                           | 2\n> Uncommon\t\t                   | 1\n> Common\t\t                           | 1\n\nAs with all proposals, please provide constructive feedback.\n\nWe need to push forward as a community and this has been quite the gray cloud. I believe there's a symbiotic relationship between adoption and a healthy, robust wearables market. We've listened to Discord admins incorrectly state that Decentraland slowed down because of gas fees. It's time for the community to rally and restore faith in Decentraland's wearables.\n\nLet's promote and push for the revitalization of these historical pieces of art in Decentraland and the blockchain space, before the next 10,000 opts for Meta as their only platform.\n\nCheers,\nSuperMANA\n\n- Approve Voting Power for Wearables\n- Reject Proposal\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ab106370-8872-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123)**",

And I would be honored to create its statue in Decentraland. If the Community likes the design of the statue, it could have been placed in the main spawning spot to kind of \"welcome\" all the guests of Decentraland. Hopefully, it would be eliciting positive emotions and spreading the good vibes and atmosphere of Love and Care all over Decentraland!\n\nOver time, this statue could probably become one of the notable meeting spots or even one of the symbols of Decentraland, like the Eiffel Tower of Paris. Who knows, maybe people would even start taking v-selfies (virtual selfies) beside this statue :)\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4cB45d74b891db3ae1CEADda55491A58aeA6371c\n\n## Description\n\nBenefits to Decentraland:\n\n1.  Building the Statue of Love can make the spot (where it will be located) more unique and notable. It can turn into an interesting meeting spot that attracts more people to Decentraland.\n2.  It can create a buzz in the media :) like \"Decentraland has got its own statue of love! What's next??\" or something like that.\n3.  This statue has a good story behind it. This will be a statue of Mikasa Ackerman (from the Attack on Titan anime TV series). Please read the story down below.\n4.  Due to the fact that the statue is related to the Attack on Titan anime series, and I believe, has an impactful and emotional story behind it, it can attract the audience of the Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) TV series, which currently is THE most popular anime in the world with millions of people in its fandom. Also, the timing is just right, because for the time being the long-anticipated season 4 of AoT is finally on air.\n\nTHE SHORT STORY BEHIND THE STATUE\n(spoiler alert)\n\nMikasa Ackerman is sitting next to Eren's grave while wearing the precious red scarf that Eren once gave her. This is the final scene of Attack on Titan manga, Chapter 139, where Eren after his death came in the incarnation of a bird and wrapped the scarf around Mikasa as he promised.\n\n\"I will wrap that scarf around you as many times as you want, now and forever\".\n\n*   Eren to Mikasa.\n\nHOW I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA\n\nThis statue was my first personal project that I never finished till the end. I had an idea of making a 3d printable miniature for sale out of it and I even placed some work-in-progress images of it on my IG back in late May of 2021.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPIuFxDD3aF/\nBut since June 2021 I was very busy with my freelancing projects so I never had a chance to actually finish the statue and offer it for sale. So in this regard, it's a unique piece of work and was never sold to anyone.\n\nThus, here I am with my model of Statue of Love and I'd like it to be my dent in the universe of Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis work is 90% finished, but I want to take 3 weeks to polish it and give it a more finished look.\n\nYou can check the work-in-progress images with the current look of the statue in my Google Drive that I created especially for you guys\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X-xNmYEPM5-RmUSQMF37pOjz6AYnaXpl?usp=sharing\n\nIf you're interested to check some of my works, please visit my Artstation\nhttps://www.artstation.com/deniz_kudayar\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI will be working on this project alone. To judge about my skills and experience please visit my Artstation\nhttps://www.artstation.com/deniz_kudayar\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe model of the statue is 90% finished in regards to the modeling.\n\nI just need some polishing to do, to give it a more pleasing and finished look.\\\nThis project will take me 3 weeks maximum. Although I'll probably finish it earlier.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fe9124a0-8857-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123)**",

Just like in the analog world we create art and add it to our skin in a way that lasts forever, we'd like to make it possible for avatars also to have this means of expression.  We believe tattoos are a powerful means of expressing oneself -- as a snapshot of a moment in time, an important feeling, in memory of something, as a reminder, or just for fun. We have an amazing team of skilled developers, VR artists, marketers, and a large collective of analog tattoo artists who will contribute their unique tattoo styles to this project.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n50,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xCEC89Fd1738fa6AB7C90fDD2Fde18d8eb5dE9779\n\n## Description\n\nTaking analog artists in the tattoo world and helping them have their first experience with the metaverse, NFTs, and Web3 is a passion project we are excited to bring to fruition. It's one of the areas we think is most interesting since many of these artists have yet to enter this space and create tattoos that can be used in the metaverse. We believe that we can empower this unique group of physical artists to enter this area and support them by transforming their craft into something that can be used on virtual avatars. For Decentraland users, this will create a new layer/way for them to express themselves -- just like we do in the real world. It will make avatars stand out and be themselves (or whoever who they'd like to be). As another layer of expression, this will differentiate Decentraland from other platforms and allow for further self-expression for users of the metaverse.\n\nWe know that the time is now:\n\n1.  To create an easy process to allow physical tattoo artists to break into Web3 and the metaverse via the Decentraland platform\n2.  To support these artists in this new realm and make it easy for them to convert their craft to something that fits Decentraland's avatars\n3.  To build out a method to add the relevant normal maps and technological specifications to make tattoos visually appealing in Decentraland\n4.  To give users the opportunity to further express themselves in Decentraland with tattoos just like they do in the physical world\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAs a new project we are currently in the researching stage. Our team has VR artists and developers who are passionate about making our concept a reality. We already have a group of tattoo artists who are working on their unique art for this project and our VR team will be transforming their art into VR versions ready to be implemented on avatars in Decentraland. The development team is ready to work with Decentraland to find the best technological solution for how we can integrate into your platform and provide added value to your users.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nWe're a team of established professionals around the world with experience in various industries and professions. We've come together to devote our collective energy to this project and are excited to take this step with Decentraland to make our vision happen.\nSara - Startup founder, Strategist and Organizational Consultant who is leading the team and our collective vision for the project.\nAmit - Analyst, Marketer and Tattoo enthusiast who is leading the artist collective and bringing in talented tattoo artists from around the world to join our DAO and cause.\nMarielle - AR/VR digital designer and classically trained artist using her creativity to help each artists transform their work for the best visual experience in the metaverse.\nVlad - Graphic designer and artist who is leading our brand and visual identity.\nNik + Mike - our software development team who is leading the smart contract development and integrative code that will allow us to flawlessly work with Decentraland\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nTeam building - by March 1\n\\-We will expand our team to add additional designers, marketers, and community managers to help grow our following and prepare for our launch.\nTattoo Collective Art Development - by March 20\n\\-Our tattoo artists collective is working on their art to be part of the initial collection.\nVR Art Creation - by April 10\n\\-We will adapt our artists artwork to fit the avatars in Decentraland to provide the best virtual look and feel for each tattoo.\nDevelopment for platform integration - by May 1\n\\-Our development team will develop and execute on our integration into the Decentraland platform.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8d78d820-8849-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123)**",

I am learning as I go, but I do have a vision and goal. I want to purchase land as a start. I want to build on that land for community members to visit and promote their projects. I want to point toward the direction of an NFT gallery/auction house, where people can visit, see and purchase other people's NFT projects and other projects that can be incorporated. People can hangout at the gallery \"Grand Central\" and work on growing the community. Schedule NFT showings/auctions at certain dates and times for all to come visit, see and purchase other community members' projects.\nSome time in the future, the gallery can expand and incorporate other projects, but I have to crawl before I can run.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I am new to this arena. I am a Systems Administrator by day and learning/researching about projects, Decentraland, NFTs, etc., at night and I have no team yet. I will be starting this project on my own and hope to grow a community to help build the Grand Central. I have given myself a six month deadline to erect the Grand Central. I might be in the early infancy stage in this arena, but I gave myself a six month deadline.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nI have given myself a six month deadline to purchase land, create property to house NFTs and other projects, if compatible.\n1st month: Purchase Land/Parcel. Research what I can build on the parcel.\n2nd month: Develop a community on Social Media and Discord to help me develop the Grand Central\n3rd and 4th month: Create NFTs, build on the parcel. Post NFTs on the Grand Central, along with community members' projects.\n5th month:  Purchase more parcels, continue growing the community. Announce grand opening and schedule first showing/auction.\n6th month: Grand Opening of Grand Central.\n\nThank you,\n\nBest regards,\n\nAndrew Ramirez\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=489d9d30-8821-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123)**",

We have assembled a technical team to start with the DRM (digital rights management) process, developers to help with the creation of the space and signed commitments with independent content creators to feature their content exclusively within our space.\n\nWe are predicting the space to be fully operational by the 1st quarter of 2023 with smaller rollouts of socially conscious content by the 3rd quarter 2022.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b8dc2270-86e5-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123)**",

DCL implements a smart contract to mint a corresponding NFT for each subdomain and allow the NFT owner to claim the subdomain (in case of transfers). These NFTs are then used to identify if a user owns the name or not, and if they do, they can set it as their Avatar Name.\n\nWith a few changes, DCL can allow subdomains of the dcl names to be minted as NFTs and integrate them into the naming system to allow names like xxx.name (the corresponding ENS subdomain would be xxx.name.dcl.eth)\n\nThe Name Registry smart contract is already designed in such a way that it could theoretically work to mint subdomains for any base domain (or subdomain). Implementing this change would just require a slightly modified version of this contract to exist along with the base names. NFTs generated through new smart contracts can then be included in the naming system.\n\nNote: if someone wants to enable subdomains for their name, they would have to transfer ownership of the name to a smart contract.\n\n- Allow subdomain names for DCL names to be registered\n- Do not allow it\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b8978790-85a1-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123)**",

    "title": "[DRAFT PROPOSAL] Decentraland Olympus Pro Partnership",
    "body": "> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)\n\n*This proposal was drafted by the Olympus DAO Partnership Team in coordination with the Decentraland DAO Facilitator. The DAO facilitator’s support in the drafting of the proposal is not an endorsement. This is a Draft Proposal, and will require 2M Votes to be promoted to the final voting stage.*\n\n**Summary:**\n\nWe are proposing that Decentraland DAO participate in the Olympus Pro program. Through Olympus Pro, Decentraland can diversify the treasury, accrue liquidity for key liquidity pairs, and create new revenue streams for the DAO.\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nOlympus Pro is a bonding service which allows partner protocols to acquire liquidity on token pairs while offering users discounted tokens in return. At the time of writing, Olympus Pro has helped over 24 protocols amass over 16M worth of liquidity.\n\n**What are the protocol benefits of this new bonding mechanism?**\n\nFor the protocols there are a number of benefits. One of the primary benefits is creating a new revenue stream for the DAO. By owning the liquidity, the DAO will start to capture the trading fees. At the time of this writing the 24 hour volume on the MANA-ETH pair was $4 million dollars, the DAO sees none of those fees.\n\nAdditionally, since there is no longer a need for extreme inflationary token incentives MANA will have a protected liquidity floor. This helps to protect from illiquid markets and creates a better trading experience for token-holders due to minimal slippage.\n\nFinally, the Olympus Pro program helps Decentraland gain exposure to the Olympus community! Decentraland and Olympus are two of the biggest communities in the Metaverse and DeFi industry. We believe it would be the perfect partnership to broaden both communities and to create a truly powerful decentralized ecosystem for both Olympus and Decentraland.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n*What are the benefits for the community?*\nGives the community the opportunity to buy discounted (~5-10%) tokens in exchange for providing the protocol a liquidity position. This provides a truly positive sum interaction between the protocol and community. In typical liquidity mining the protocol pays out their token for individuals/entities to temporarily provide liquidity. With Olympus Pro the Decentraland still pays out it’s token but receives an LP/asset in return. A win-win for both parties!\n\nAdditionally, the community will not have to suffer through impermanent loss. Impermanent loss describes the temporary loss of funds occasionally experienced by liquidity providers because of volatility in a trading pair. With Olympus Pro they simply provide an LP position to the protocol and receive MANA in return! The MANA is linearly vested over a typical time period of 7 days - meaning the discounted MANA accrues over a 7 day period, and can be used freely at the end of this period.\n\n*How can it help Decentraland?*\nControlling Decentraland’s own liquidity will support sustainable growth and can create new revenue streams for opening reward emissions for its users.\nIncreased revenue streams for the further development of the protocol. For example, on December 6, trading fees on X for the ETH-MANA LP pair were $12,060 USD. If Decentraland owned the liquidity for this pair, these fees would go to the DAO treasury.\\\nRemoves the need to create high inflationary rewards for liquidity mining\nAllowing multiple bond pairs with MANA (reserve or LP) would diversify your treasury, thus allowing for more complex DeFi strategies to create sustainable growth that is essential for these protocols to keep incentivizing users to play the game\nControlling your own liquidity decreases your dependency toward financial backing (VCs, private investors, etc) and gives more power to the DAO and its community\nThe tokens which Olympus earns as fees (3.3%) will never be sold and the community is willing to delegate the governance to entities voted on by the decentraland community\nPotential integration of Olympus within the Decentraland metaverse\n\nCurrent status of the Olympus Pro Program and it’s partners:\n\nWe have over 24 deployed partner projects on Olympus Pro with over 100 pending applications\nSome notable bond contracts which have amassed large amounts of total bond volume (TBV) are:\nAlchemix - $4.37M\nFrax - $1.97M\nPendle - $1.52M\nShapeshift FOX - $933K\nStake DAO - $877K\n\nOlympus Pro: https://pro.olympusdao.finance/\n\nA Beginner’s Guide to Navigating Olympus Pro:\nhttps://olympusdao.medium.com/a-beginners-guide-to-navigating-olympus-pro-5b1a9b710075\n\n**Specification:**\n\nFor: Create partnership with Olympus Pro\n\nAgainst: Do not create partnership with Olympus Pro\n\n- For: Create partnership with Olympus Pro\n- Against: Do not create partnership with Olympus Pro\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d166f800-8510-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123)**",

    "body": "> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)\n\n### Description\n\nWhile the wearables editor allows anyone to create wearables for Decentraland Avatars, all submissions must be reviewed and checked for technical issues or obvious infringements of Decentraland's content policies before they may be minted on Polygon and distributed. The **[Wearables Curation Committee](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/curation-committee/)** was formed to help with this process. The Committee is a group of individuals elected by the DAO who are responsible for reviewing and approving wearables submitted by the Decentraland community. Each member holds a key in a multisig wallet that is used to vote on the approval or rejection of each item submitted via the Wearables Editor.\n\nThere are currently only 6 members sitting on the Curation Committee, and the time and effort required to review submissions is exceeding their capacity.\n\nTo help guarantee that new wearables are reviewed and passed through the publication process in a timely manner, we need additional curation committee members.\n\n**The candidate**\n\nAfter the **[call for nominations](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearables-curation-committee-member-nominations/2047)**, Yannakis (<https://decentralwear.io/>), 3D Artist and wearable creator was nominated:\n\n<https://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0x233582b19c36e02b385cdf605e41ab9bb5bb9c45/items/0> <https://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0xdd044123fe5d058de8f7691506929d8881fc2944/items/0>\n\n**Compensation**\n\nOn August 20th, 2021, the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b)** to compensate each committee member with 50 MANA for every item they review. This compensation structure was modified on November 7th, 2021, when the **[DAO approved a proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)** to link the price of the wearable publication fee to approximately $500 USD and proportionally adjust the Curation Committee’s compensation to 10% of this fee.\n\nCommittee members are compensated per item reviewed (not hourly), and there are no hard time requirements. That being said, the current committee members are working between 10 and 20 hours per week. This workload is expected to change as the number of active committee members fluctuates.\n\n**Necessary qualifications**\n\nCuration Committee members must have previous experience that demonstrates their ability to provide high quality, technical feedback to creators. Specifically, committee members should have (at a minimum):\n\n*   Practical experience with 3D modeling and animation\n*   A full understanding of skin weighting\n*   A full understanding of the 3D asset pipeline for Decentraland wearables as documented here\n*   An understanding of the glTF asset pipeline\n*   A general understanding of the Decentraland platform and Decentraland's DAO\n*   A general understanding of blockchain transactions and layer 2 solutions\n\n**Should Yannakis be added to the Wearables Curation Committee?**\n\n- YES, add Yannakis to the Wearables Curation Committee\n- NO, do not add Yannakis to the Wearables Curation Committee\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d6e15b80-84d0-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123)**",

I am a recent graduate from fashion school and have taught myself how to use Blender to create wearables just for Decentraland. My goal for this project is to not only create inclusive clothing items but to give back to Decentraland by continuing to create unique and desirable clothing items.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4B75968043b77e01488ac98DA5d99Ebb0C2c73fe\n\n## Description\n\nI am a newer user to Decentraland and while I have greatly enjoyed it so far, I quickly noticed that the current clothing available lacks inclusivity and uniqueness. I have created a gender neutral clothing line that everyone will be able to wear and enjoy. This clothing line will bring a new standard for inclusivity to Decentraland.\n\nThis clothing line is based off of everyday street wear that still has uniqueness and creativity. The pieces are trendy, fashionable and the people wearing them will be proud to walk around and show them off. I am passionate about fashion and I am exciting to see how fashion is going to evolve in Decentraland. It is something that I greatly wish to be a part of and want to continue to release new pieces on a regular basis.\n\nAs a recent fashion grad, I want to use the skills that I have learned in a project that I really care about, like Decentraland. I believe that our future lies in the virtual world and Decentraland is at the forefront of this with their current product. With my background in fashion and schooling during this time of technological advancement, this something that I really wish to become a part of. The only component that I am lacking in my vision is the funding to make this possible.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis project is 100% complete and has been uploaded and tested in Decentraland builder. I used the wearable reference models available in Google Drive to create these pieces. I have spent countless hours teaching myself Blender to create quality pieces. I have also created all of the social media pages related to this project and have begun growing a community that supports my vision.\n\nThis is a link to two examples that I have created: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yhYg-qC6YkMTWMNzzoAf5zU7pzWGKBo7?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nMyself - I need help!\n\nI have taken this head on by doing my own research, learning from videos, and a lot of trial and error until I figured things out. I am passionate about fashion and want to make my footprint in the Decentraland fashion world. I have a degree from fashion school and I spend a lot of time keeping up with the current trends. Technology has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember and I am quick to pick up on how to use various platforms and softwares. I also have a degree in marketing and business administration which provides me with the knowledge on how to grow my community as well as manage the business aspect of this project. With all of this combined, I am confident in saying that this collection will be a success and I will be able to use profits from this collection towards future collections in order to keep up with the growth of Decentraland.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWeek 1-2 : Marketing: includes gaining a following and building hype around the launch date of my clothing line through Discord, Twitter, Instagram, and promotion from other content creators\n\nWeek 3-4 : Post collection for approval, continue to drop sneak peaks of the collection, and get people hype to make their purchases\n\nWeek 5: Throw parties in Decentraland where people will gather and show off their new outfits. More promotional actions will be taken during these parties to make people excited for the next time I drop a new clothing line.  I plan to have frequent fashion shows.\n\nI will do giveaways throughout this process to people who support me and are looking forward to my future collections.\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/s4gFZTR35D\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/denidnft\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/denidnft\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=65647d80-83d5-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123)**",

The proceeds will be used to buy a land an open up a free to play casino.  All guest will receive a set amount of tokens for playing once those tokens are exhausted they will then be offered the opportunity to buy additional tokens.

All code will be based on Unity and GIT Hub for the integration. I have many developers in the casino space with poker and slot games already developed.  This will save me thousands on leveraging these relationships for these items.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nAdam Lopez- Technical CTO I have been working in the technical space primarily around casino's for the last 20 years.

    "title": "Should decentraland dao move forward on acquiring a suitable public ENS domain? (like mana.eth)",
    "body": "> by 0xe809968423551135675f38ca77d9595c5d225918\n\nIt's my strong belief that virtually every person/corp/org/dao thats affiliated with crypto will want to pick up an ENS domain in the future. The domain chosen is a big decision as it becomes part of that entities brand. There's a big difference in brand effect from being beer.eth(https://bit.ly/3o7UgWH/) to b33r.eth. I believe mana.eth to be a strong contender for ideal domain for decentraland dao.\nI believe being forward thinking and swift moving is this area is going to be massively beneficial. As the market begins noticing increased demand, like any piece of scarce digital property, the prices could be driven up quite high. I think that's why people have been willing to pay a premium to secure powerful/clean domains(https://bit.ly/3s3oP15).\nSomething I would just like to point out, that I don't think has been realized yet, is the power of subdomains. The dao would be able to issue everyone their own subdomain of their choosing (i.e. jack.mana.eth, sage.mana.eth, etc) which the person could then put in their twitter profiles and such to show their support of the dao - I believe this will become very common place in the future.\nWe're still very much in the nascent stages of ENS development. Only a few coins can be assigned an address but in the future you should be able to send any coin to an ens address, from any chain and layer. Right now it seems dao's are largely sleeping on the importance of a domain, but once again I think in the future nearly every dao will want one.\n\nAs the current owner of mana.eth, my motivations are obvious, but I also strongly believe in the future of digital identity that ENS is building towards. I'm hoping to reach those who also believe in that future and perhaps have a bit of influence in the dao and encourage you to light the fire in this area and get your domain secured - whatever you collectively end up deciding it to be.\n\nP.S. - I've just found the dao already owns dcl.eth that it uses on its backend for ingame name registrations I believe? Well if the dao doesn't wish to use ENS in a public way, that's its own decision. But if I had a strong position in the dao, I'm absolutely certain of what my preference would be - I would want mana.eth shown on the dao's twitter page, and I would want as many members putting their subdomain in their twitter profile(and other socials) as possible. And I would want it to look like jack.mana.eth  over  jack.dcl.eth - one is very clear support for decentraland, the other is ambiguous and would clearly need the acronym explained until its understood what it is.\n\n- yes\n- no\n- maybe in the future\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=cbe90790-821a-11ec-9166-a5dd0ddb7cdb)**",

Guns and knifes are very common in some of the most popular games of all time such as GTA, Call Of Duty, Battlefield and many more. Guns can add possible nostalgia to games. For example creating a golden gun brings back memories of grinding on Cod for a cold camo.\n\nYes there are people who have experienced trauma from guns. But due to their popularity in video games they are detached  from the trauma they have caused. This does not mean that we forget tragedy's that have occurred around the world but instead it means that we associate guns with video games.\n\nMetaParty have already had a wearable approved and published named the Meta Soldier.

Me and a few like minded individuals are starting a company to educate both ourselves and the community about Nft's cyrpto currency and the metaverse. we intend on acquiring the most influential and long lasting aspects of these new technologies familiarizing ourselves with them and hosting both real world and in verse events to help people understand what all these things actually are. we aren't geniuses, billionaires, or avid gamers though we do have a passion for these things and though their is a lot we don't know theirs a lot we do compares to the average community at large. we want to be the bridge between cutting edge and the consumer so the things that are out their get to the indented user.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n239,999 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x32c03a3e1f5c7A42D504E1083cAE7E56d7060b36\n\n## Description\n\nAs stated prior we both intend to educate ourselves on tech as much as we intend to teach others. and out of the our big 3 subjects, crypto, NFT's, and metaverse, metaverse is our least knowledgeable area. we would use our grant to at first get better acquainted with all aspects of decentraland. provide community events and completions with reward both in the real world.\n\nOur end goal is to host real world conventions with fully educated and informed partners and companies to introduce people who are intimidated  by all the new tech and help them understand it. guest speakers, content creators, and developers, and classes. As a whole we believe theirs a lot of money to be made, yes very true. More importantly their is utility and potential for the average person to succeed and grow a community.\n\nBarbershop should give discounts to a specific nft holder of their own making, crypto can help businesses efficiency speed and metaverse is going to be where  people are at. but their are so many things possible and we genuinely believe it all starts with metaverse and Decantraland seems like a good fit for us.\n\nBecause of the technical nature of Decentaland its the most expensive to teach the amount of equipment we would need is a debate at this point. however we do know most people already own computers teaching them about crypto or nft's doesn't need any extra hardware. our focus would shift to decentraland and utilizing it for both showing the world its own capabilities but its auditory and visual capabilities make it ideal for eduating in general. if people new how to use metaverse, the covid homeschooling issue would have been virtually solved(pun not intended).\n\nwe believe whole heatedly there are a lot of problems in the world that already have solutions. People just don't know where to look for the answers. yes we want to  make money, yes success is our dream. But we are driven by our passion help and inform the community, and not by solving their problems, but by showing them the solution was already out there. you just have to learn about a few things to find it\n\n\n## Specification\n\nwe have a warehouse and office space dedicated to increasing our team, educating staff and storing event equipment and merchandise. our day to day consists of connecting with communities on social media and metaverse platforms promoting and providing content educating the average person. our real world events will be less frequent maybe bi weekly or monthly over the weekend after we are more established we can increase and expand\n\nWe are located in California close to l.a. so we are in a good area to start and we want to be nation wide have a team online and a team touring around. The touring team would host real world and  social media competitions and planned A.R.G. 's.\n\nthe online team would be involved in args as well, but more focused on the platform and utilize decentraland and the online conveniences to improve the communities understanding for the technology.\n\nIn short the in person events are for people who really don't know about this crypto, nft, meta thingy, and the online events are for those who want to utilize it the best they can. we just need the ability to provide the info and educate our staff on everything.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nRay:\nmedia tech and musician originally trying to see how to utilize nfts in music and the music community.  has apassion for technology and utili has a history of throwing events such as raves concerts comedy shows and conventions. Also the person submitting and typing out this form\n\nJacob:\nhead researcher and I.T. Jacob was early into the NFT game brought us on bored to them his contributions are what lead us to our goal\n\nRob:\nBusiness owner  Entrepreneur, Rob purchase the building, staff and equipment for our start up\n\nand staff of 7\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n1st month:  increase current staff sstart building accounts and following on nft servers and Decentraland\n\n3 months from grant: to educate staff and get a fully integrated online in decentraland and start a community team spreading the word about real world events upcoming\n\nset up competitions, meetups and classes in Decantraland\n\n4 months from grant release an arg  promoting clues needed to find for both in verse and in real life that lead to a grand prize spreading our name as they do so.\n\n6 months from grant : real world events and conventions and stuff added to the arg released\n\n9 months after grant: if no one has solved the arg the closest gets a prize and the arg is complete, the arg can still be solved and reward will be granted but no new clues.\n\n12 months after grant: new arg and company is fully realized\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=47d600d0-8165-11ec-9166-a5dd0ddb7cdb)**",

The purpose of this Decentraland project is creating and staffing open, accessible spaces for people of all skill levels and abilities to enjoy while taking away meaningful \"Real-Decentra\" (IRD) experiences and knowledge. This Tier 2 Request will be followed up with Tier 4 request(s) once infrastructure is in place.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x0F93Fd13D689Aecc25F25e3bA9fC2912B4DE81BF\n\n## Description\n\nDecentraland is in it's infancy and as it grows it will require the infrastructure needed to serve it's inhabitants and visitors. Education is a key component of life and our goals are to bring in real experts in education to work collaboratively to create educational institutions that serve the community and enable students of all types, abilities and backgrounds to share in the wealth of knowledge and our community.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe initial grant is intended to broaden our understanding of Decentraland and gain access to initiatives, physical locations, teaching materials and investors/donors when higher education institutions require expansion. The Tier 2 seed money would be spent on things needed to achieve our goal(s).\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI have taught special needs populations and educators in MI, WI, FL, WA and NV USA for over four decades and have a team of professors, teachers and paras who also share extensive knowledge in education, especially for those who struggle or have \"special needs\". Masters Degree from U of Michigan, PhD 1999 (Education, Analytics) is from Indiana (Go Hoosiers!) and we continue to consult and educate to this day. We believe we can make a positive difference in Decentraland for ALL of its inhabitants.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nInitial timeline would be six (6) months to evaluate and plan next phase, reporting back to the community every ninety (90) days. This $3,000 Grant  is only intended to be seed money while we seek to better understand the best practices for moving this forward. We foresee a time when we envision coming back to the community for larger Grants to be utilized for implementation of those plans...\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=07b07c30-8131-11ec-9166-a5dd0ddb7cdb)**",

This is caused by several external services targeting directly this server URL and not leveraging the catalyst network. As a result if there is a problem with this node, all services depending on it and consuming data from there will face problems too and, on the other hand, this node is using a lot of extra resources in order to respond to those requests.\n\n### HTTP requests qty in 1 week received by Host - January 2022\n\n| Host                                                                     | Requests                    |\n| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| peer.decentraland.org                               | 160.89M                   |\n| peer-lb.decentraland.org                         | 75.5M                         |\n| peer-eu1.decentraland.org                     | 20.39M                      |\n| peer-ap1.decentraland.org                     | 15.35M                       |\n| peer-wc1.decentraland.org                    | 11.39                            |\n\n### Proposal\n\n*   Change the current Catalyst server domain name from **peer.decentraland.org** to **peer-ec2.decentraland.org**.\n*   Make **peer.decentraland.org** be the Load Balancer while also keeping **peer-lb.decentraland.org** (as DNS CNAME). These 2 Domains will distribute the requests in the Catalysts network.\n\n### Impact\n\n*   Everything will keep working as it is.\n*   The change will be transparent, no updates will be required in external services or apps\n*   Higher Availability and Security for any App depending on the Catalysts Servers\n*   All services hitting **peer.decentraland.org** will end up leveraging the decentralized network, avoiding potential failures\n*   When doing an HTTP request to **peer.decentraland.org** or **peer-lb.decentraland.org**, the request will be distributed across the Catalyst Servers\n*   The Catalyst with the new domain name **peer-ec2.decentraland.org** will receive an equitative amount of HTTP requests, releasing a lot of HW resources from that node and with that it will better serve the users connected to it.\n\n- YES: Do this change\n- NO: Don't do it\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d21a2110-7ede-11ec-9447-6b730f00647d)**",

This is especially tedious when creating and placing new entities into the scene.\nWe are currently finalizing the development of a first stable version of DCL-Edit, a visual editor designed to work in parallel with the Decentraland SDK (see https://dcl-edit.com).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2a9Da28bCbF97A8C008Fd211f5127b860613922D\n\n## Description\n\nDCL-Edit enables you to instantly switch between coding and designing your scene, just like it is the case with modern game engines like Unity. This, of course, can dramatically increase the speed at which you code and design your experience for Decentraland.\n\nWith DCL-Edit, you can place, transform, scale, and rotate entities just like in Unity and give them identifiers that you can instantly refer to in your code. A visual asset browser gives you a nice overview of the available assets and lets you easily pick and place one into your scene.\n\nFeature Overview for this version\n\n*   place, transform, scale, and rotate entities\n*   add basic shape components\n*   asset browser for GLTF Shapes\n*   assign identifiers to entities\n*   undo functionality\n*   parenting of objects\n\n\n## Specification\n\nDCL-Edit is developed in Unity and will be downloadable as a npm package. It will be licensed under the MIT license. In its current state, the above features are already functional, but we need to put additional work into refactoring, testing and debugging to deliver a stable version.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nWe are developing this as representatives of the MetaGameHub DAO, a community that is heavily involved in the evolving Metaverse and Blockchain Space (check out https://www.metagamehub.io).\n\nSpecifically, we have 3 people working on this:\n\nJonathan Luebeck - Lead Programmer - years of experience in Unity\n\nMichael Gantner - Programmer, Shader Programming - years of experience in Unity\n\nChristian Werner - Project Lead - game developer and lecturer in Game Design\n\nTowards the end, we will execute an extensive testing period with more people.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe minimal requirements for a smooth workflow (see above feature lists) are already implemented, so in the next 3-4 weeks we will be working on a stable release version that everybody can seamlessly integrate into their workflow.\n\nAs a compensation for these last steps and as a sign of appreciation for the whole project, we kindly ask to receive a Tier 3 grant of $5.000 USD in $MANA.\n\nIn the future, DCL-Edit is planned to become a full-fledged editor for developing complex scenes with the Decentraland SDK. Coming features include\n\n*   UI-Editor\n*   Prefabs\n*   Improved Asset Management\n*   Improved Inspector\n*   and many more …\n\nSpeaking for the MetaGameHub community, we are of course open to cooperate with the Decentraland community beyond just developing a tool.\nWe’d happily collaborate towards fostering decentralization within the Open Metaverse by marketing and educational measures, the development of MetaFi tools, and onboarding talented Web3 developers from connected universities.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0cb35ba0-7e05-11ec-9447-6b730f00647d)**",

After a while, i didn't even want to wear the wearable that much.. These amazing NFTs are being devalued by the animation of walking and running when their feet doesn't touch the ground directly because of the wearable. Skateboard looks cool until you closer.. Sitting on a carpet or a cloud looks cool while you're standing still, once you move not so cool. Please keep the feet still or install a glide/hover type of animation for these different types of wearables.

Do we have a place in it?Primitive Africa was founded by Maurice Jp. Osarenren in 2020 and went Online in late 2021. Our sole purpose in the web3 is to act as community for information, research and innovations relating to web3 technology in Africa.\n\nAs native Africans, We believe that web3 technology will positively transform African societies by unlocking new commercial opportunities and improving individual access to a range of financial service and educational support for the skillful to share their innovative ideas.\n\nOur mission is to be an educational resource that provides access to information and to create an innovative community for Africans and Africa related creatives\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n40,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC3e564f67A2b6BD6361c55718c6268F9Ea37969E\n\n## Description\n\nThe African Web3 innovation (Community) is an interesting development because in the last 3yrs its had a growth of $5.5m to $14m and it's predicted to continuously grow at 20.41% annually to reach $20,256m in 2023.\n\nMy Community has issues, we know the problems and Primitive Africa will give solutions to all of these problems and takes advantage of this amazing Web3 to develop a place for innovators.\n\nWe launched last year and we've made $740, got 180 Positive reviews on Uhive and about 3200 members with great ideas with no resources, you can imagine what we could do if we have the resources.\n\nWhen we get funded this funding will help us grow, starting with our target for the first quatre of the year.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPrimitive Africa-\nAn online web3 community by creators for creators of African innovative ideas. We link up creators and useful information and tools to support innovative ideas made for African communities and others while equipping them with the right tools to Create, buy and sell easier, faster and more securely to a global audience interested in Africa related.\n\nOpportunities-\nThe Web3 community for African innovation is now estimated at US$1 billion, with\nthe accessible market standing at US$7,466 million. The gap is\ncaused by lack of proper visibilty, lack of access to market data, tools, and Information for creators and a population that is only just getting used to African\nonline web3 innovations. To address this challenge, Primitive Africa is leveraging its African market share and global market potential by using traditional\nbuying and selling methods to create a unique and innovative\natmosphere that reflects authentic African models and lifestyles and gather useful information in one hub at the same time.\n\nProblem-\n\n1.  Our creators or members is centered around the traditional ways Africans are used to in being, Creating and selling.\n2.  Small talented creators struggle to get noticed, they cannot afford the cost of Ads.\n3.  Limited access to web3|Decentraland|Metaverse data and trend to know what's selling and selling fast.\n4.  There is a long existing trust-gap between creators and clients\n5.  Not being able to search the right african version of things\n\nSolution-\n\n1.  Creators and tools that reflects the conventional ways Africans\n    are already used to in bringing your innovation to life, buying and selling.\n2.  We help to showcase creators creations to both local and global audience\n    at the same time buyers can shop creatives as african style wearable or E.t.c\n3.  We give innovators access to useful data and trends on web3 related.\n4.  Build trust and credibility\n5.

    "body": "> by 0x92e4f1731f2ef18856ed6592fcc0bf55f37c2e1f\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nPawnfi is a Non-Standard Asset platform that supports all the user to put their ERC-20 tokens or NFTs (721/1155) in work. That is, Pawnfi enables NFT/ GameFi/ Metaverse players to create Pawn (collateral loan), Lease (rent), and Sale purposefully or simultaneously within one transaction.\n\nBy supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place, Pawnfi will provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and enlightening builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than just \"buy and sell\" - in Decentraland Pawnfi can do bigger than that.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n30,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x6A44e6C59e2Fa54962e67a70Dd0A34FdC117Be85\n\n## Description\n\nCurrently, the pain point of Asset inventory is that other than buy/ build and sell, there is no other way for NFT holders or Metaverse players to create liquidity and cash flow.\n\nFor this reason, mirroring the practice in real world that how we treat with many of our assets (Real estate for example), Pawnfi supports users to make fully use of their ERC-20/ NFTs: Not only can use it to apply for collateral loan, but you can at the same time rent out to others, and/ or place it for sale. That is, liquidity will be unleashed in different dimensions.\n\nHowever, Pawnfi understands that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between third party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi's vision is to directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. There are two parts in this Centre\n\n### Pawnshop:\n\nBorrower:\n\nIn this Pawnshop, Pawnfi supports players to use their ERC-20 token (MANA) or NFTs (Wearables/ LAND) as collateral to borrow funds. While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short-term cash flow (without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long!). Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a \"Loan + Sale\" together.\n\nLender:\n\nWhen visiting this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short-term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest income. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.\n\n### Rental Centre\n\nBuilders:\n\nInstead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.\n\nRenters:\n\nGiven that building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only purchase from secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not be able to sell it in the future. With this Rental Centre, renters can try out new wearables for short-term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.\n\nIn conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and building a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world,  Pawnfi wants to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and enlightening builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland Pawnfi can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, Pawnfi also help the players to obtain the gaming experience without jumping back and forth between different platforms.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and is a ready-to-launch platform. Our public testing in coming weeks will support all kinds of DCL assets. However, acquiring funding through DAO would help Pawnfi devote more to development, and hire UI designer/ architecture to build up a native pawnshop/ rental centre in Decentraland. Here is what Pawnfi plan to enhance and improve:\n\n**Pawnfi Platform UI Optimization** To make the whole UI/ UX more accommodating to Decentraland and the overall experience more smooth, we’ll hire UI Designer to help to build a more solid Interface. This is a high priority because when go live we want to onboard DCL players at first place and make the UX more immersive.\n\n**Native Pawnshop and Rental Centre** Pawnfi understands that it is not user-friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between third party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi will directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. We will bring in developer/ architecture. It’s vital to ensure the user experience and audience can be kept in DCL world.\n\n**Build Relationship with Builders** We want to onboard the best creators/ builders to place their new wearables in our Rental Centre. While Pawnfi will normally charge service fee for placing rentals, for DCL creators we will provide rebate, which means contributing our service revenue to DCL community.\n\nFor more details, please refer to product deck: https://drive.google.com/file/d/176naRyblIEVbvJ8NqV5VMbbm65feugAc/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n### Wesley - Chief Executive Officer\n\nCFA Charterholder with more than 5-year experience in investment and banking industry, leading security Lending & Borrowing business. Work on the whole financial logic for collateral loan/ lease/ sale.\n\n### Dirk - Chief Technology Officer\n\nFormer CTO at Yintech (NASDAQ:YIN), with more than 15-year corporate experience in Fintech software development and blockchain.\n\n### Stephen - Front-end engineer\n\nSenior game developer from Tencent Timi Game Studio and 5-year experience in Blockchain development.\n\n### Black - Product Manager\n\n3 years front end development experience at Yintech (NASDAQ:YIN), and 3 years experience as a PM in blockchain contributing more than 5 projects.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis project will be completed within 10 weeks. The roadmap is as follows:\n\n*   Week 1-2: UI/UX optimization of Pawnfi platform\n*   Week 3: Internal testing and final bug fixing\n*   Week 4 -6: Public Testing & Strategic Partners Announcement\n*   Week 7: Platform Mainnet Launch\n*   Week 8-10: Pawnshop and Rental Centre Building design in Decentraland\n*   Week 10: Pawnshop and Rental Centre open in Decentraland\n\nWe will update our latest progress via below channels:\n\n*   Website: https://pawnfi.com/\n*   Twitter: https://twitter.com/pawnfiofficial\n*   Discord: https://discord.com/invite/pawnfi\n*   Medium: https://blog.pawnfi.com/\n*   Telegram: https://t.me/pawnfiprotocol\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a37682b0-7798-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**",

He shared his thoughts on Voting Power and earning a Point Of Interest. He also shared a proposal where there is a directory in places where you can search for a location and see locations categorized. For example we would have a Night Club section, Districts and Plazas, Casinos, Art Galleries etc.. We think this could help the user experience to help those who are confused and don't know where to go & help those who know where they want to go but can't find the coordinates or location on trending places/highlights. He did say it was okay for me to propose this idea.

The aim of this space is to build a communal experience around cinema by encouraging diverse voices to exhibit their films and enabling different audiences to engage with filmmakers, Films & Film History.\n\nThe Cinematheque will host independent films across Art House, Genre Cinema & Diverse Upcoming Voices. The primary driver of the experience will be the curation of the films which is aimed to spark conversation and drive engagement in the metaverse around the cinema.\n\nThe entire grant will be used to acquire land(1 parcel) that we have recognized as a good location to begin our development. Renting land is both difficult and hard\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n20,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xb5E34509cf4004ecB51392398D7C18B1D8a0DB3f\n\n## Description\n\n‘Filmrare’ will be a cultural destination in Decentraland with daily screenings & conversations around Cinema. While the primary focus will be on screening films, there will be sidebar events including Q\\&As, Workshops, and exhibitions of Video Installations. The first edition will focus on South Asian Cinema and feature films by leading filmmakers from the region.\n\nThe pandemic has disrupted and affected entertainment but more particularly so the independent filmmakers. The chances of attending film festivals and markets are becoming slimmer each day. We believe that a dedicated space in DCL could spawn a new age of community experience that has made watching cinema one of the best forms of art. As a permanent space in DCL, this place would host events, screenings, and conversations for filmmakers to connect with audiences, buyers, and investors.\n\nWe also intend to acquire rights from other cult classics and screen them as and when Metaverse Movies become more common. We have made some inroads with the rights owners of American Horror Classics & the Iron Dragon movies.\n\nThe intention is to have a 24x7 cinema hall where we publish a month-long program guide and users can walk into any show from any timezone. There will be filler events like standups & live music. Some of them would be ticketed events and most of them would be free to walk in.\n\nVideo streaming on Web3 is still not up to the mark with that of Web2. To solve this we are going to be working very closely with Protocol Labs(Filecoin) on media storage and HD delivery. We also would be developing a platform where it becomes possible to schedule screenings and tie them with ERC-1155 tokens that can be purchased to get access.\n\nOur previous grant request was well-received(20 Yes to 2 Nos) but failed to cross the minimum threshold. We are resubmitting it with the recent DAO changes and hope to get approved.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe cinematheque has been built on a single parcel as a two-storey building that houses a gallery on the ground floor and a theater in the first. A demo can be seen here -> https://youtu.be/AtczYVUIoLU\n\nThe building is being built using Blender 3D models and the DCL SDK. We also have a screening site https://filmrare.com where we have used ERC-1155 tokens to provide access to content. We intend to use the same technology here for ticketed events where the token holders would be allowed to watch screenings.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe team consists of the below three members who bring engineering, creativity, and industry experience.\n\nRavi Krishnan, Founder of Filmrare ->https://www.linkedin.com/in/krcnow/\n\nMathivanan Rajendran, Program Director at Root.ax -> https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathivananr/\n\nArun Karthick BAFTA Breakthrough director -> https://www.bafta.org/supporting-talent/breakthrough/arun-karthick-directorwriter\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe roadmap for the project is as below\n\nJanuary - Parcel acquisition and scene deployment. Testing with BETA users for the multiplayer experience, live streaming, and ERC-1155 based ticketing.\n\nFebruary - Public domain movie screenings by creating events in DCL. Pitching to filmmakers and lining up the editorial. Pitching to film festivals. Early testing of screening plus socializing.\n\nMarch - Key date set for the one month of Cinematheque screenings is Mar 15 - April 20, 2022. The headlining screening will be the screening of films by Arun Karthick (BAFTA Breakthrough India Honouree) (Nasir (2020) | NETPAC winner, International Film Festival of Rotterdam). This would be accompanied by other films.\n\nApril-June - Conducting events at scale with month-long programming.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5ab622d0-7606-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**",

    "body": "> by 0xe435bcd04696dfb7b6da2d6599caee29c9143cb2 (Nebby#3cb2)\n\nI think it's safe to say we all like events. They bring a bit of pizazz to DCL and make the world feel that much more alive. But all too often, events are completely neglected by their hosts -- people stay up late and gather around spaces, only to find that nothing is actually happening on the land. There are also many events that occupy top real estate on the events page for *weeks*, but the event has actually concluded ages ago.\n\nThis is very frustrating and while DCL veterans may tolerate it to an extent, I feel this is extremely detrimental to the growth of the user base. I've brought new people into DCL before for events, and because the event doesn't happen (either it's delayed or completely forgotten about), the new players get frustrated and never touch DCL again.\n\nI suspect some event hosts use the valuable real estate on the events page to market their products/services and don't actually intend on delivering the activities they promise. Who really knows - it's all conjecture. Nonetheless, I think users should have a way of upvoting or downvoting events so that hosts are held responsible for delivering quality experiences.\n\nTL;DR: Implement upvoting/downvoting system for events.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c8bd2af0-7604-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**",

    "body": "> by 0x4d7df6d3d227884678b7787c0585ac2f7e519245 (rokusho#9245)\n\n**Summary**\n\nDefine the price to upload Third Party Wearables and related commissions for the Curators Committee.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThird Party Wearables is a new feature in which Third Parties -meaning other communities/companies/groups that already have their collections of NFTs in circulation- generate a 3D representation of their NFTs in Decentraland as wearables. More details and specifications in the original [DAO Proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) for Third Party Wearables.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nDefine a *fair* *slot* price (each Wearable needs one slot) for Third Parties to upload item representations of their NFTs and a *fair* *commission* *fee* for the Curators that will make sure these representations comply with Decentraland UI guidelines and aesthetics.\n\n**Specification**\n\nAfter the Third Party is added to the Third Party Registry as defined in the previous [DAO Proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240), the Third Party Managers need to go to the [Builder](https://builder.decentraland.org/) and buy one *slot* for each NFT they want their community to have inside Decentraland.\n\nLet use an example: [CCC](https://cryptocannabisclub.com/) (or any other NFT Collection) may want their NFT owners to have a cool stoner hat that is only available for them, a wearable that represents their community and culture. So representatives from CCC could request the DAO to add them as an accepted Third Party to the Third Party Registry. This is the first step, then the Managers need to go to the [Builder](https://builder.decentraland.org/) and start the process.\n\nThe CCC Managers can add 3D models that will represent the stoner hat wearable, but in order to do so, they need to buy one slot for each model. If they only want to give their NFT Owners one single hat for each of them, then they need to buy just one slot. If they want to create a collection of many different models, they need to buy one slot for each one.\n\n**MANA collected from the slots purchases will got to DAO's Treasury and be used for:**\n\n*   Curation fees for the Curators Committee\n*   Cover storage costs for the 3D models\n\n**There are a few things to consider before setting the slots price and commissions:**\n\n*   Price will be paid in MANA, but it will be pegged to the US Dollar.\n*   Collections that were designed in a procedural way (this means that each 3D representation is created by using an algorithm like Bored Apes, Cannabis Club, etc) are not going to be curated individually. For example: if the collection has 10k [Bored Apes](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/), and they were created in a procedural way, curators will only review a portion of the Collection and review the process used to create it.

I am so happy to witness the growth! At the same time, there is a lot of work for Decentraland to do still to support our future.  If there was a referral incentive program i believe we could make a lot of progress by incentivizing others to promote, invite and recruit for Decentraland in which they will be rewarded in MANA for. Maybe a Networking Marketing Agency can be built and put in place with tiers (Rank from experience and seniority) and business model that goes in depth on how we can reward those who invite and recruit for Decentraland. Please start a discussion if this confuses anyone. I would like to Shout out Frank Morrison for thinking of this idea and sharing it with me.

    "body": "> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)\n\n*This is a Pre-Proposal Poll to gauge community sentiments and determine if there is enough support to move forward with a detailed Draft Proposal. Should this proposal receive 500K in VP, it will be resubmitted as a Draft Proposal.*\n\n**Question:** Should Decentraland DAO participate in the Olympus Pro program? Through Olympus Pro, Decentraland can diversify the treasury, accrue liquidity for key liquidity pairs, and create new revenue streams for the DAO.\n\n**Abstract:** Olympus Pro is a bonding service which allows partner protocols to acquire liquidity on token pairs (e.g. MANA-ETH) while offering users discounted tokens in return. Olympus Pro has helped over 24 protocols amass over 16M worth of liquidity. One of the primary benefits of the Olympus Pro program is that it can create a new revenue stream for the DAO, by owning MANA-ETH liquidity and starting  to capture the trading fees. At the time when this proposal was written, the 24 hour volume on the MANA-ETH pair was $4 million dollars, the DAO sees none of those fees.\n\nOlympus Pro is the partnership program of Olympus DAO. More information on Olympus DAO and the Olympus Pro program can be found at the following links:\n\nhttps://olympusdao.medium.com/a-beginners-guide-to-navigating-olympus-pro-5b1a9b710075\n\nhttps://pro.olympusdao.finance/#/bond\n\n- For: Promote poll to create a partnership with Olympus Pro to Draft Proposal Stage \n- Against: Do not promote poll to create a partnership with Olympus Pro to Draft Proposal stage \n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a6d5d950-72c1-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**",

    "body": "> by 0x92e4f1731f2ef18856ed6592fcc0bf55f37c2e1f\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nPawnfi is a Non-Standard Asset platform that supports all the user to put their ERC-20 tokens or NFTs (721/1155) in work. That is, we enable NFT/ GameFi/ Metaverse players to create Pawn (collateral loan), Lease (rent), and Sale purposefully or simultaneously within one transaction.\n\nBy supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place, we will provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and educate builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than just \"buy and sell\" - in Decentraland we can do bigger than that.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x6A44e6C59e2Fa54962e67a70Dd0A34FdC117Be85\n\n## Description\n\nCurrently, the pain point of Asset inventory is that other than buy/ build and sell, there is no other way for NFT holders or  Metaverse players to create liquidity and cash flow.\n\nFor this reason, mirroring the practice in real world that how we treat with many of our assets (Real estate for example), Pawnfi support users to make fully use of their ERC-20/ NFTs: Not only can use it to apply for collateral loan, but you can at the same time rent out to others, and/ or place it for sale. That is, liquidity will be unleashed in different dimensions.\n\nHowever, Pawnfi understand that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between thrid party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi's vision is to directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. There are two parts in this Centre\n\n### Pawnshop:\n\nBorrower:\n\nIn this Pawnshop, we support players to use their ERC-20 token (MANA) or NFTs (Wearables/ LAND) as collateral to borrow funds. While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short term cash flow without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long. Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a Loan + Sale\n\nLender:\n\nWhen visit this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest revenue. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.\n\n### Rental Centre\n\nBuilders\n\nInstead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.\n\nRenters:\n\nGiven building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only buy in secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not able to sell it in future. With this Rental Centre, players can try out new wearables for short term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.\n\nIn conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and build a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world we want to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and educate builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland we can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, obtain the gaming experience without asking players to jump back and forth between different platforms.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and we are a ready to launch platform. Our public testing in coming weeks will alr support all kinds of DCL assets. However, acquiring funding through DAO would help us devote more to development, and hire UI designer/ architecture to build up a native pawnshop/ rental centre in Decentraland. Here is what we plan to enhance and improve:\n\n**Pawnfi Platform UI Optimization** To make the whole UI/ UX more accommodating to Decentraland and the overall experience more smooth, we’ll hire UI Designer to help us build a more solid Interface. This is a high priority because when go live we want to onboard DCL players at first place when go live and make the UX more immersive.\n\n**Native Pawnshop and Rental Centre** Pawnfi understand that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between thrid party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi will directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. We will bring in developer/ architecture. It’s vital to ensure the user experience and audience can be kept in DCL world.\n\n**Build Relationship with Builders** We want to onboard the best creators/ builders to place their new wearables in our Rental Centre. While Pawnfi will normally charge service fee for placing rentals, for DCL creators we will provide rebate, which means contributing our service revenue to DCL community.\n\nFor more details, please refer to product deck:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/176naRyblIEVbvJ8NqV5VMbbm65feugAc/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n### Wesley - Chief Executive Officer\n\nCFA Charterholder with more than 5 years experience in investment industry, specializing in security Lending & Borrowing business. Work on the whole financial logic for collateral loan/ lease/ sale.\n\n### Dirk - Chief Technology Officer\n\nFormer CTO at Yintech (NASDAQ:YIN), with more than 15 years corporate experience in Fintech software development and blockchain.\n\n### Stephen - Front-end engineer\n\nSenior game developer from Tencent Timi Game Studio and 5-year experience in Blockchain development.\n\n### Black - Product Manager\n\n3 years front end development experience at Yintech (NASDAQ:YIN), and 3 years experience as a PM in blockchain contributing more than 5 projects.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis project will be completed within 2 months (8 weeks). The roadmap is as follows:\n\n*   Week 1-2:  UI/UX optimization of Pawnfi platform\n\n*   Week 3: Internal testing and final bug fixing\n\n*   Week 4 -5: Public Testing & Strategic Partners Announcement\n\n*   Week 6: Platform Mainnet Launch\n\n*   Week 6-7: Pawnshop and Rental Centre Building design in Decentraland\n\n*   Week 8: Pawnshop and Rental Centre open in Decentraland\n\nWe will share our latest progress via below channels\n\n*   Website: https://pawnfi.com/\n*   Twitter: https://twitter.com/pawnfiofficial\n*   Discord: https://discord.com/invite/pawnfi\n*   Medium: https://blog.pawnfi.com/\n*   Telegram: https://t.me/pawnfiprotocol\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5ecb5050-71fd-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**",

    "body": "> by 0x9df74fd9d730a8e6319039e7035ef414c3e89524\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe have decided to move towards the development of the project in the metaverse. \"*Ready Player One*\" describes the near future in the basic version.\n\nWe want to make the most convenient exchanger for customers so that they exchange their crypto assets and fiat without leaving the virtual universe, while the movement of funds took place in the real world.\n\nThen we will open the virtual bank, where people will be able to store their coins and get a percentage.\n\nWe will make loans in the form of a vote - the participants will choose the conditions that suit them, but such that they **don't lose everything**.\n\nInterest on deposits will be paid by making a profit from exchanges.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x9df74fd9d730A8e6319039e7035Ef414c3E89524\n\n## Description\n\n### Main project\n\nThe project is at an early stage of development, as only 3 people are working on it. Despite this, we managed to write our own program for the cryptocurrency exchanger, which stands out with speed and security.\n\nThe cryptocurrency exchanger is a central part of the entire ecosphere. We designed program so that it would be as easy to connect other services (for example, integrate the exchanger into the marketplace).\n\n### Other projects in system\n\n**Processing** - The user remains on the site, he doesn't need to go to external systems. This will speed up the payment processing from our side.\n\n**Acquiring**  - Our own acquiring will allow us to reduce commissions for our clients. Besides, acquiring integrated into the system also allows sellers and buyers to receive additional benefits on our platform, for example, cashback.\n\n**Decentralized marketplace**  - In our marketplace, it will be possible to buy goods for both fiat and various cryptocurrencies. This will eliminate one regulator and reduce fees. We will be able to minimize costs and organize healthy competition in product markets with a large number of small participants. At the same time, neither sellers nor buyers will pay commissions, which will reduce the cost of goods.\n\n**NFT service** - NFT service with auction and stock exchange for art freelancers with all functions for accepting, distributing accounting and storing funds. The benefits for sellers and buyers are the same as in the marketplace - the services are interconnected and there are no commissions.\n\nOne of our team members is a certified economist with experience in large banks, so the economic model of our cryptocurrency exchanger is working and already brings some profit.\nFor other services, the economic model is also already being worked out.\n\nBut having a small team imposes its own limitations. We can't work on both the backend and the frontend at the same time. Therefore, the design and functionality in some moments lags behind the competitors.\n\n### So, we need funds for\n\n*   **Programmers** - to work in parallel on several modules;\n\n*   **Web designer** - to improve the usability of all services;\n\n*   **Lawyer** - to resolve disputes and protect us and our partners;\n\n*   **Marketing and sales department** - to promote services.\n\n### Links:\n\n1.  [Our exhanger](https://cryptonex.top/)\n2.  [Running Pre-ICO](https://foundico.com/ico/crypto-online-exchange.html)\n3.  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ICO_Cryptonex)\n4.  [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/COFEOX/comments/rmpvrx/cofpreico_cofeox_cryptocurrency_exchanger/)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe main functions of the exchanger will be implemented in Decentraland. Our team will work to convert a simple exchange on the website into a currency exchange in a bank. At the same time, the user's avatar will be able to make exchanges both in the common space and in a private room - an analogue of a personal account on the site during registration. In addition to notification of a successful exchange, the avatar will be issued checks in Decentraland.\n\nWe want to visualize the exchange itself, as it can happen in reality with a virtual cashier. It will ensure maximum realism.\nAfter that, the visual space of the bank will be created with cashiers, operators, etc. That is, the user will get the full feeling of being in the bank. Virtual contracts will also be created.\n\nThe exchange itself will be carried out through an exchange office, where neuroblockchain technology is being developed, taking into account the possibility of hidden transfers, transfers without confirmation, transfers with confirmation and multitracts. The ability to program tasks, create and track digital contracts and contracts, the ability to store data.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n1.  Dmitriy - **Programmer**\n2.  Anton - **Economist**\n3.

For instance, I own a piece that I am looking to sell for 12,000 mana. I have made an agreement to sell it for 1,000 mana per month for 12 months. During the 12 months, as long as payments have been made, the buyer can be the operator of the land and once the final payment is made they receive the transfer. If they miss a payment or two (subjective), the land stays with me. This is already done in the real world and I think it will open up land purchases to people who dont have all the capital up front while also incentivizing investors like my self. Has anyone seen this or have any guidance on creating it?\n\n- Good Idea\n- Bad Idea\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=422f1690-6f03-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**",

This way buyers could easily shop for items over time.  This would function like a wish list so when a buyer returns to the marketplace they can easily locate those items they have been \"thinking\" about buying and are now ready to complete the purchase.  I'm not sure of any way to currently do this.\n\nMultiple customizable lists would be great for shopping organization.\n\nIt would also be helpful to be able to make your wish lists available for others to see if you desire (gift registries) for birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, donations, etc.  I would settle for having the lists private, but I would like the option to make them public somehow.\n\nIt would also be nice to be able to bundle multiple items into a single purchase (shopping cart), but I'm not sure if that is possible.

While there is currently a variety of natural skin tones and hair styles, the eyes, nose and mouth options are limited to lided, narrow and thin options.\n\nRepresentation matters. For someone to begin imagining a new world they first need to see themselves in it. \"You could see black people on television, but you never saw black people in the future until Gene Roddenberry put a beautiful black woman on that show.

That's why Goldberg wanted to be part of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation.\" ~ from CNet Article\n\nThere is a free market solution to this.

    "body": "> by 0xb5e34509cf4004ecb51392398d7c18b1d8a0db3f (Ravi#db3f)\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\n‘Filmrare’ is a Travelling Cinematheque that can host Film Screenings, Archive films & film-related artifacts. The aim of this space is to build a communal experience around cinema by encouraging diverse voices to exhibit their films and enabling different audiences to engage with filmmakers, Films & Film History.\n\nThe Cinematheque will host independent films across Art House, Genre Cinema & Diverse Upcoming Voices.  The primary driver of the experience will be the curation of the films which is aimed to spark conversation and drive engagement in the metaverse around the cinema.\n\nThe Grant will be used to rent land & pay screening fees to the filmmakers.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xb5E34509cf4004ecB51392398D7C18B1D8a0DB3f\n\n## Description\n\n‘Filmrare’ will be a cultural destination in Decentraland with daily screenings & conversations around Cinema. While the primary focus will be on screening films, there will be sidebar events including Q\\&As, Workshops, and exhibitions of Video Installations.\nThe first edition will focus on South Asian Cinema and feature films by leading filmmakers from the region.\n\nThe pandemic has disrupted and affected entertainment but more particularly so the independent filmmakers. The chances of attending film festivals and markets are becoming slimmer each day.  We believe that a dedicated space in DCL could spawn a new age of community experience that has made watching cinema one of the best forms of art. As a permanent space in DCL, this place would host events, screenings, and conversations for filmmakers to connect with audiences, buyers, and investors.\n\nThe grant money will be used to rent a parcel for 6 months. We intend to rent a 100 MANA parcel with a deposit of 200 MANA. The remaining amount of close to $2000 will be used to incentivize filmmakers for giving us the rights to screen their films.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe cinematheque has been built on a single parcel as a two-storey building that houses a gallery on the ground floor and a theater in the first. A demo can be seen here -> https://youtu.be/AtczYVUIoLU\n\nThe building is being built using Blender 3D models and the DCL SDK. We also have a screening site https://filmrare.com where we have used ERC-1155 tokens to provide access to content. We intend to use the same technology here for ticketed events where the token holders would be allowed to watch screenings.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe team consists of the below three members who bring engineering, creativity, and industry experience.\n\nRavi Krishnan, Founder of Filmrare ->https://www.linkedin.com/in/krcnow/\n\nMathivanan Rajendran, Program Director at Root.ax -> https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathivananr/\n\nArun Karthick BAFTA Breakthrough director -> https://www.bafta.org/supporting-talent/breakthrough/arun-karthick-directorwriter\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe roadmap for the project is as below\n\nJanuary - Parcel acquisition and scene deployment. Testing with BETA users for the multiplayer experience, live streaming, and ERC-1155 based ticketing.\n\nFebruary - Public domain movie screenings by creating events in DCL. Pitching to filmmakers and lining up the editorial. Pitching to film festivals. Early testing of screening plus socializing.\n\nMarch - Key date set for the one month of Cinematheque screenings is Mar 15 - April 20, 2022. The headlining screening will be the screening of films by Arun Karthick (BAFTA Breakthrough India Honouree) (Nasir (2020) | NETPAC winner, International Film Festival of Rotterdam).  This would be accompanied by other films.\n\nApril-June - Conducting events at scale with month-long programming.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=427458f0-6cbe-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**",

Our goal is to provide a cool and professional experience to these brands every time, with the best we can provide as a platform, and the engagement we can generate with the right resources.\n\nSo facing the challenge of a bigger amount of artists and brands wanting to be in the district, we want to generate memorable assets and also make the museum platform better for brands and be able to execute a bigger scope.\n\nWe need resources for platform scaling, new premium artist activations and new artistic projects.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nNew Artists : Event Production, design + sdk work, Artist wearables, etc\n\nScaling (front end) : Explore scaling solutions based on location, scene or others\n\nScaling (back end) : More Admin tools and features, we are currently using VueJS\n\nBiz Dev Support : Support on selecting and creating key business relationships\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nNicolas Ruggieri (design, dev)\nMarcelo Quinzio (3D)\nDamian Trimboli (dev)\nCarlos Ripetta (design)\nLucas Palomeque (meme advisor)\nLara Fahler (community mgmt.)\n\nPotential Hires:\nCloe Sierchuk (sdk)\nRound 14 - Damian Caruso (Dev Studio)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nQ1 2022\n\nBiz Dev\\\nWe aim to close our first investment round during Q1. To do so we are starting our full time biz dev operation during jan and aiming to close between 2 to 3 MM.\n\nCommunity\nReach 2K followers within our twitter and instagram accounts to start showing more presence in the social media.\n\nEvents\n\nWe have events confirmed for January and February.  Part of the Biz dev efforts would be to set up the agenda for March and April in advance.\n\nDevelopment\nAdd new features for our front and back end.\n\nHappy to communicate our progress on monthly basis. We want to have all the scaling solutions explored in the first quarter, and make an upgrade to our backend features that is connected to the scaling solutions we use as well. Among other features in the works.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=92da0ce0-68d1-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**",

    "body": "> by 0x1253594843798ff0fcd7fa221b820c2d3ca58fd5 (anniestarduster)\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nIRLArt is a collective of artists and art directors focused on high impact creative projects. We recreate all of our physical exhibits in the metaverse. We have built in Cryptovoxels, Somnium Space, VRChat, Mona.Gallery, scanned our spaces with Matterport, and are committed to bridging digital to physical. We have a physical gallery and venue, IRL Underground, based in Denver, CO we host DAO supported NFT exhibits in. Since 2019 we have also been the art stewards of ETHDenver, managing the Art Gallery and Auction build and curation.\n\nYou can find us at: https://twitter.com/irlart\\_\\_ | https://instagram.com/irlart\\_\\_ | https://irlunderground.com | https://linktr.ee/irlvirtual\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x1253594843798Ff0fcd7Fa221B820C2d3cA58FD5\n\n## Description\n\nPlease view our full proposal doc here: https://bit.ly/3zaEi2v\n\nOver the next 6 months, Decentraland will be the primary metaverse we focus on and build in for ETHDenver, EFDevconnect, Sonic Bloom, and other high impact opportunities. Our goal in decentraland is to recreate the main conference building, the Sports Castle, at ETHDenver 2022, highlight, and showcase 100 + featured artists at the official ETHDenver Art Gallery and Auction. Artists can choose a commission from 0 - 100%, with their designated commission going to a beneficiary. This year the commission will go to Gitcoin; to benefit Art focused Public Goods.\n\nOur two calls for artists can be found here:\nirlunderground.com/eth-denver-gallery\nirlunderground.com/gitcoin\n\nThis year's panel of curators of the gallery have diverse backgrounds, spanning multiple creative initiatives around art and technology. Annie Phillips, of IRL Art, Robert Gray of IRL Art, Shivani Mitra of Museum of Crypto Art, and Jessica Angel of Art Project Decentralized.\n\nWe will work with our collaborators in the NEAR Ecosytem, who created our video last year, to have a video made of the gallery to post on social media.\n\nLast years video: https://www.instagram.com/p/CK7B-w4n4Gb/\n\nWe will share the video directly with all of the approximately 100 participating artists and facilitators to promote decentraland, the auction, the artists, and ETHDenver.\n\nAdditionally, we will livestream builds, interview participating builders, and share those through DCL Reports and Boombox Heads twitch streams. Our inhouse video team will additionally make periodic recaps of our progress and builds.\n\nIn the ETHDenver gallery, we will have decentraland vinyl and printed graphics on a display around a large TV that will host the video with a QR code to visit the parcels. We will provide (2) VR headsets to conference attendees to experience the gallery physically and virtually within Decentraland. The conference will have over 5000 attendees physically, and thousands more can tune in virtually through GamerJibe and our potential Decentraland Gallery.\n\nWe currently don't own any parcels of land in any metaverse. This would be our first ability to integrate and explore more features, like adding contributors, and creating wearables, which is only accessible to land owners. It will allow us more long term ability to add new contributors, provide educational, hands-on opportunities for more creators in our collective to learn and engage with Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe will complete this project internally with the 7 team members, our larger network of collaborators and partners, and the additional 8 granted collaborators.\n\nPlease view our previous projects here:\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/irlvirtual\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/fractilians\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/boomboxheads\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nAnnie Stardust -\n\n*   Founder of IRL Art, Digital Artist and Art Director working primarily in Cinema 4D, with a background in animation, content development, 3D world building, early NFT artist, onboarded over 400 artists into NFTs, and art steward for ETHDenver since 2019.\n\nYultek - Multimedia Artist, Graphic Designer, Metaverse Architect, AR/VR content producer - Lead designer and installer for IRLart - @yultek\\_\n\nGodfrey - Virtual Reality Developer, Crypto Artist working in 3d / VR, Virtual Production, Virtual Art Galleries, VR Music Videos, Music Producer, Real-TIme Production and Streaming\n\nFractilians - Digital + Analog  Visual Arts Educator + Content Creation. 3D/VR , Streaming, Video production.

    "title": "Should decentraland marketplace have an option for leasing names ?",
    "body": "> by 0xbc02db030361121dd43bbb2fcbcb4f9f98c1dc7d (BobRoss)\n\nMany feel left out on owning their desired names in DCL.  This is due to early adopters scooping up most of these premium/platinum names during the official launch in 2020. Lately I am noticing almost all new users with guest names. There are a couple of reasons for this. One is affordability due to requiring 100 Mana + Gas to claim a name. Another reason is most likely because the name they want has already been claimed by another user. Perhaps the last reason is name price on the secondary market is well above their threshold.\n\nHere is why I believe there should be a marketplace for leasing DCL Names:\n\n*   Allow new users to experience what it feels like owning a name at 1/10th or 1/100th of the actual minting price.\n\n*   Give someone the pleasure of having their dream name inside the metaverse.\n\n*   Provide awareness, liquidity,  volume & activity in names market.\n\n*   Incentive and passive income for anyone who owns two names or more.\n\n*   Possibility for leasing names in L2 Polygon (Matic) with almost no fees. (technically may or may not be possible)\n\n*   Great model for pop-up, one time events where that name is required or relevant for that event.\n\nLeasing options can be 1 day, 1 week, 1 month etc.. I longer the term of the lease cheaper it becomes.\n\nBy\n\nJasonX\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=54d96060-6766-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**",

    "body": "> by 0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc (Yemel#60bc)\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nBeatBlox is a platform that seeks to connect artists with their audiences through virtuality. It is firmly grounded on blockchain technology as a vehicle to explore new dynamics of interaction and commercialization. It was born out of the fusion of entrepreneurs from different profiles and backgrounds, collected by their passion for arts and technology and the determination to achieve a fairer and more direct bond between creators and their respective communities.\n\nTeaser video:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1gB2WgDw3z-oBEO0ZbpdxXGm4HSrI8Viz/view?usp=sharing\n\nPlease refer to our presentation:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x9405cF5BDe70bB78c0dDF1425AEd6A2f110fC733\n\n## Description\n\nAs a community, we are entering an exploration phase to review different adoption cases for this new consumption and communication tendencies. In this context, the opportunity arises to adjust the balance towards certain segments that, due to lack of proper channels, have been exploited for the last few decades. We seek to promote an ethical and conscious evolution of virtualization and decentralization.\n\nThe commercialization scheme linked to musical NFTs is in a speculative stage. The real value that it offers for users turns out to be quite confusing once we dig deeper and try to go beyond the resale possibilities and the warranty that the image associated with them provides.\n\nWe aim to develop an ecosystem that provides the stimulus of a scalable and sustainable bond between creators and audiences through their interaction in Decentraland. The social element will be the engine that powers our marketplace, where exclusive content and presentations of our curated catalog of creators will provide added value to the participants. Also, each user will be able to manage a crate or personalized library that will allow him or her to showcase their assets in the platform as well as in our virtual district, promoting a sense of owning a unique collection, user interaction and direct financing from communities to creators.\n\nOur multidisciplinary team is composed by professionals that specialize in all key areas of the productive chain: from musicians to engineers, producers, creatives, developers and a vast array of resources and capacities joined together by the passion of linking music with technology, as well as the desire to contribute to the development of interactions and flow of energy in the shape of information that Decentraland and the whole crypto ecosystem provides.\n\nPlease refer to our documentation for further description: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Specification\n\nBeatBlox Muisc District:\n\nOur primary goal is to keep developing the possibilities offered by the Metaverse, with our district in Decentraland being the main focus of the BeatBlox expansion. We seek to develop an ecosystem that allows artists to create additional revenue and distribution channels, while enabling a more deep connection with their audiences. There, users will be able to engage in expanded experiences such as virtual concerts, events, NFT auctions, gamified content and educational resources that will contribute to reduce the margin of adoption.\n\nBeatBlox Music District stays loyal to the principle of content care in regards to aesthetics and overall quality of the artwork. This is at the core of every idea developed, from the stores to the interactive installations and NFT associated services. We are creating strategic alliances with music and blockchain fields referents for the development of user focused experiences and content. By doing this, we aim to further promote and encourage the adoption and use of Decentraland.\n\nCome and visit us at 40,44.\n\nBeatBlox Marketplace and Academy:\n\nBy using Polygon and reducing minting costs significally, we have succesfully implemented a NFTs sales and distribution system that allows floor prices as low as USD 1. We also gave birth to a concept in its entirety for our Decentraland district.\n\nIn this opportunity, we are reaching out to the community for helping us to strength the development, the promotion and the scalability of an integral platform. This will add value to users in the metaverse, while helping to reduce adoption barriers for new participants\n\nThis platform will be leveraged by a marketplace with expanded social functionalities, a curated catalog to ensure high quality standards and an Academy to support the adoption of new technologies linked to a further democratized access for artists and users to the vast opportunities that this technology provides.\n\nPlease refer to our documentation for further description: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nPlease refer to our documentation for a full description of our team, experience and background: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nPlease refer to our documentation for a full description of monthly goals, short to long term vision and budget breakdown: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=903b6e60-6409-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**",

With a upgraded PC I would acquire land and create avatar with a name. My family and I would like to contribute as much as possible. Daily gamer of 25 years.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n2,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2d4ba5F549c78c2e34aa8e1A3894c75e3d5F9150\n\n## Description\n\nDreamers dream and builders build. I am both! I have been a everyday gamer since I was 14 years old. Now 39, I have 3 wonderful kids (2,9,&12) that are gamers with the little one catching up fast to be a future gamer. Due to my old Laptop (2017) Been having major issues playing Decentraland, as far as I got was jumping into the portal after the tutorial. I don't have a strong enough graphics in my laptop to play. This grant would enable me and my kids to purchase a Gamer PC. I have always used PS, Wii, oculus...etc., in the past with no need for a gaming PC. Not being able to afford a Gaming PC means not playing Decentraland and not being able to contribute. I would contribute in every way possible. I have $100 usd in Mana stored in my coinbase account waiting for my family and I to play. I have contributed in ever venture that stands beside me to the max. Unfortunately without this grant might it be years before we will experience the future of gaming Decentraland. Thank you for your time.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nI will use 100% of funds in buying a computer to run and contribute in decentraland. First i would buy  Alienware Aurora R10 Ryzen 1400-1700. Any funds left will buy accessories like mouse keyboard and screen. In the past I have built PCs for friends, apon thinking more I believe the smartest idea is to buy it already built. As soon as I have the PC I will run decentraland and contribute any and everyway possible.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nMyself Allen, my daughter Azalea with my son Jacob. I have been working on NFTs on https://crypto.com/nft/profile/atheistalien. Everyday player of Call of Duty, and F1 2021 and so many others.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nPurchase Gamer Pc, purchase accessories. Log into my decentraland account and create name/avatar purchase land and build. Contribute every cent of whatever money I receive left i will put back in Decentraland and Mana\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5eb0e350-637f-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**",

    "body": "> by 0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc (Yemel#60bc)\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\n(This proposal has been resubmitted using the new VP thresholds and voting period. Originally posted by Joe)\n\n**WonderMine is a social play-to-earn game** where you mine meteors, collect resources and craft upgrades and rewards in the form of wearables and other NFTs. WonderMine is often the most popular location in Decentraland, with over 10,000 daily users in recent days.\n\nWe want to improve WonderMine and the other games in the WonderZone Amusement Park, making WonderZone and Decentraland the go-to places for play-to-earn metaverse games.\n\nLink to WonderMine: https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-28%2C56\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xfcacAcE2713D41c02666E2643E5583793196c935\n\n## Description\n\nWhen creating WonderMine, our initial goal was to give players a fun reason to log in to Decentraland every day. We started with simple game mechanics, resources, and crafting rules so people can immediately start playing without a steep learning curve. We also wanted it to be a social hub for Decentraland players.\n\nWe are proud of what we have built so far, and the great player community that has formed around the game. But improving the game has taken longer than we wanted. We owe it to the players to add game play features and offer more craftable wearables and NFTs. As a part-time team we haven’t had the time or funding to fully dedicate ourselves to WonderZone.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAcquiring funding through the DAO would let us dedicate more time to development, and hire an additional developer to help us improve WonderMine and other games in WonderZone park. Here is what we plan on expanding and improving:\n\n**Server improvements** To make the crafting experience and the overall gameplay experience more smooth, we’ll bring on a server-side developer to help us build a more solid server infrastructure. This is a high priority because we’ve had server performance issues during previous events, with a sudden influx of new players. It’s vital to ensure scalability as our games become popular.\n\n**WonderZone NFTs** Many of our players have been waiting anxiously for WonderZone NFTs, Diamond tipped Pickaxe, WonderGem Pickaxe and NFT fishing poles eventually. We will fast track the development of our proprietary NFTs once we acquire the necessary funding.\n\n**Shared meteors and meteor tiers** Currently in WonderMine, players can’t see the meteors that other players are mining. Shared meteors will be an additional class of meteor that can be seen by everyone in the scene. **This will introduce some interesting competition and collaboration into the game.** The shared meteors will be more rare and valuable in general, and require more than one person to mine them. These rare meteors might drop all over the park, so a valuable meteor could drop in a distant place in the park, and you will have to gather people from the mining field to help you mine it, and you will all share the rewards!\n\n**Kingfisher social fishing game** Some of you know that we already ran 2 beta tests of our newest game “Kingfisher”, which is a social fishing game. Kingfisher will be integrated into the WonderZone crafting economy. The materials you fish will be used in combination with WonderMine materials to craft wearables in the future. Some of the funding will go towards bug fixing and improving it so we can finally release it in 2022!\n\nKingfisher playthrough by Peanutbutta: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj436P3ohCU\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**The team**\n\n*   **Rob Dixon (Radix)**, Co-founder, lead developer\n*   **Chestnutbruze**, Co-founder, 3D artist\n*   **Lew Co-founder**, 3D artist\n*   **maruudn**, Community manager\n*   **Maricela Perdomo (Maricela)**, 3D artist\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**2022 Q1**\n\n*   Server improvements\n*   WonderZone NFTs\n*   Shared meteors\n*   New wearables\n*   Aesthetic improvement of in-game assets\n*   In-game highscore leaderboards with monthly rewards/tournaments\n\n**2022 Q2**\n\n*   Release Kingfisher, a new social fishing game\n*   More meteor tiers, rarer meteors with more valuable materials\n*   Wearables Shop and Ticket System\n*   In-game Pets\n*   More wearables\n*   Expand WonderMine to other scenes across Decentraland\n*   Restructuring of the park\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=6557be60-5f59-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**",

Costs associated with this set up are included in the Grant.\n\nThe grant will be provided as a vesting contract of stablecoins assigned to a 2-out-of-3 signatures Multisig. Participants are Gino Cingolani, Yemel Jardi and Manuel Araoz in their respective capacity as Squad Lead, DAO Committee Member and Trusted Community Member.\n\n### Conditions of the Grant\n\nThe Grant is conditioned to the satisfaction and fulfillment of each and all of the following:\n\n*   The DAO Governance Squad shall use the funds from the Grant solely for the purpose of developing and maintaining the Governance dApp and tools to support the operations of the DAO, as described in below, in accordance with the guidelines and roadmap detailed below (“Roadmap and Milestones”).\n\n*   The DAO Governance Squad shall set up a Multisig Wallet (the “MultiSig”), for purposes of receiving the Grant, with the signatories indicated above.\n    Disbursements of the Grant shall be conditioned upon achieving the roadmap milestones and presented in the monthly reports within the timeframe set forth below.\n\n*   The DAO Governance Squad will provide the DAO with the following information:\n\n    *   Within five (5) days of the beginning of each month, a Monthly Progress Report regarding the development of the Governance dApp and the achievement of Milestones will be presented to the DAO Committee and DAO Facilitator.\n\n    *   Within ten (10) days of the beginning of each month, Monthly Financial Report showing use of the proceeds of the Grant.\n\n    *   Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of the annual financial statements of the DAO Governance Squad in case there are more extensions of this Grant.\n\n    *   Representatives of the DAO Governance Squad shall meet with representatives of the Decentraland Foundation and/or DAO Committee, acting for the benefit and upon the implicit instruction of the DAO, to provide technical updates and answer legal and financial questions regarding the use of the Grant.\n\n*   The Intellectual Property Rights over the Governance dApp shall be owned by the Decentraland Foundation, acting for the benefit of the LAND and MANA communities. In the event that in the future it is legally feasible for the DAO to hold the Intellectual Property Rights over the Governance dApp, theDAO Governance Squad or the Decentraland Foundation, as applicable, shall execute the relevant documents. For purposes hereof, “Intellectual Property Rights” means (whether or not registered in any jurisdiction) copyrights, trade secrets and patents, all other proprietary rights recognized under applicable law and all applications and registrations as well as the right to file all applications and registrations for, or relating to, all of the foregoing, in connection with the Governance dApp.\n\n*   The Governance dApp must be compliant with the Terms of Use, Content Policy and Privacy Policy of Decentraland, as updated from time to time.\n\n*   Upon failure to comply with any of the conditions of above by the DAO Governance Squead, the vesting contract will be revoked by the DAO, returning unvested funds.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe proposed team of the DAO Governance Squad is the following:\n\n*   Senior Product Manager - Gino Cingolani ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginocingolani) ,  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ginocingolani))\n\n*   Senior Product Designer - Juan Ruiz Echazu ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heyimjuani/) ,  [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/juani) ,  [Github](https://github.com/heyimjuani))\n\n*   Senior Full Stack Developer - Juan Pablo Arnaudo ([Github](https://github.com/jparnaudo) ,  [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jparnaudo/))\n\n*   Semi-senior Front-end Developer - To be defined\n\n*   Semi-senior Technical Copywriter - To be defined\n\nTotal Hours: ~360 monthly hours or ~80 weekly hours.\\`\nBudget: 20.000 USD per month, including payroll and operational expenses.\n\nAs stated above, this will be structured as a non-profit foundation so the DAO Governance Squad will basically cover the cost of providing this service.\n\nThe positions for Semi-senior Front-end Developer and Semi-senior Technical Writer are still open and we are looking for candidates. If you are interested, write to me via Discord or forum DM.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nInitially, the team will focus on the following 3 points:\n\n*   Engagement: Better ways to engage with the governance process.\n*   Transparency: Provide more information and accountability.\n*   Automation: Simplify recurrent tasks, reduce human operation.\n\nThese guidelines can be broken down into actionable steps like:\n\n*   Automate generation of reports.\n*   Ease and automate DAO Committee operations.\n*   Add a Treasury page showing stats of the current treasury.\n*   Add a Grants page showing all grants that have been or are being funded by the DAO.\n*   Add a Members page listing current teams and members.\n*   Load forum comments on the proposal to encourage discussion.\n*   Implement automatic status updates of proposals in the forum.\n*   Work on reports on technical viability about discussed proposals.\n*   Implement content moderation tools for the community, DAO Facilitator, and DAO Committee to help filter out offensive, poorly defined, or spammy proposals.\n*   Improve the proposal creation process by adding new proposal categories for common actions in the DAO.\n*   Advance the grant program to include larger grants with a more robust vetting and oversight process.\n\nThe team will follow agile development practices to ensure the fast implementation of DAO governance requirements and the continuous improvement of such features. The team will host open meetings with members of the DAO to gather feedback, answer questions and provide updates at least every 90 days.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**",

    "body": "> by 0x9a739c2e212754c3d8432cb717dc9437e5b3dfae (Sean#dfae)\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nDecentraland can benefit from an immersive builder and viewer that empowers people to easily build environments and create interactive experiences within a VR and AR headset.\n\nThe developers of Byldr (https://www.byldr.app/) are requesting a grant to enable Byldr to create experiences for Decentraland and for it to be used to experience Decentraland in VR.\n\nByldr is a free, no-code immersive app and scene creation tool that is currently available for the Quest 2 and HoloLens 2 headsets. Having launched in 2020, it currently has over 5000+ downloads and has been used to create VR games and enterprise-grade applications. The Byldr team is excited to bring more VR and AR capabilities to Decentraland for a fully realized Metaverse experience.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n220,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x9A739c2e212754c3d8432CB717dC9437e5b3Dfae\n\n## Description\n\nByldr's creators believe that the future of computing involves the movement away from traditional 2D screens and towards immersive, 3D spatial computing. As of this writing, Decentraland is a 3D metaverse that ironically can only be experienced and built through a flat, 2D screen. Byldr was created for AR and VR applications to be created using AR and VR headsets rather than 2D PCs, thereby getting humanity one step closer to a mixed reality future. Byldr's developers seek to further expand this progress by enabling creators to build experiences for Decentraland using VR and AR headsets. This allows creators to feel the scale of their creations while creating it, and accelerate the speed of creation using Byldr's intuitive hand-tracking interactions and spatial tools. Creators will be able to see or preview their creations in-context within Decentraland using Byldr. This means that Byldr may also be used as a gateway to experience Decentraland using the Quest 2 and the HoloLens 2.\n\nThe Byldr development team is excited to bring our trusted immersive creation experience to Decentraland and would like to thank everyone in the Decentraland community for your support and the integral part you play in building the XR future for all generations to come.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nByldr's development team proposes to integrate with Decentraland in the following ways:\n\n1.  Allow experiences and scenes created using Byldr to be exported to Decentraland.\n    Byldr will be retooled to be able to export creations built using Byldr into Decentraland. After a user has created an interactive or static experience within Byldr, the user will have the option to export that experience to Decentraland, including where the experience will be placed. Users will also be able to edit or update these experiences after being published. Byldr will be updated to tightly integrate with Decentraland with the goal of making Byldr feel like a native extension for building Decentraland experiences.\n\n2.  Allow users to experience Decentraland using VR and AR headsets. Although not the primary goal of this grant, re-tooling Byldr to create experiences for Decentraland will also involve the ability for users to experience Decentraland in AR and VR through Byldr (similar to how users can experience Decentraland through a browser such as Google Chrome on a PC.) It is understood that other parallel efforts are being made to enable VR support for Decentraland, so this project will focus primarily on content creation within AR and VR. That said, if these efforts by Byldr allow VR support for Decentraland to come sooner, it will be a win for the Decentraland community and provide additional means/devices to experience Decentraland (Byldr currently supports the Quest 2 and HoloLens 2 headsets.) We understand that rendering the Decentraland experience on mobile-grade XR devices like the Quest and HoloLens presents it's own set of performance challenges. The Byldr team intends to utilize several XR optimization techniques to allow for Decentraland to be a performant experience on a mobile XR device while minimizing quality loss (compared to running on a PC browser with a dedicated graphics card.) Some of these techniques may involve more aggressive culling of faraway objects, using mobile-optimized shaders, distance-based level-of-detail (LOD) rendering, foveated rendering, and other techniques.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n### The Byldr team comprises:\n\nSean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n\nStephen Clarke (Management)\n\nKetan Kapila (3D modeling/tooling)\n\nDerek Bolton (Management)\n\nVarun Siddaraju (Technical project manager and senior developer)\n\nClint Campbell (XR developer)\n\nPaul Gumpert (XR developer)\n\nCole Astaire (Technical artist)\n\nClinton Reddie (XR developer)\n\nVeeRuby Technologies (Byldr's development partner)\n\nAppVolks LLC (Byldr's development partner)\n\nXR Dev Studio (Byldr's development partner)\n\nCollectively, Byldr's team members have over 100 person-years of XR development experience. Additional information on our company, team members, and partners can be found in the links below:\n\nhttps://www.byldr.app/\n\nhttps://www.xrdevstudio.com/\n\nhttps://www.veeruby.com/\n\nhttps://www.appvolks.com/\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe Byldr team will report progress to the Decentraland community on a weekly basis and will monitor the project's forum closely for questions or to provide updates as needed.\n\nThe proposed project will be completed within 6 months based on the following milestones and timeline:\n\nJanuary-February 2022: Retooling Byldr logic system and 3D model support for Decentraland integration.\n\nMarch-April 2022: Initial, limited export-to-Decentraland functionality. User account integration. Initial ability to view creations in context within Decentraland in AR/VR device.\n\nMay-June 2022: Initial public alpha and beta tests expected. Testing, bug fixes, user feedback collection. Full release of Byldr with Decentraland support.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=088fc210-5e26-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**",

Before they were costing all the transactions.\n\nSince June 1, 2021 (~6 months ago) Decentraland has used 4k MATIC. I'm requesting ~15k MATIC to fund the Gas tank to keep transactions free in Polygon for at least ~1 year having into account that the average gas price can increase. *They have increased from 1 to 30 some months ago*\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n45,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x87956abC4078a0Cc3b89b419928b857B8AF826Ed\n\n## Description\n\nIn the Ethereum world, things happen thanks to transactions. These transactions, just like everything in life, don’t come for free. In order to create and execute a transaction, you need to pay a fee in the form of “Gas” which costs ETH. But what if you want to create a transaction and you don't want to pay for gas. This is where Meta-Transactions come.\n\n**Meta-transactions** are transactions whose data is created and signed off-chain by one person and executed by another person who pays the gas fees.\n\n**Decentraland** has been using meta transactions to provide users the best possible experience through the dApps and the explorer.  For example, creators have been creating **~600 smart contracts (collections)** without knowing that they were doing that and creating and trading **~630k NFTs** without spending any MATIC/ETH. Data from [here](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/decentraland/collections-matic-mainnet?query=Totals)\n\n[Biconomy announcement:](https://bit.ly/3EF7dO4)\n\n> We are super excited to announce the much-awaited product upgrade - Personalised Gas Tanks. In the future, each dApp will have its gas tank to sponsor gasless transactions for the end-user.\n> What are the benefits of the gas tank?\n\n> 1.  You get your very own and private gas tank for your dApp, which ensures that no transaction gets dropped or fails due to insufficient funds.\n\n> 2.

It is firmly grounded on blockchain\ntechnology as a vehicle to explore new dynamics of interaction and\ncommercialization. It was born out of the fusion of entrepreneurs from\ndifferent profiles and backgrounds, collected by their passion for arts\nand technology and the determination to achieve a fairer and more\ndirect bond between creators and their respective communities.\n\nTeaser video:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1gB2WgDw3z-oBEO0ZbpdxXGm4HSrI8Viz/view?usp=sharing\n\nPlease refer to our presentation:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x9405cF5BDe70bB78c0dDF1425AEd6A2f110fC733\n\n## Description\n\nAs a community, we are entering an exploration phase to review\ndifferent adoption cases for this new consumption and communication\ntendencies. In this context, the opportunity arises to adjust the balance\ntowards certain segments that, due to lack of proper channels, have\nbeen exploited for the last few decades. We seek to promote an ethical\nand conscious evolution of virtualization and decentralization.\n\nThe commercialization scheme linked to musical NFTs is in a\nspeculative stage. The real value that it offers for users turns out\nto be quite confusing once we dig deeper and try to go beyond the\nresale possibilities and the warranty that the image associated with\nthem provides.\n\nWe aim to develop an ecosystem that provides the stimulus of a\nscalable and sustainable bond between creators and audiences\nthrough their interaction in Decentraland. The social element will be\nthe engine that powers our marketplace, where exclusive content and\npresentations of our curated catalog of creators will provide added\nvalue to the participants. Also, each user will be able to manage a\ncrate or personalized library that will allow him or her to showcase\ntheir assets in the platform as well as in our virtual district, promoting\na sense of owning a unique collection, user interaction and direct\nfinancing from communities to creators.\n\nOur multidisciplinary team is composed by professionals that specialize\nin all key areas of the productive chain: from musicians to engineers,\nproducers, creatives, developers and a vast array of resources\nand capacities joined together by the passion of linking music with\ntechnology, as well as the desire to contribute to the development\nof interactions and flow of energy in the shape of information that\nDecentraland and the whole crypto ecosystem provides.\n\nPlease refer to our documentation for further description:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Specification\n\nBeatBlox Muisc District:\n\nOur primary goal is to keep developing the possibilities offered by the\nMetaverse, with our district in Decentraland being the main focus\nof the BeatBlox expansion. We seek to develop an ecosystem that\nallows artists to create additional revenue and distribution channels,\nwhile enabling a more deep connection with their audiences. There,\nusers will be able to engage in expanded experiences such as virtual\nconcerts, events, NFT auctions, gamified content and educational\nresources that will contribute to reduce the margin of adoption.\n\nBeatBlox Music District stays loyal to the principle of content\ncare in regards to aesthetics and overall quality of the artwork.\nThis is at the core of every idea developed, from the stores to the\ninteractive installations and NFT associated services. We are creating\nstrategic alliances with music and blockchain fields referents for the\ndevelopment of user focused experiences and content. By doing this,\nwe aim to further promote and encourage the adoption and use\nof Decentraland.\n\nCome and visit us at 40,44.\n\nBeatBlox Marketplace and Academy:\n\nBy using Polygon and reducing minting costs significally,\nwe have succesfully implemented a NFTs sales and\ndistribution system that allows floor prices as low as USD 1.\nWe also gave birth to a concept in its entirety for our\nDecentraland district.\n\nIn this opportunity, we are reaching out to the community\nfor helping us to strength the development, the promotion\nand the scalability of an integral platform. This will add\nvalue to users in the metaverse, while helping to reduce\nadoption barriers for new participants\n\nThis platform will be leveraged by a marketplace with\nexpanded social functionalities, a curated catalog to\nensure high quality standards and an Academy to support\nthe adoption of new technologies linked to a further\ndemocratized access for artists and users to the vast\nopportunities that this technology provides.\n\nPlease refer to our documentation for further description:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nPlease refer to our documentation for a full description of our team, experience and background:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nPlease refer to our documentation for a full description of monthly goals, short to long term vision and budget breakdown:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q92fws8rJHaWKsJc-s_f3Nfhaih9jaE3/view?usp=sharing\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a1aa6a50-5c72-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174)**",

It is a real-life-like virtual shopping experience online 100% in 3D from any PC. We are working to bring the most important banks and retail banks to join this Meta Mall. We could do all transactions via Mana. Please visit the Meta Mall at www.go2virtual.shop\n\nThe problems we solve: no one online shipping experience lets a real-time 3D virtual but real experience to shoppers. Meta Mall makes real the \"try-before-you-buy\". The Metaverse needs a lot of Meta Mall and this proposal is ready-to-go to market with pretty corporate marketing to add the big retailers and banks to an immersive experience for their customers.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xc898485289c4f1E8d1bBEd5d175F9B6e1224df53\n\n## Description\n\nThe funds will be used in the following improvements:\n\n1.  To perform the shopping experience using the avatars already playing in Decentraland\n2.  To swift the payment term to Mana crypto instead of debit and credit cards\n3.  To integrate the current experience into  Decentraland environment\n4.  Corporative marketing  to add the main banks and brands in the Meta Mall of Decentraland\n5.  To create wow stores for the big brands with the Decentraland CG community\n\nA high-level skilled team is working together since May 2019 and it is integrated by 10 professionals including  3D artists,  3D UI professionals, Unreal programmers, Front-End, and backend developers. This team will lead all CG community members to develop stores and assets performed according to the needs of Meta Mall technologies.\n\nAll the stores for the companies will be a giant win opportunity for the CG community and the Metaverse users in general.  MANA will be used not only in shopping transactions but also to reward the CG contributions ( 3D stores and 3D assets). That´s why we are sure that Meta Mall will contribute to MANA´s growth in the next years.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPlease visit www.go2virtual.shop to feel our technology. We combine different technologies like Unreal Engine, real-time streaming focused on 3D interactions developed by our team, node.js, react, C++, and AWS cloud infrastructure.\n\nOur project is a continued development tool so will be listing more brands and stores every month.

    "title": "DAO Governance Proposal Stages",
    "body": "> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)\n\n**Summary**\n\nEstablish a robust and binding voting process for governance proposals.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nTo reduce the impact of spam and low quality proposals and increase time to assess implications and implementation pathways - each “Governance Proposal” should pass through three distinct stages. Proposals must meet specific criteria before they may be moved to the next stage. The end result is a binding governance decision.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nCommunity “Polls” are the only mechanism at this time for the community to vote on complicated governance issues, for example, on issues surrounding voting power, fee structures, and other socio-economic dynamics. The poll category is designed to be a non-binding gauge of community perceptions, not a binding governance proposal. However, in response to community feedback, the DAO Committee has taken on the practice of implementing polls as policy, in the absence of a more formal voting mechanism.\n\nThis is problematic for three reasons. First, the poll format does not allow time for consensus building and adequate assessment of impacts and implementation pathways. Second, there are no restrictions on who can submit a community poll, leading to spam proposals and there are no voting power thresholds to ensure important governance decisions are made by a representative majority (based on voting power). Finally, because polls are non-binding, their implementation has become dependent on the DAO committee, undermining the efficacy of the DAO and confidence in our governance process.\n\nThis proposal aims to establish a three-tiered voting process that begins with a “community poll” in its current form, and ends in a binding “governance proposal.”\n\n\\*\\*Specification \\*\\*\n\nThe voting process will include three tiers: Pre-Proposal Poll, Draft Proposal, and Governance Proposal. Each tier will have progressively increasing submission and passage thresholds.\n\n***Stage 1: Pre-Proposal Poll***\n\nThe purpose of the Pre-Proposal Poll is to introduce a governance issue to the community, gauge community sentiment, and determine if there is enough support to move forward with the drafting of an initial proposal. Pre-Proposal Polls can only pass to the Draft Proposal stage if they have accumulated a threshold of at least 500K VP. A poll that reaches at least 500K VP and does *not* garner a majority of participating voting power, may *still* advance to the Draft Proposal stage - ensuring all issues with enough support have an initial pathway toward passage into policy.\n\nPolls do not need to be composed in any specific form. They can be drafted in the full proposal format, or be presented as a straightforward question. Polls are currently the only option we have for governance issues that fall outside the established categories (Grants, name ban, catalysts and POIs).\n\n*   Submission Threshold: 100 VP (i.e. equivalent to one name)\n*   Passage Threshold: 500K VP\n*   Voting Period: 5 Days\n\n***Stage 2: Draft Proposal***\n\nThe purpose of the Draft Proposal is to present a potential policy to the community in a structured format and to formalize discussion about a proposal's potential impacts and implementation pathways. Draft Proposals must be structured in a particular form (see Annex 1), and can only pass to the binding Governance Proposal stage with a simple majority (51%) of participating voting power with a threshold of at least 1M VP. A Draft Proposal that fails or does not reach this threshold can be amended and resubmitted one time.\n\n*   Submission Threshold: 1,000 VP (or delegated VP)\n*   Passage Threshold: 1M VP\n*   Voting Period: 1 Week\n\n***Stage 3: Binding Governance Proposal***\n\nThe purpose of the Governance Proposal is to formalize the passed version of a Draft Proposal  into a binding governance outcome. Only established or recognized community members can submit Governance Proposals, which are only passed if they reach the needed acceptance criteria for their category. In the interim period before new voting categories have been established (and for proposals that do not have a pre-set category) a Governance Proposal must receive a simple majority (51%) of participating voting power and at least 6M VP to pass as a binding decision.\n\nProcesses and thresholds for established categories will not be changed as part of this proposal. Meaning, the process for grants, POIs, etc… will remain unchanged. Additional categories for specific types of issues, e,g, “fee structures,” will be proposed, and relevant processes and thresholds developed.\n\nGovernance Proposals must be structured in a particular form (see Annex 2).\n\n*   Submission Threshold: 2,500 VP (or delegated VP)\n*   Passage Threshold: 6M VP (or needed acceptance criteria for their category)\n*   Voting Period: 2 Weeks\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDAO Governance should be agile and responsive, however, at the same time tempered and deliberative. In its current form, important community decisions are being made on a week-to-week basis, and through non-binding community polls. The proposed voting framework will moderate the pace of our self-government and facilitate a detailed and deliberative process to ensure we make informed and representative decisions.\n\n(Annex outlying Draft & Governance Proposal format provided in forum)\n\n- For (1): Establish a three-tiered binding Governance Proposal process\n- For (2): Modify current use of Community Polls, however, amend this proposal\n- Against: Do Nothing/Maintain current use of Community Polls\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5193f850-5c00-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174)**",

    "title": "Community Module Creation: Gallery",
    "body": "> by 0xc24789c6f165329290ddd3fbeac3b6842a294003\n\nShould the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nI am seeking funding for the development of an easy-to-use module that will allow users to display their NFTs in a gallery format with minimal setup (simply adding their NFT details to a single file). This module will be made available to the community to help build up the repository of functional examples to act as a starting point for new developers and provide a useful scene that can be freely implemented into existing land.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n2,500 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003\n\n## Description\n\nStandard users within Decentraland (DCL) have quite a few resources on-hand to build a display to show off their NFTs, but all of them require a fair bit of work to. Users without programming experience can use the Builder to construct their own scenes or find some tutorials on YouTube, but this takes a lot of time for them to reach their simple goal of displaying their NFTs (especially if they are new to the space). Users with an understanding of how to code can read through the SDK and experience example scenes, but (once again) this is a time consuming process for most. On top of that, the quality of implementation will vary in the extreme.\n\nWhat I am to do with this module is provide general users with a module that can save them time and provide a good base-line for a quality display. This is a utility many users have been looking for and will no doubt provide a significant value to the community. By making more complex features within DCL more accessible via simplified interfaces we can get more users involved in developing the project's digital space. We can also provide users who lack an understanding of programming solutions that would otherwise be unavailable to them.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis module will allow users to display their art by interacting with a single well-documented file. The core functionality of the module will be hidden from the user, making management of their content significantly easier. Advanced users will also find it easy to modify the provided repository to form it to fit their own need. The default scene itself will feature a large display space for many NFTs, with the building sized for a 3x3 estate.\n\nThe completed module will also contain a walk-through of how to add NFTs to the project's scene and how to host their scene as a website for free (as an early development alternative to deploying the scene onto land). I believe that enabling users to not only create but also share their content easily will be key to building up this platform.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI'll be working on this project solo, again :). I've been programming for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). While I've only been developing in DCL for the past quarter of a year I have made good strides and am fully capable of implementing this project in the given time-frame. I've created several projects to learn the platform and have a good understanding of the development pipe-line.\n\nPrevious projects include:\n\\-[Minesweeper](https://decentraland-minesweeper-showcase.vercel.app/?position=0%2C0)\n\\-[Networked Checkers](https://decentraland-checkers-showcase.vercel.app/?position=0%2C0)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis project will be competed within 2 weeks of this proposal's acceptance. The basic roadmap is as follows:\n\n\\-Week 1: Implementation of core features, rough demo scene made available for feedback.\n\\-Week 2: Scene/code polish, implementation of suggested features within scope.\n\nAs with any project, there will likely be bugs/flaws in implementation. I'll be maintaining the main repo and will work towards fixing these as they get flagged.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=cd0db440-5ac4-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174)**",

We already have some mockup for the nfts and a pretty well established roadmap.\nNote that NFT holders will be able to claim tokens every week! ($ MSP) on a value of 1.2 per NFT owned!\n\nI am therefore asking for your help to finance the project and finally launch what we have wanted to do for a long time !!\n\nWhy not adapt our nft to a metaverse game afterwards!\n\nThanks again for reading!\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe would be on a long-term vision, that is to say that our nft will provide you with free underwear for life (around 2 per year per nft) all thanks to the nft owning!\nThe token gain will be there to reward our nft holders and give you access to votes for future partners or for the next event.\nAll we need is the development of smart contracts and an integration on a website (almost entirely done).\nThe more you hold, the more your opinion will have an impact on the future of the project! We are counting on you and your support!\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThere are 3 of us on the project and we know that having to change our underwear is a really nasty task! the price may vary and you will waste part of your budget for future vacations! Thanks to our project, you would only need to invest once to hold a nft and request your underwear for free (shipping costs offered anywhere in the world).\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMetaSlip is still too young to be able to guarantee flawless success, but with your support we could finally launch the nft mint by Q1 2022 and deliver your first reward tokens around Q2-Q3 2022.\n\nThe request to send your underwear will be in 2023 according to the affiliate partners!\nwe hope we can get into gaming projects and drop our underwear there all over the metaverse. If there is mass adoption we should be able to do that by Q2 2023 - Q1 2024.\n\nThe project is certainly for the long term but think about your underwear that you will have to buy back during its years!

WonderMine is often the most popular location in Decentraland, with over 10,000 daily users in recent days.\n\nWe want to improve WonderMine and the other games in the WonderZone Amusement Park, making WonderZone and Decentraland the go-to places for play-to-earn metaverse games.\n\nLink to WonderMine: https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-28%2C56\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xfcacAcE2713D41c02666E2643E5583793196c935\n\n## Description\n\nWhen creating WonderMine, our initial goal was to give players a fun reason to log in to Decentraland every day. We started with simple game mechanics, resources, and crafting rules so people can immediately start playing without a steep learning curve. We also wanted it to be a social hub for Decentraland players.\n\nWe are proud of what we have built so far, and the great player community that has formed around the game. But improving the game has taken longer than we wanted. We owe it to the players to add game play features and offer more craftable wearables and NFTs. As a part-time team we haven’t had the time or funding to fully dedicate ourselves to WonderZone.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAcquiring funding through the DAO would let us dedicate more time to development, and hire an additional developer to help us improve WonderMine and other games in WonderZone park. Here is what we plan on expanding and improving:\n\n**Server improvements**\nTo make the crafting experience and the overall gameplay experience more smooth, we’ll bring on a server-side developer to help us build a more solid server infrastructure. This is a high priority because we’ve had server performance issues during previous events, with a sudden influx of new players. It’s vital to ensure scalability as our games become popular.\n\n**WonderZone NFTs**\nMany of our players have been waiting anxiously for WonderZone NFTs, Diamond tipped Pickaxe, WonderGem Pickaxe and NFT fishing poles eventually. We will fast track the development of our proprietary NFTs once we acquire the necessary funding.\n\n**Shared meteors and meteor tiers**\nCurrently in WonderMine, players can’t see the meteors that other players are mining.  Shared meteors will be an additional class of meteor that can be seen by everyone in the scene. **This will introduce some interesting competition and collaboration into the game**. The shared meteors will be more rare and valuable in general, and require more than one person to mine them. These rare meteors might drop all over the park, so a valuable meteor could drop in a distant place in the park, and you will have to gather people from the mining field to help you mine it, and you will all share the rewards!\n\n**Kingfisher social fishing game**\nSome of you know that we already ran 2 beta tests of our newest game “Kingfisher”, which is a social fishing game. Kingfisher will be integrated into the WonderZone crafting economy. The materials you fish will be used in combination with WonderMine materials to craft wearables in the future. Some of the funding will go towards bug fixing and improving it so we can finally release it in 2022!\n\nKingfisher playthrough by Peanutbutta:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj436P3ohCU\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**The team**\n\n*   **Rob Dixon (Radix)**, Co-founder, lead developer\n*   **Chestnutbruze**, Co-founder, 3D artist\n*   **Lew** Co-founder, 3D artist\n*   **maruudn** Community manager\n*   **Maricela Perdomo (Maricela)** 3D artist\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**2022 Q1**\n\n*   Server improvements\n*   WonderZone NFTs\n*   Shared meteors\n*   New wearables\n*   Aesthetic improvement of in-game assets\n*   In-game highscore leaderboards with monthly rewards/tournaments\n\n**2022 Q2**\n\n*   Release Kingfisher, a new social fishing game\n*   More meteor tiers, rarer meteors with more valuable materials\n*   Wearables Shop and Ticket System\n*   In-game Pets\n*   More wearables\n*   Expand WonderMine to other scenes across Decentraland\n*   Restructuring of the park\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=90f57aa0-5908-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174)**",

    "body": "> by 0xd2172778f6132b2619dc07d71a0a0f068e0883c3 (DerekMelchin#83c3)\n\nThe Catalyst Nodes Monitor (https://catalyst-monitor.vercel.app/) shows Decentraland currently has around 1,000-1,800 active members at any given time. The low amount of active users may be a result of a large percentage of Decentraland being undeveloped or underdeveloped. The majority of Decentraland being underdeveloped may be a result of land owners not having the skills or resources needed to develop the amazing experiences we all know Decentraland is capable of rendering.\n\nTo address the underdeveloped land and lack of high-quality user engagement zones, should the marketplace be expanded to match two new sets of market participants?\n\n*   Match land owners  with renters\n*   Match people who need DCL developers  with people who specialize in DCL development (modeling, blockchain programming, game developers, etc...)\n\nI think this is an easy extension to the Decentraland marketplace that would significantly increase the amount of development in DCL, which would increase the number of active members. What do you think?\n\nThe Decentraland Discord server currently serves to match these sets of market participants through open discussion, but a lot of the third-party brokers that offer such services are poorly done, inactive, largely centralized, or expensive. Decentraland has an opportunity to offer a built-in solution to reduce fees, improve user engagement, and grow the community.

    "title": "I propose that if the cost of claiming an NFT name is dropped to 25 MANA, any wallet that holds an NFT name that was claimed for 100 MANA will be credited 75 MANA per name.  Are you in favor?",
    "body": "> by 0x43b2cc9004630b2912abbce0fdf09ff5a3cc144b (Aardvark)\n\nThese are several of the reasons for the need for this proposal:\n\n1.  Over 30,000 names have been claimed for 100 MANA each. Each of these names currently has 100 voting power. If we reduce the cost of the names, does the voting power also drop? Does it drop just for those that claim a name for a lower price? If so, who will track which names were claimed at full price and which were claimed at reduced price to determine voting power? If the voting power is reduced for all names including those that were claimed for 100 MANA, then it will create an inequity in voting power distribution.\n\n2.  Owning an NFT name is not a requirement for participating in any activities in Decentraland. It is purely optional. In fact, anyone can enter Decentraland and use any name of their choice at any time for free. It will just have several additional characters added at the end as an extension. Therefore, I question the need to reduce the price of names at all.\n\n3.  It seems that virtually every day there are several names claimed for 100 MANA each. If people are willing to continue to pay 100 MANA to claim a name then there should be no reason to reduce the price.\n\n4.  Many of those that claimed one or more of the 30,000 existing names for 100 MANA did so as an investment. These are NFT’s that have value. If the cost of claiming a named is dropped, it will completely change the value structure of these NFT’s. All those that were claimed for 100 MANA will drop in value.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=6fb40230-5552-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174)**",

    "body": "> by 0x905163dd4b786359b5293eb54568e99b145a4a34 (Pico#4a34)\n\nThis proposal aims to return Land to the community of original Contributors of District X (formerly known as “Red Light District”). District X, which is one of the largest on the platform, has been appropriated by an authoritarian District Leader who has chosen to flout community rules, ignore contributors whilst operating and managing the District as a single entity for personal gain. District Leader now claims ownership of over 2,000 (!) Land. This, we argue, goes against the rationale and ethos of Decentraland and its community.\n\nWe propose that District X contributors should be given the opportunity to present their case to the DAO in order to regain decentralised, accountable and democratic control of the District. Contributors should be returned the rightful ownership of their Land, which, after all, they contributed to make the District possible in the first place. If approved, Land ownership should be transferred back to Contributors. We seek advice on two possible resolutions: complete ownership or a royalty system.\n\nMore information, including a timeline and a petition can be found:\n\nhttps://realdistrictx.medium.com/district-x-on-decentraland-a8e10279e874\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/decentraland-leadership-petition-to-free-and-democratise-district-x-in-decentraland-207f0677-85b0-42aa-ba56-6a6d1cc1585b\n\n- Complete ownership of Land to Contributors\n- Royalty system for Original Contributors\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=706c3a30-5548-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174)**",

Sugar Club is now a popular hub for fun , aesthetic and curated parties in the metaverse with a growing brand across the metaverse.\n\nAt the moment we use a small dedicated server for video streaming that doesn’t scale properly during peak times at events . Players have reported the video screens freezing or not playing at all at peak times.\n\nWhile this set up has served us well up until now , it is becoming clear that Decentraland is growing and that in order to accommodate this growth we need funding for upgrading our dedicated servers.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOur plan is to scale the servers to a monthly Vimeo subscription as well as creating a dedicated server as back up . This set up could potentially scale up to 1000 users or more during peak times. we believe that for now this should be enough to currently scale.\n\nTherefore we request a grant tier 2 (one time payment of 3000 usd) to fulfill our technical requirements.\n\nThe budget break down:\n\nVimeo premium :                100 usd /month\n\nDedicated back up server:  250 usd /month\n\nDev costs:                           50 usd /month\n\nTotal :                                 400 usd /month or 4800 usd / year\n\nRequested funds for 1 year (tier 2 ) : 250 usd/month or 3000 usd / year\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nSugar Club founder (Kay)\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SugarClub\\_\ndiscord: @sugarclub.eth#9693\n\nIn charge of content creation , curation, marketing and party host.

    "title": "Education Everywhere- Build a learning center",
    "body": "> by 0x915aa85dc088ea2d5850d44f9a21c7bf388a9672 (TeacherBrooke#9672)\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks a grant to purchase a plot of decentralized land on which to build a learning facility (\"METAcademy\") for seekers of knowledge, mentoring, and socialization with others. METAcademy would be a site for learners and educators to interact with knowledge together by sharing online classrooms about any topic imaginable. Additionally, this space would function as a study environment and safe, social zone for intellectuals. As an educator with nearly a decade of experience teaching online and in traditional buildings, it is apparent that education should take the next step toward integrating with technology to provide learners the optimal setting for educating. Learn from the comfort of your computer and be part of the future!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x915Aa85DC088ea2d5850d44f9A21c7BF388A9672\n\n## Description\n\nAccess to knowledge should be a right--not a privilege. From the most remote corners of the word to new online societies, a main objective should be to spread knowledge and promote learning. Information should not be limited by language, location, or liquidity but rather compared, contrasted, and critiqued. In an era when information is at the tip of a finger, education must shift to a focus on verifying information, processing knowledge, and applying techniques to our lives. METAcademy would be a base for a variety of courses and classes for learners to pursue. From physical fitness and cooking to traditional English and mathematics, this new realm of education would offer learners revolutionized access to topics and concepts. Learners may enter METAcademy and select from a running list of subjects--some of which may take place on Jupiter or in ancient China. Let Shakespeare talk about his time or learn the Pythagorean Theorem from Pythagorus himself. Work completed within the METAcademy may be minted as NFTs for collectibles within Decentraland, with duplicates donated to the learning facility collections. Learners may utilize \"rooms\" within the METAcademy to study alone or with peers and participate in discussions. Enter the next generation of education and learn something new today!\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo obtain the name \"METAcademy\" within decentraland, it would cost .007328 ETH. Also, the cheapest parcel of land currently listed for sale is located at -56, -133 for 3,450 ETH.  Alternatively, this design may work with other, more fiscal hosting options. A GoFundMe has also been created to promote donations from intellectuals hoping to secure a location for safe and limitless learning: https://gofund.me/d300c2e2 . This location would act as a host for the different classes offered by teacher users. Learners could assemble and select a class and teacher within the server to be relocated for sessions. Educators may utilize their Avatars to interact with students within Decentraland, list zoom links for online class learning, or use Google systems for materials, links, and videos. Several starter NFTs have already been minted for interaction including the building and emotes: 0xee8f3df7e0a66f2943133eb43dd29b354df060f9\nContracts for educators would include sections which agree to refrain from certain interactions and content. Educators would be independent contractors responsible for the materials, instruction, and feedback for learners.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI'm TeacherBr00ke (Brooke Cadieu) and I proposed this learning facility after discovering the new society of online users looking to shape the future. I graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga with a degree in English education for grades 6-12. I received my teaching license from the state of Tennessee and educated in public schools in Chattanooga for several years. Within the brick-and-mortar classroom, I fostered relationships with students and experienced the difficulty of educating large groups of students in real time. Specifically, intrusions of personal space and bullying were common detractions from everyday learning. Further, I noticed a need for specified learning for students with varying interests and skills. This meant that the traditional path and curriculum was not benefitting every student equally. Thus, I realized that learning should be more flexible and interest-driven.\n\nI later switched my educating to online courses offered to students located in China. In these classrooms, students ages 3-15 would log on with a camera and microphone to learn English. With nearly a thousand students and over one-hundred thousand minutes taught online, I learned that every, single student has different needs. Samples of my online teaching can be viewed on Teacher Brooke YouTube. However, regulations in China prohibited the connection of servers from outside Mainland China to continue and I could no longer teach my students in this region.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nBeginning phases should be expected to take approximately three months to procure a location, mint features and emotes, enlist educators, enroll students, and advertise beginning courses. Within the first month, a location for the facility would purchased and design for its interior and grounds would begin. Also, infrastructure for learning environments would be established. By month two, advertisement for educators would begin with applications and contracts submitted for proposed learning topics. Contracts would be signed before educators could submit a course for review. Proposed courses would be reviewed before listed in the curriculum. Advertisements for student sign-ups would begin. By month three, preliminary courses would be offered within Decentraland for students. Over the remaining start-up time, additional courses and educators would be made available and feedback would refine courses for learners. Once the program is fully sufficient, works created within METAcademy will be featured in a collection for viewing, collecting, and showcasing the learning done within METAcademy.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b15dc250-53c4-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

    "title": "Should we convert 1/8th of the DAO’s MANA to stablecoin to diversify and stabilize the treasury?",
    "body": "> by 0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc\n\n#### Summary\n\nGiven the amount of MANA owned by the Decentraland DAO, we should diversify these holdings between Decentraland's native token (MANA) and stable coins to make the DAO’s treasury more secure.\n\n**The DAO should allocate one-eight (1/8) of the treasury, or `4,357,187` MANA, to a portfolio of stable coins including equal proportions of USDT, USDC, and DAI.**\n\nThe added stability resulting from this diversification will better empower the DAO to fulfill its various financial obligations (e.g. the community grants program) over a longer period of time.\n\nWhile the formation of a DAO Treasury Committee might result in a more complex and performant financial strategy, this initial proposal aims to suggest a simple change that our community can make right now to immediately help to protect and sustain the DAO's funding.\n\n#### Abstract\n\nOn February 20, 2020, the Decentraland DAO was created and given 222 million MANA by means of a 10 year vesting contract. (Sign into Metamask or connect your wallet to view the [DAO's vesting dashboard](https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac).) This MANA was set aside to support the continued development of the Decentraland platform by funding decisions made by MANA holders and LAND owners through the DAO.\n\nAs of the time this proposal was published,  `34,857,497` of that MANA is now available to the DAO's treasury. At a current market value of ~150,000,00 USD.\n\nThe Treasury also has 5,392,411 USD in stable coins at the moment used to fund grants. The original proposal to convert 1/5 of the Treasury to stablecoins [was approved here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=69b89db0-de87-11eb-815a-1f002ccf0372).\n\nMaintaining a stable treasury is a critical step toward enabling the DAO to fulfill its obligations to the Decentraland community. The recently approved [Grants Framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c02ff450-2783-11ec-ac84-77607720a240) specifies new grant tiers to be paid in stablecoins.\nMaintaining a cushion of stable coins within the treasury will help to maximize the number, size, and duration of grants that the DAO can fund in the long term.\n\nMany other DAOs are beginning to explore initiatives such as this, as is discussed in [this article and the related report](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/dao-treasury-balance-sheet-management-ce5e96da34ac) from the Blockchain Capital blog.\n\n***In conclusion, the DAO should exchange 1/8th of its treasury (or  `4,357,187` MANA) for a portfolio of stable coins containing equal proportions of USDT, USDC, and DAI.***\n\nThe remaining 7/8ths of the treasury will remain in MANA.\n\n#### Specification\n\n1/8th of the DAO's existing treasury, or  `4,357,187`  MANA, is to be exchanged for USDC, USDT, and DAI stable coins, in equal proportions. Using the current price of MANA (4.8 USD/MANA) this transaction will generate ~`20,914,498` USD\n\nThe transaction is to be conducted by the DAO Committee's multisig using DEX protocols over a period of several weeks ensuring to get an average price and minimizing the impact on markets liquidity.\n\n#### For\n\nApprove the proposed asset allocation and delegate the transaction to the DAO Committee.\n\n#### Against\n\nReject the proposed asset allocation.\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=34e58e10-52cf-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

    "title": "Refund MANA Difference for Wearables Submitted by Creators After the Publication Fee Adjustment Poll and Before its Enactment",
    "body": "> by 0xe58d9940a395d303e691dbe0676710d9c140101a (Archonomous)\n\n**Summary:** This proposal is in favor of refunding the fee publication cost difference to wearable Creators *only* for wearables submitted *after* the passing of the recent fee publication adjustment proposal, *and before* the adjustment was implemented.\n\n**Overview:** The wearable publication cost was recently adjusted from the original fee of 500 MANA per item to a new $500 USD-pinned fee that updates weekly based on the approximate price of MANA in USD.\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5\n\nThis adjustment was voted on in the DAO (link above) and concluded on *November 7th, 2021*. Following the passing of the proposal, there was a duration of time before the fee change went into effect. This refund proposal would *only* affect wearables submitted during this period of 'limbo', where the changes were approved, but hadn't yet been enacted.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\n*(1)* Establish a time stamp for when the approved wearable publishing fee adjustment went into public affect on the https://builder.decentraland.org/ domain\n\n*(2)* Determine which wearables were published at the original 500 MANA fee *after* the DAO approval on 10:13AM on November 7th, 2021 (snapshot below) and *before* the time stamp established from step (1)\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/snapshot.dcl.eth/proposal/QmZ8DGYqLb8yVCmiN8XmnqyYu3BMw8bS23NJWQ2335PQQW\n\n*(3)* Calculate, audit, and issue credit back to affected creators for the price difference according to the newly-approved and implemented system applied to MANA prices at the original time of publication.\n\nFor example, if 2 wearables were published by Creator X on November 10th for 1,000 MANA and the price of MANA was $4 USD at that time, then the actual price per the enacted DAO proposal would be 125 MANA ( = $500 USD ) for each wearable. According to this math, Creator X should've paid only 250 MANA rather than 1,000 and would be eligible to receive a 750 MANA refund while still having paid the updated publication fee.\n\n**Purpose:** Why is this important to the Decentraland community? As an involved community member and creator myself, I understand the importance creators have on the growth of this fantastic community and social ecosystem. During this 'limbo' period, although it was no more than a week or so, many creators were dissuaded from publishing content knowing that the fees were going to be adjusted to a lower price.\n\nFor some, deadlines do not permit us to be selective about when we submit wearables for review, so for those that were negatively impacted by this short-lived situation, this would be appropriate compensation. Lastly, it should also be stated that this is a unique scenario and that few creators actually submitted during this time, so the total impact is relatively small making this a feasible proposal to take on and address.\n\nThank you kindly for your time and consideration ~\n\n- Agree to Refund MANA Difference to Affected Creators\n- Do Not Refund MANA Difference to Affected Creators\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=230d7750-5227-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

    "title": "Should we establish the conditions under which users can use Decentraland’s logo and name?",
    "body": "> by 0x80c822c59e73f2a5d3130c19e381d9be45e41e38\n\n**Summary**\n\nProposal for terms under which members of the Decentraland community may use Decentraland’s name and logo\n\n**Motivation**\n\nCurrently, there is uncertainty among users as to when and how Decentraland’s name and logo may be used. This question comes up most often in relation to creating wearables or social media profiles.\n\nDecentralization and community ownership are core values of Decentraland, so user generated content is paramount.  In the spirit of supporting UGC and community ownership, the community should have clearer guidelines for when and how individuals can use the Decentraland name and logo.\n\n**Proposal**\n\n\\_Terms of Use for Decentraland’s Logo and Name \\_\n\nDecentraland is a decentralized virtual world governed by its users and as such strongly supports user generated content (UGC). People may use the Decentraland logo and name in their creations within Decentraland, but must follow the following terms.\n\n1.  **Allowable Usage.** Users shall comply with these terms as well as Decentraland’s Terms of Use (https://decentraland.org/terms/) and Content Policy (https://decentraland.org/content/) in order to be allowed to use the Decentraland name and logo within Decentraland.\n2.  **Logo and name ownership.** The Decentraland Foundation is the registered owner of the Decentraland name and logo, acting for the benefit of the DAO. This is because currently the DAO lacks formal legal status.\n3.  **Wearables and user names in Decentraland.** Users may create wearables and names using the Decentraland logo and name on the Decentraland platform, provided that they don't violate the platform's Content Policy and Terms of Use. As far as the Decentraland Foundation is concerned, you are not prevented from monetizing or obtaining profits from the sale of said wearables or user names. The NFT must be unique in design. The Decentraland Foundation has the right to deny the use of the Decentraland name and logo at its sole discretion in any case and at any time.\n4.  **NFTs and other uses outside the Decentraland platform.** The Decentraland Foundation does not authorize the creation of NFTs using the Decentraland name or logo outside the Decentraland platform. The use of the Decentraland name or logo is not allowed in other virtual platforms different from Decentraland or in the real world.\n5.  **Disclaimer.** In all written materials relating to your product, including websites, publications, etc. it must be made clear that you do not have any kind of affiliation, business partnerships or other official association with Decentraland, the DAO or the Decentraland Foundation.\n6.  **Press Releases.** Any press releases that you distribute through social networks, media or news services should clearly state that you do not have  any kind of affiliation, business partnerships or other official association with Decentraland, the DAO or the Decentraland Foundation.\n7.  **Advertisements.** Any paid advertisement that uses the Decentraland name or logo is generally not allowed and must first be approved by the Decentraland Foundation or the DAO. To seek such approval, you can send an email to: legal@decentraland or through a DAO proposal.\n8.  **The Name \"Decentraland\".** Subject to these terms you can use the name “Decentraland” to promote your game(s) or wearables as long as it doesn’t confuse consumers and as long as it is not used as the name of an app or any kind of merchandise or product. In other words, you can refer to “Decentraland” as the name of the platform, and you can use the name to show your interest in or affection for the Decentraland platform.\n9.  **The Logo \"Decentraland\".**  Subject to these terms, you are only allowed to use the logo design that is available at the following URL: https://www.figma.com/file/pBiYuNALsSEFncGy3x6dIZ/DecentralandLogo?node-id=3162%3A117. The Decentraland Foundation or the DAO may alter the form of this design from time to time. You are allowed to resize the logo as long as you do not modify the proportions. But otherwise, you cannot modify the logo design in any way and must abide by these terms.\n10. **Additional Rules.**\n\n*   (A) THE USE OF DECENTRALAND LOGO AND NAME CANNOT BE ASSOCIATED WITH ANYTHING THAT VIOLATES THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS, THIRD PARTIES IP, CREATES BRAND CONFUSION, HAS HARMFUL OR OBJECTIONABLE ASPECTS OR DOES NOT COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS OR ANY OF DECENTRALAND GUIDELINES, TERMS OR RULES. THE DAO AND THE DECENTRALAND FOUNDATION HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE (IN THEIR SOLE DISCRETION) WHETHER THE USE IS ACCEPTABLE.\n*   (B) YOU MUST NOT USE THE DECENTRALAND NAME OR LOGO IN ANY MANNER THAT IS LIKELY TO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE REPUTATION OF DECENTRALAND (AS THE DAO OR DECENTRALAND FOUNDATION MAY DETERMINE IN THEIR SOLE DISCRETION). YOU MAY NOT USE THE DECENTRALAND NAME OR LOGO IN ANY WAY THAT SUGGESTS THAT YOU ARE AFFILIATED WITH DECENTRALAND, THE DAO OR THE DECENTRALAND FOUNDATION, OR IN ANY WAY THAT SUGGESTS THAT DECENTRALAND, THE DAO OR THE DECENTRALAND FOUNDATION SPONSORS OR ENDORSES YOUR USAGE.\n*   (C) These terms grant  permission to you to use the Decentraland  trademarks only in the ways described above. The Decentraland Foundation or the DAO may withdraw or change this permission at any time for any reason.\n*   (D) Other uses of the Decentraland logo and name require the express approval of the Decentraland Foundation or the DAO.\n\nIf approved, the Decentraland Foundation shall upload these terms of use for the Decentraland Logo and Name to the website at www.decentraland.org.\n\n**For:** Approve the proposed terms\n\n**Against:** Reject the proposed terms\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e478dce0-5137-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

Just change the publication fee to a new value: 100 MANA.\n\n### Motivation\n\n*   The price of MANA went from 0.7 to 5 USD.\n*   Reduce the entry barrier for new creators.\n\n### Specification\n\nThe Security Advisory Board should update the fee using their multisig.\n\nThey need a clear proposal making the fee explicit and having sufficient VP to enact it.

(Everyone can keep multiple identities)\n\n—DigiFun: Provides communication platform, financial support and support to creators;\n—Designers: Responsible for the appearance design for clothing, buildings or other Decentraland products;\n\n—Modelers: Complete the modeling work of the specific product based on the manuscript provided by the designers;\n\n—Advisers: Participate in the whole process of product design and development, providing suggestions for designers and modelers to adopt;\n\n—Proposers: DAO members can offer proposals for Decentraland's virtual works and the development of DigiFunDAO. Proposals can proceed to the formal stage after receiving enough votes during the presentation stage;\n\n—Decision makers: DigiFun product holders (POAP, clothing, etc.) can become decision makers. The official listing of products on self requires the votes by DAO members, and will be adopted only when a certain percentage of votes will be reached (also votes for a better product, letting everyone get involved in building a better future for DCL)\n\nSolutions for potential problems\n\n1.  When the DAO organization expands, if there is a conflict between the interests of some DAO members and the overall interests of the project (for example, PoW miners prevent PoS improvement), then it can be solved by POAP dividends/buyback or destruction to ensure that the overall benefits of the project can be returned to DAO in some way.\n2.  Regarding governance enthusiasm, we will motivate DAO members by airdropping NFT for the governance, but will not make promise to the encouragement, to avoid the phenomenon of click farming.\n3.  Stability of governance. The increase of weight requires certain plans to ensure the stability of overall voting. A linear mechanism similar to DeFI will be adopted to ensure the stability of decision-making system.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nAudrey：Project President /University of the Arts London / Fashion Buyer / worked for Bestseller\n\nMomo：Art Development Leader / Fine Art in Tsinghua University / Expert in digital art and generative art\n\nZeo： Full-Stack Developer /PhD Computer Science in Tsinghua University / React, Solidity, Go, Python\n\nBruce：Economic Developer and Financial Manager / Economic and Finance in LSE / Machine Learning in Tsinghua University\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nSuppose the funds application is approved in one month, then the following activities will be launched:\n2021/12/30 -- Set up a forum\n2022/1/01 – Start preliminary marketing\n2022/1/05 -- Recruit designers and modelers\n2022/02/25 -- Set up DigiFunDAO official website\n2022/04/03 - Large scale NFTs airdropping\n\nWith the approved fund, we will conduct multiple tasks simultaneously in order to complete our tasks as planned. We are also aiming to expand our community to 100,000 members in two years' time, allowing more people to join us and experience the meta-universe and plan the creative development of DCL together.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=cf170850-4b9b-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

Both the skills will have a maximum level of 99. Players earn xp as they play the game (Magic xp for using magic spells and Health xp for healing). Health will determine the maximum healthpoints a player can have while Magic will determine the damage the player can deal to other players (and potentially unlock new spells).\n\nCombat:\nCombat will be many vs one. On killing another player (Last damage) , you receive half of their bounty while the other half gets added to your bounty. Last player gets the remaining bounty.\nMagic Spells will be used to attack other players in the game. The spellbook will consider of many different spells with each having different attributes (maximum damage, accuracy,\nspeed/reload time, minimum skill needed to use, special attributes).\nApart from the spellbook, each player will also get a fixed quantity food which they can use to heal during the game.\n\nDrops and Rewards:\nApart from the bounty earned by killing players during the game, players will also receive Reward chests. Opening these chests will give them NFT items that can be consumed during the game for an advantage (example: portions to boost your damage by 5% for next 3 attacks)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPython server hosted on a google cloud VM will handle all the game logics.\n\nPlayer details and game state will be stored on firebase for the time being.\n\nAll NFT drops and items will be handled using smart contracts on polygon chain.\n\nMost of the game logics have been explained in the description.\n\nFeel free to hit me up with any follow-up questions\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nRyan Pal: https://www.linkedin.com/in/palryan/\n\nPrakhar Singhal: https://www.linkedin.com/in/prakharsinghal/\n\nMayank Agarwal: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayank-agrawal-iitk/\n\nWe are a team of graduates from IIT Kanpur.

These will be led by doctors and consultants with particular expertise in that field. We aim for these events to be highly interactive and therefore highly valuable for the participants.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4748629B341aE21D5009Ae425DFa79e9Fd852282\n\n## Description\n\n\\*\\*\\* Please note this is a resubmission following our previous grant request and feedback from the community and developers. The overwhelming feedback was that this is a concept that will be highly valued and useful within the space, however, the focus should be to start smaller and grow based on the response from the community\n\nWe are therefore asking for a small grant initially to pilot the concept of a health education space, and run a small series of health education classes with a focus on some key health topics which will be of high value to the community.\n\nWhat we hope to achieve long term;\n\nSolving health inequalities;\n\n*   Access to expertise across several fields of medicine, psychiatry and surgery, who will provide health education to the users of Decentraland (no matter where in the world you are from) \n\nImproving health;\n\n*   Focussing on key health issues, we can aim to improve and empower users, through education, to make healthy choices and understand more about disease and medicine \n\nMental health support;\n\n*   With access to psychiatrists and psychologists, we will have a particular focus on mental health education and support. We know this is a key issue globally, and in particular amidst the global pandemic. \n\nCommunity driven;\n\n*   We want to ensure we are delivering and catering to the needs of the community. We will ensure that the direction of our educational events are driven by the community, and focussed on the areas that matter the most to you. \n\nHow we hope to achieve this;\n\n*    Weekly live educational events Each week there will be a doctor led event, where education on a particular health topic will be delivered to the community. These will be interactive, and include dedicated time for questions and answers.  \n*    Dedicated sessions on mental health Delivered by psychiatrists/psychologists, we will have sessions dedicated purely for mental health support and chats.  \n*    A list of trusted health professionals We will continue to build on our bank of trusted healthcare professionals, all of whom will be fully registered and indemnified by their national medical councils.\n\nThe future aims of the project;\nWe are hoping to expand our project to run virtual medical clinics for the users of Decentraland. This will mean that you can access a one on one appointment with a fully trained and indemnified doctor/nurse for health advice/management.\nThere are several legal and indemnity requirements that need to be addressed in order for this to become a reality, and we hope that these can be worked out sooner rather than later (watch this space!)... this will be a world's first in the Metaverse.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe are already in a unique position to access a wide number of leading experts in healthcare and medicine, to deliver excellent health education events.\n\nWith the funds raised from the grant, we will look to hire a programmer and developer to help with the creation and running of the events.\n\nThe funds will also be utilised to pay for the health professionals time during the educational events.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nProject Lead - Dr I Farooqi UK based General Practitioner, qualified in 2014. Clinical education lead, Clinical Supervisor, and Covid Vaccination Lead\n\n*    We will look to hire a programmer/developer with experience of the Decentraland user interface and platform. This will be needed to create the required platform within Decentraland to enable our educational events.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nROADMAP AND MILESTONES\n\nMonth 1\n\n*   Recruit an experienced programmer/developer to work on the Decentraland platform \n\nMonth 2-3\n\n*   Create and run a schedule for the educational events and mental health support events, booking in the necessary health professionals to deliver the events. \n\nMonth 4\n\n*   Reflect and gather community feedback on the above, and determine whether an additional larger grant is necessary for expanding the project\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ae86cb20-4add-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

    "body": "> by 0xcf10cd8b5dc2323b1eb6de6164647756bad4de4d (Eibriel)\n\nFollowing on my 2 previous proposals to improve the [moderation](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f68cd110-3e8c-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5) and [safety](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=3b2b86c0-3e8a-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5) tools on Decentraland.\n\nThis one improves on the previous ones by allowing the owners of a land to fully control the moderation of their own scenes, without affecting other scenes.\n\nWhen developing a scene with the SDK a new new element can be added to `requiredPermissions` on `scene.json`: `ALLOW_TO_BLOCK_USERS_INSIDE_SCENE`.\n\nThe developer can call to `blockUser()`\nWith the following parameters\n\n    setUserBlockStatus( \n         \"0x000....\",\n        {\n            chat: true,\n            voice: true,\n            avatar_sounds: true\n        }\n    )\n\nThat call will instruct the Client to block (or unblock) an user while the player's avatar is inside the scene, for the duration of the current session. A notification could be shown to the player to let them know about the change.\n\nThis will allow for the following:\n\n*   PlayerA enters the scene\n*   PlayerB enters the scene and starts harassing other players via voice\n*   A moderator sets `voice: false` on a server for PlayerB\n*   Since PlayerA's scene has the necessary logic to connect to that server it receives the change, and executes `setUserBlockStatus` with PlayerB's address and `voice: false` as parameters\n*   If PlayerB exits the scene PlayerA still can't hear PlayerB\n*   If PlayerA also exits the scene PlayerA can now hear PlayerB\n\nAll the logic on who should be blocked is handled exclusively in the scene's code (with the aid of an optional authoritative server), without any involvement of the Catalysts.\n\n- Implement it\n- Don't implement it\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4a46f040-497f-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

    "body": "> by 0x2b17cad25b19a2a7404f44ae5eba941f41cc862d\n\nShould the following Tier 1: up to $1,500 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to perform a systematic analysis on all community proposals made to the DAO between May 2021 and Nov 2021 to discover trends and understand if there could be improvements to the DAO proposal mechanism designed to increase valuable proposals acceptance rate. A higher proposal quality will foster community engagement and result in a better community experience.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n1,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2B17CAd25B19A2a7404F44AE5EBa941F41cc862D\n\n## Description\n\nBetween May 2021 and Nov 2021 there have been 353 community proposals made to the DAO. The hypothesis behind this research is that there were valuable ideas behind the rejected proposals that were not expressed cohesively in order for its value to be easily comprehensible. This research project will systematically review all community proposals made between those dates and analyze dimensions such as length, title description, use of acronyms, clear output, set dates, etc. to uncover trends. The output will be a list of changes and recommendations on the community proposal process to address the discoveries made, if any.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis research project will be carried out in three phases:\n\n*   Phase 1: Data Collection. Determine qualitative and quantitative analysis dimensions. Review all 353 proposals and systematically evaluate them against analysis criteria.\n*   Phase 2: Data Analysis. Perform quantitative and qualitative research in order to discover trends and potential casualties on the proposal outcomes.\n*   Phase 3: Recommendations. Produce suggestions on potential improvements for the DAO community proposal based on the research findings.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nFranco Amorosi. Economist, MSc in Public Policy. LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/francoamorosi.\n\nI’m eager to get involved with Decentraland’s community. What interests me is to understand how DAO’s governance works and to design mechanisms that improve community engagement.\n\nI will donate the grant from this research project to Amnesty International, an NGO that protects people’s human rights like free speech, and campaigns to end abuses such as discriminatory laws.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nPhase 1: Data Collection. 1 month.\nPhase 2: Data Analysis. 2 weeks.\nPhase 3: Recommendations. 2 weeks.\n\nThis project will be completed and the final report shared by the end of January 2022.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=08d8a080-4962-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

This means  capturing a market while in its infancy. More users creating accounts to make purchases, or visit shops , and in return more impressions for other users and other projects on the Metaverse.\n\nAfrica's internet infrastructure is pretty much non existent, or very poor where it exists, we are happy to be one of the few companies building it. What this means for the young people doing business online, it is challenging, also for the few who have managed to conquer the internet they frequently face multiple roadblocks like nonexistent platform integration ie pay pal failure to integrate Mobile money though some progress has been made towards this end it has been long overdue. There is a nonexistent bridge between Credit cards a payment mode dominant in the west. This means restricted capital flows hence a problem resolved by digitizing the business premises  . Its worth noting credit and debit cards are NOT accepted by a large number of residents of the vast continent, but mobile is the dominant form of payment in the order of several fold. Bitsoko is Building its services around mobile money.\n\nWe intend to resolve this by allowing our merchants to sell their digital goods and services in the Metaverse thereby eliminating excessive bureaucracy and excessive red tape experienced during the business registration process experienced by many young entrepreneurs starting their entrepreneurship journey.\n\nCapturing the market potential of the Young African continent should be something Decentraland should be interested in. Not only will they visit our shops on the mataverse, they will also visit other locations on Decentraland implying  positive multiplier effects in terms of user visits and Platform adoption, I am sure they will be spending alot too.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe intend to hire more developers particularly to develop 3D models for the Metaverse. I believe we will have multiple integrations between the real world shops and those in the metaverse which can end up slowing you down.\n\nIts worth noting Bitsoko has a plot of land on Decentraland though not the desired size  check out.\nhttps://play.decentraland.org/?position=58,-125\n\nwe have also been creating content posted on our youtube, check out\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvwS_yLoa7E\n\nWithout a doubt we see the potential of the Metaverse.\nThanks to Bill and Melinda gates foundation, an angle investor does not require much from you, we have been working without any fixed deadlines on the project. This has not stopped us from seeing the project is a success, as we have partnered with other industry leaders including Solana, Algorand, wallet of satoshi, among many others still in the works.\n\nMore details about the project timeline check out our Whitepaper on our community page here.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qf9Wj53U74oqfvWDa9JO-jejzIXabAle/view\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nWe are a large group of developers but principally led by the co-founders Gibson Juma and Allan Juma more about us check out the whitepaper on our website check out.\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qf9Wj53U74oqfvWDa9JO-jejzIXabAle/view\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe hope to be able to let our users buy and sell digital products and services within 1 year after we receive the grant, thereafter we hope to be able to enable our users sell other goods from the Metaverse using interrogations with google maps and Bluetooth beacons in physical shops in the real world over the next year. thanks to our Networking department Dooca check out https://gateway.bitsoko.org/dooca.html\n\nWe hope to report on a trimester basis every 4 months but its good to note we are in a third world country and most things do not run like in a first world country. We have no issue moving elsewhere as we have done during our many visits around the continent, and we have come to like it the way it is, as it has informed our product development heavily. We are developing a service to be used in a market which we already are already part of. Be that as it may, we are very young developers with  a vision for the continent and hope to bring the project to a successful end.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5a7f2570-4931-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

I have already created six tshirts that will each cost me about $1700 USD to publish. I have already invested in designing/creating the shirts and claiming the 'MeditateOnPeace' name (I also own the meditateonpeace.com, meditateonpeace.org and @meditateonpeace). The essence of the brand will be to encourage a positive mind set. The idea came to me during a special experience two years ago and I believe Decentraland is the perfect community/place to turn the idea into reality.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n33,333 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x6e8f9e7961d30a435114ee5793614be7040f1210\n\n## Description\n\nMeditateOnPeace should receive funding to encourage the cultural development of Decentraland. The brand will encourage a positive mindset and lifestyle by getting involved in the community to provide services aligned with the brand (e.g. yoga classes, guided meditations, breath work, speakers, book club, etc...). I want MeditateOnPeace to be a brand built on positivity, open-mindedness, and community. The brand's mission is Peace & Prosperity.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nI have connected with one person online who has created the first six t-shirts. I will continue to rely on their expertise to convert my designs into wearables compatible with Decentraland.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nRight now it just me and one other person I found on the internet to help bring my (simple) designs to life.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nI have already worked with someone to create six tshirts (technically twelve: six mens, six womens) and will launch them as soon as I receive the funds.  I will also immediately begin designing and creating more clothing. Eventually it would be nice to open a store/yoga studio and getting more involved in community events aligned with our brand (e.g. guided mediations, yoga classes, breath work, etc...).\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=6030ade0-4896-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

Because of this needs, some changes while good decisions at the moment to unblock features, were not thought holistically or now they may be causing too much unneeded Data Transfer cost or have room for performance improvement for the Catalysts core processes like Bootstrapping and Synchronization.\n\nDecision\nAfter reviewing the Catalyst API we defined a set of changes to clean up and close a first clean version of the Catalyst Protocol. The changes that will be described below will enable us to:\n\n*   Reduce Data Transfer cost by only narrow down the response bodies to return needed information\n*   Reduce public API complexity by hiding endpoints that are only intended for troubleshooting, this will also reduce hits to endpoints that should not be used externally\n*   Improve the Catalyst bootstrapping and synchronization time by reducing the amount of request and information received for the synchronization\n*   Contribute to the Platform scaling and support of more concurrent users\n*   Do a more efficient uses of the DB\n*   Open the door to create new Catalyst implementation based on this protocol definition and with this, help us to create a more robust Protocol\n\nList of API changes:\n\nSecure endpoints won't be part of the Catalyst Protocol definition but we will keep them as internal troubleshooting tools, these endpoints will require a key in order to be used.

Several of us did not mind paying it because we love the support of the DCL team and also were investing in our wearable venture. We also don't mind some of the proposals to lower the fee or tie to USD or DAI to keep point of entry lower so people can also sell there wearables lower. However for of us that paid when high also deserve to be refunded the difference of the new price being lowered to if this passes.\n\nIf the price always drops every-time someone submits a new proposal ask yourself what is ever the point of paying/investing early if the price always goes down in price. Risk in early innovation will always = punished not rewarded\n\nWe don’t sell our wearables like “ ( first 5 buyers pay 500 mana) after that only $2 each!” Who the hell would wanna be first 5 buyers. Even if I was Billy Mayes himself\n\nSo our proposal is we either keep 500 mana or lower price for wearable submission and refund the difference to all paid the higher price.

It is  **ONLY IN POLYGON** where UG collections are being created.\n\nFor the time being, royalties are going to be calculated following:\n\n*   Each token is an item kind. You may know that each item can have a beneficiary which is used for primary sales. If the item has a beneficiary, the royalties will go to the item's beneficiary. If not.\n*   Royalties will go to the collection creator.\n\nThe implementation of how the royalties receiver is calculated can be easily replaced by a new one. To understand how it can be done if you are tech, refer [here](https://github.com/decentraland/marketplace-contracts/blob/feat/marketplace-with-royalties/contracts/managers/RoyaltiesManager.sol)\n\nThe royalty will be 2.5%.\n\nThe smart contracts still support the current fee for the DAO but is going to be 0%. I decided to keep it if for some reason we need to have something like 1% for the DAO and 1.5% for creators.\n\nThe Grant amount can change. I've set a cap. I'm still waiting for the auditors' quote.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe smart contracts are ready for being audited.\n\nBoth implementations are [here for the marketplace](https://github.com/decentraland/marketplace-contracts/pull/56) and [here for bids](https://github.com/decentraland/bid-contract/pull/2)\n\nThe plan is to start testing the smart contracts within the Decentraland Marketplace ASAP.  Once we can be sure that everything is working as expected and safe, launch it.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n[@Nacho](https://github.com/nachomazzara): Decentraland Evangelist\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe roadmap for adding the royalties in the Decentraland Marketplace will be:\n\n*   Audit the smart contracts\n*   Deploy them in the Mumbai testnet.\n*   Integrate the new smart contracts in the subgraphs & in the UI.\n*   Deploy in Polygon.\n*   Launch\n\nRelated to the topic for this Grant. The roadmap is just to pay for the audit of the smart contracts.\n\nFor integrating the smart contract in the Decentraland Marketplace I will require effort for the engineer team.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7b6692e0-44d7-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

It's already about 1000+ hours into development and can already make the management of your dcl events and NFT galleries as easy as maintaining a blog. Early beta tests have already begun.\n\nLand owners and land moderators (Admins) can login to the service with metamask and begin updating the content of their property in near-realtime. Admins can also add and remove additional user addresses to control the access themselves.\n\n[Please view our Video Proposal Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYtaZeF16dM)\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xc1b8662A68F3eb66bC5e5C4DE7C1EF04Dc344d53\n\n## Description\n\nIf you have some time, please watch the video proposal cited above.\n\nThis grant proposal will guarantee that every land owner will be able to use the following dclconnect features for free at launch. Please note that as time goes on, more and more features will be rolled into the free tier as well. This is simply where we start.\n\n***VideoStreams***\n\n*   Update the video stream on the fly. Control playback in near-realtime for all of the realms.\n*   Schedule video(s) to play at a specific time(s) (Throw your own festival!)\n*   Apply alpha masks, emissions and other video effects with checkboxes and dropdowns, not code\n*   Reposition and scale each with built in controls from within the browser\n*   Efficiently apply the same texture to multiple screens\n*   Attach a countdown clock to sync with when your video starts\n*   Attach audio controls so your users can adjust the volume themselves\n*   Attach pre-roll slideshows or videos to play before or after your event\n\n***NFT Galleries / Posters***\n\n*   Add any image to your property by providing a url\n*   Reposition and scale each with a built in transform control from the browser\n*   Add click events to go to external sites\n\nVisit this grant's forum discussion page to see examples of how to implement this into your existing land.\n\nA smart-item is being planned to allow any dcl builder users to use the service as well. It is on the roadmap! However, it has some unique challenges we have to overcome.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOur services require many moving parts in order to operate smoothly. The majority of the infrastructure is already in place. This includes the UI/API/WS and the CI/CD pipeline to easily deploy updates.\n\nVisit this grant's forum discussion page to see a detailed explanation of our business model. (There is a character limit in the initial proposal)\n\nWe already open source a significant amount of the tools that we create.\nPlease check our [npm package](https://github.com/pmacom/dclconnect) for an idea of our future code contributions.\n\nPlease note that the public release is still tentatively set for Q1 2022. We will roll out the public free tier version in phases.

And I know technically speaking it already is but what I am suggesting is similar to how Facebook has business pages and groups but they would be a DAO structure community page for groups, businesses, event spaces, etc. This way we could have a place for all of our DCL announcements and community without having to use an outside 2 Dimensional resource to communicate with people not in world.\n\nThe way the DAO could be set up is generate a coin with however much MANA you put in divided by the coin amount. Price of coin in this use wouldn't be the main concern because it would be primarily based on it's utility to vote in your community decisions.\n\nMore unpopular opinion: We could also make the pages only accessible to land owners.\n\n- DAO system built off of MANA for DCL Based Businesses or Non-Profits\n- DAO system built off of MANA for DCL Based Businesses or Non-Profits | Only available to land owners.\n- No MANA Mainnet but this idea is a good idea in concept so I'm not against it but I think it can be done on the ETH Mainnet\n- No MANA mainnet and no DAOs\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed7dee60-41fc-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

    "title": "Community Module Creation: Checkers",
    "body": "> by 0xc24789c6f165329290ddd3fbeac3b6842a294003\n\nShould the following Tier 1: up to $1,500 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nI am seeking funding for the development of the classic board-game 'Checkers.' This module will be made available to the community to help build a repository of functional examples to act as a starting point for new developers and provide a fun game that can be freely implemented into existing land.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n1,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003\n\n## Description\n\nDevelopers for Decentraland (DCL) a few start-points when first learning how to create scenes in DCL. New users can find some content on YouTube, read through the SDK, and even find a set of snippets that display core use-cases (animations, transactions, etc); but we currently lack a set of larger, accessible projects which can be studied. Land owners also lack an available set of easily installed scene games, which provide valuable content, without purchasing such content through development teams or external sites.\n\nThis development grant seeks to target these two problems by providing a:\n\n*   functional code-base that can be accessed by developers to further their understanding of DCL development\n\n*   playable scene preview that can be easily accessed to show new users a small portion of DCL's potential\n\n*   functional game that land owners can freely host on their land\n\nThis project is the first in a series I am planning on developing. I'm starting small, mostly board-games and old computer games, to create a start point for any new developer. However, I am aiming to implement larger projects such as tower defence and card games. By implementing these projects and providing them to the community we should be able to make things easier for new developers, stimulate land owners to develop their land with free modules, and attract new users!\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe core design factor here is ease-of-use. The program will be created using modular design and a heavy focus on implementing interfaces. This means developers will be able grasp the high-level concept of implementation (how all the pieces fit together) and how each function works  (what the individual pieces do). This also provides users a way to add this game to their scenes without needing to have an understanding of programming.\n\nCheckers will be the game that this module will be centred around. Using this module a user will be able to create any number of boards that will operate independent of one another across the hosting scene. This means a single scene could host several boards at one time, allowing for land owners to create plazas or hubs for users to play at!\n\nWhen completed, the code-base will be publicly hosted on Git so anyone interested can access/download the files. A preview scene will be hosted on Vercel, as a static webpage, so community members can view/play the game as they want. All rights to the code-base will be waived, pushing it directly into the community's ownership and allowing interested parties to do with it as they please (including hosting on their land/building upon the project/monetizing play).\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI'll be working on this project solo, its a little too small to pull any teammates in. I've been programming for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). While I've only been developing in DCL for the past quarter of a year I have made good strides and am fully capable of implementing this project in the given time-frame. I've created several projects to learn the platform and have a good understanding of the development pipe-line.\n\nOne of the projects I've implemented and polished for DCL is Minesweeper, which is currently playable \\[here!] (https://vercel-minesweeper-showcase.vercel.app/)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe current estimate for this project is two weeks. During the first week I will implement the functional code and provide a preview of the game scene. By the end of the second week I will have polished the code to maximize readability and optimized the scene to run efficiently. During this time the Git code-base will be made available and the playable preview will be hosted!\n\nThank you for your time,\nTheCryptoTrader69\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f79cfc20-41fb-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

    "title": "Integrating Decentraland with 4 other platforms",
    "body": "> by 0x18871a5a5f729b1c1f1bf62611773cc26b00c317\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nRather than see the Metaverse space dominated by one large corporation, it would be much more interesting to see a group of already successful virtual worlds join together to form a system-of-systems, a mini Metaverse. After the initial pioneering work, virtual worlds can be added to the system-of-systems, ever increasing the size of the would-be Metaverse. Several prototypes have already been created integrating disparate systems using IPSME. This proposal would enable the pioneering work to integrate Decentraland with other platforms, **without** requiring massive re-engineering efforts from Decentraland. IPSME does not require Decentraland to conform to a third-party protocol or SDK; IPSME uses Decentraland's existing infrastructure.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n48,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x18871A5a5F729b1C1F1Bf62611773cC26b00c317\n\n## Description\n\nThis proposal would enable the pioneering work to integrate Decentraland with 4 other systems. Rather than incur large re-engineering costs to have Decentraland conform to a particular Metaverse protocol, the integrations with the other systems will be created external to Decentraland's implementation via IPSME. This is contrary to the often peddled approach which requires integrated systems to adhere to and implement a particular protocol or SDK. When protocols in the integrated system of systems are updated, Decentraland is not required to update in order to keep participating in the Metaverse space. Normally, integrating 5 systems together would require an exponential `5(5-1)/2=` 10 integrations, but translations in IPSME are transitively applicable, reducing the number of integrations required to a linear `(5-1)=` 4.\n\nDecentraland can choose exactly what APIs it would like to share with the other systems, whether that be teleporting, asset sharing, profiles, etc. Components will be created that can run along side Decentraland, with Decentraland only being required to update when it wants to make use of or offer services.\n\nBy integrating with other systems, Decentraland can onboard new users and dynamically make use of services that the other platforms provide. Decentraland can also operate as a service provider for other systems as well. The entire integrated system-of-systems can develop organically.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe specification for IPSME is here: https://doi.org/10.1145/3458307.3460966\n\nAnd a simple video introduction can be found here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvoeUydcInA\\&list=PLc_eusB5Phcw8sZqLNdl3BwGqifK_HGPK\\&index=1\n\nOver the last 4 years, IPSME has been tested in several prototypes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc_eusB5Phcw8sZqLNdl3BwGqifK_HGPK\n\nThe integration of Minecraft and Doom.  https://kim.nevelsteen.com/project/metaverse-doom3-minecraft-integration/\n\nAnd, the integration of 123 third-party Minecraft servers: https://kim.nevelsteen.com/project/mim-web-of-interconnected-block-worlds/\n\n### IPSME:\n\n*   Doesn't avoid standards, but avoids the ***need*** for standards\n*   translations are external to the systems being integrated\n*   reduced costs: rather than bring down and re-engineer the system to adhere to a standard, external translations are dynamically updated instead\n*   reduced complexity: translations can be used transitivity, reducing complexity from exponential to linear\n*   each world gets to choose what they share by exposing APIs on their existing infrastructure\n*   ability to dynamically query the network for new services\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe aim of this proposal is a 6 to 12 month project. I've been working on interoperability since 1998.\n\nKim Nevelsteen Ph.D., Distributed Pervasive Applications\n\nSystem of Systems Integration / Metaverse Research Scientist, Professional Software Developer\n\nhttps://kim.nevelsteen.com\n\nhttps://twitter.com/nev23\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/nevelsteen23\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nDue to the created prototypes, lots of code has already been written for the IPSME components. After the rudimentary infrastructure is ready, integration will start with two virtual worlds. If this proposal is granted, Decentraland will be the first to be integrated. Thereafter, the other integrations will be made until all virtual worlds form the system-of-systems.\n\nAs visible on my YouTube channel, I regularly release videos on the progress of my work. This grant is not for a prototype, but for releases. Also, if all goes well, the Decentraland community should be able to enjoy extra functionality (towards the end of the project).\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=47e1bb80-4139-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

This grant proposal builds on the previously 'passed' poll to bring it to fruition.\n\nCurrently, the DAO Committee does not have a tool to calculate royalties due to each creator and the DAO dApps team is still in the planning and hiring phase. The royalty fees due to creators currently reside in the DAO committee wallet and should be redistributed to creators when the accounts payable is calculated.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe64581f067cfdce58657e3c0f58175e638c30f2b\n\n## Description\n\nThe scope of this project is the development of a tool that allows the user to view all primary and secondary sales per item, per collection. \"Primary sales\" are indicated by the consumer minting the wearable through the store contract, and originates from the null address. “Secondary sales” are sales that have occurred on the Decentraland Marketplace, either via direct listing from the creator or listing by a consumer.\n\nAny user is able to access the dApp and view data by either Wearable Creator, Wearable Collection, or Wearable Item. Data is presented in an intuitive way such that selecting an item, collection, or creator results in a table with a complete list of all primary and  secondary sales and some basic analytics about the market of that selection.\n\nThe transaction table is viewable within the app and downloadable by a user in CSV format for submission to the wearables committee.\n\nThe transaction table of primary and secondary sales transactions includes the following information:\n\n*   Name of the wearable, collection, and creator\n*   Date and time the transaction occurred\n*   Addresses of the buyer and seller (or ENS address if applicable)\n*   Transaction amount and currency\n*   The transaction hash, with link to [Polyscan](https://polygonscan.com/)\n*   The 2.5% royalty calculation for the transaction\n\nMarket Analytics:\n\n*   Weekly sales comparison, primary and secondary\n*   Graph of cumulative primary sales over time, by item and Mana\n*   Graph of secondary sales, including number of items sold, average price, and volume\n\nAdditional market analytics may be added as a result of discovery sessions with wearables creators.\n\nThis application will be hosted on IPFS. We will purchase a domain, register it for 3 years, and forward it to IPFS as a convenience to users.\n\nThe application will be made open source using an MIT license and the git repo will be made public, allowing users to run the dApp locally.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe dApp will make use of the following technologies:\n\n*   Angular\n*   Angular Material\n*   Bootstrap\n*   IPFS\n*   The Graph\n*   Decentraland Catalyst Server\n*   Ethereum Naming Service\n\nThe preliminary work towards this goal surrounds the inspection of the current subgraph implementation for L2 wearables indexing. First, to confirm whats needed to extract the data from the subgraph in its current implementation. Second, to understand if there is significant value to be unlocked for the wearables creators as to justify the development of this tool for its immediate and future use, subsequently resulting in the submission, and resubmission, of this proposal.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nDevelopment will be led by howieDoin.dcl.eth and MorrisMustang.dcl.eth from Atlas Corporation.\n\nhowieDoin and MorrisMustang joined the Decentraland community in February this year. Their primary focuses are gathering data and creating analytics for the Decentraland ecosystem. You can check out some public examples at [Decentralandalytics App](https://app.decentralandalytics.com).\n\nOver the course of the year, the team has realized how important some of this data is to the community at large and this grant proposal is one of our efforts towards democratizing access.\n\nDisclosures: Atlas Corporation has not created any wearables to date and will not experience a material gain from the existence of this tool, outside of the grant funds allocated for development.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nDevelopment Sprint 1:\n\n*   Locate the data\n*   Program the extraction of the data\n*   Aggregate and transpose the data into its consumable form\n*   Conduct discovery interviews with prominent wearable creators to arrive at user stories which will inform the design of the front end dApp.\n\nDevelopment Sprint 2:\n\n*   Design and implement user interface to retrieve and render the primary and secondary sales data\n*   Publish dApp to IPFS and route DNS\n*   Publish git repo with local deployment instructions\n\nProgress updates will be published to the DAO channel in Discord.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=97eeea20-40b8-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

This is an opportunity to support the infrastructure that millions of content creators use for creating, optimizing, and converting avatars and worlds.\n\nIn my opinion it is also a powerful PR move for the crypto industry to make regarding the open metaverse, similar to how mainstream cultural icons are buying and changing their pfps to NFTs. The Decentraland logo can sit above Steam (which recently banned crypto) and Google (which centralized much of the web).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n175,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x9De8991C56F622175274fb358f981AF6F903a799\n\n## Description\n\nThis proposal is partly inspired by this great post, \"We Need More Open Source in Gaming\": https://a16z.com/2016/06/01/open-source-gaming-vr/\n\n\"A rising tide lifts all boats.\"\n\nBlender is an open source 3D content-creation program that lays at the center of 3D workflows like an indispensible swiss army knife tool. Its used by millions of people - in 2020 alone there were 14M downloads. The subreddit has almost 500k members and there have been over 100 books published covering Blender.\n\nAs a creator that's made virtual worlds and avatars across dozens of platforms (including Decentraland) I've used Blender for:\n\n*   creating, fixing, and optimizing 3D models and avatars\n*   converting between different 3D file formats (great glTF support)\n    *   20k meebits were made into usable avatar files using Blender\n*   High quality renders, lightmapping, and animations\n*   Exporting content directly to web based virual worlds\n\nFeatures include 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, raster graphics editing, rigging and skinning, fluid and smoke simulation, particle simulation, soft body simulation, sculpting, animating, match moving, rendering, motion graphics, video editing, and compositing.\n\nOne of the foundation's goals is \"to give the worldwide Internet community access to 3D technology in general, with Blender as a core\".\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_Foundation\n\nBlender is GPL licensed, ensuring that the code will be free as a public good for all time. It protects the developer and user community from malicious patents, hostile forks, lock-down attempts, bait-and-switch-to-closed. Other software that is GPL licensed include the Linux kernel and wordpress. [Learn more](https://www.blender.org/about/license/)\n\nIt'll be iconic for Decentraland to be the first crypto-native project to be a sponsor and have its logo displayed here next to tech giants like Google, Facebook, Apple, Unity, Epic, Nvidia, Steam, Microsoft, etc: https://i.imgur.com/oK3sIrw.png\n\nCosts for corporate gold (based on 11/3 MANA price of $2.88):\n\n\\~12,100 MANA per year\n\\~60.5k MANA for 5 years\n\nIt's ~ <1% of the MANA released (https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac), a small cost to send a large industry message about where we stand on software freedom and the open metaverse. I think it's a smart PR move, like how Visa bought a Cryptopunk.\n\nBlender currently employs 26 full time employees, and 12 freelancers remotely. Unity has over 5000. We need more open source in gaming.\n\nLink: https://fund.blender.org/\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis is a one time donation to Blender fund which in return will get the Decentraland Logo next to the likes of Google, Steam, Adobe, Microsoft, Activision, etc. I'll continue to advocate for public goods funding across the twittersphere to help ensure an open metaverse ecosystem thrives over the next decade.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nBlender Foundation info:\n\n*   https://fund.blender.org/about/\n*   https://www.blender.org/about/people/\n*   https://www.blender.org/about/foundation/\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nBlender Foundation will actively reach out to Corporate members to discuss the bi-annual planning for grants and review past supported projects.\n\nhttps://fund.blender.org/corporate-memberships/\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7890f630-3ceb-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

    "body": "> by 0xb9c4fd82a47df3b5864266a293a3516d484590b9 (Vulpixie#90b9)\n\n**Summary**\nThis is a proposal to adjust the current wearable publication fee in light of the increase in value of MANA.\n\n**Overview**\nA wearable publication fee is important to disincentivize spam, promote high-quality wearables submissions, and compensate the members of the Curation Committee, among other things.\n\nWith the sudden rise in value of MANA, and the general volatility of the crypto market, a flat MANA fee can price both current and up-and-coming creators out of the marketplace.\n\nInstead of a flat MANA fee, the fee should be based on MANA’s current fiat value.\nWhen MANA was $1 USD or lower a 500 MANA fee per item was reasonable. However with MANA currently over $2 USD, paying 500 MANA upfront to submit a design is not possible for many creators.\n\nBy maintaining the 500 MANA fee the Wearables Editor becomes available only to established creators and others with deep pockets and excludes young and newer creators who cannot afford $1000 USD or more to submit a wearable.\n\n**Limitations**\nHaving the wearable publication fee tied directly to fiat value would be complicated as value can change by a few pennies on any given day. Not only would this create a need for fractional MANA transactions, but it could have the unintended consequence of creators waiting for some ideal price to submit their designs.\n\n**The solution is to have a fee with a set value that is adjusted weekly.**\nAt a set time once per week, the wearable publication fee would be set based on the current USD fiat value of the token, so that the fee is approximately $500 USD rounded to the nearest whole MANA.\n\nThis would eliminate the need for fractional MANA transactions and would keep the value of the fee relatively constant. Any dramatic change in value is corrected by the next week, allowing the fee to remain relatively constant regardless of changes in the value of MANA.\n\n**Proposal**\nThis serves as a proposal to once weekly adjust the wearable publication fee so that the fiat value is approximately equivalent to $500 USD, rounded to the nearest whole MANA instead of a flat MANA fee. The Curation Committee’s compensation would be proportionally adjusted to remain at 10% of the fee.\n\n- Adjust the Wearable Publication Fee on a Weekly Basis to Reflect an Approximate Fiat Value\n- Adjust the Wearable Publication Fee at a Different Frequency to reflect an Approximate Fiat Value\n- Leave the Wearable Publication Fee at 500 MANA\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e73b1d20-3a6d-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

We are a virtual reality (VR) start-up in the medtech space, developing healthcare service offerings for the metaverse (www.visre.co). We were invited to present our solution at an upcoming medical conference called the Primary Care Grand Conference 2021 that focuses on innovations in health and wellness (URL: https://www.askdr.co/pcgc21-nov).\n\nWe request for funding to officially secure a feature of Decentraland at this conference and officially acknowledge its support, in order to screen its promotional videos. We hope the DAO agrees on the value of this opportunity for visibility to this specialised audience that could value-add to our metaverse experience in decentraland, and we hope to seek your support!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n2,800 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x006d559fc29090589d02fB71d4142aa58b030013\n\n## Description\n\nThe upcoming medical conference is called the Primary Care Grand Conference 2021 that focuses on innovations in digital health and wellness for which we have been invited to present our solution. This targets interested healthcare practitioners and innovators in the medtech space, with over 100 doctors pre-registered to date.\n\nWe requested to feature $MANA and Decentraland promotional videos in our presentation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HmXrOTEmxg). However, as the feature of Decentraland in our presentation constitutes an \"advertisement\" we need to obtain an official sponsor status for Decentraland for us to go proceed. Other protocols that have similarly funded the conference and secured official sponsorship include Ocean Protocol ($OCEAN) featured in the conference portal accordingly: https://www.askdr.co/pcgc21-nov\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe requested to include Decentraland promotional videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6DUV19Ri\\_8) in our presentation due to our goal to offer our solution in the Decentraland Metaverse in future, after we complete our ongoing clinical validation studies.\n\nAn earlier user acceptance study by our partner doctors has been published is freely available for viewing and download at this link:  https://innovations.bmj.com/content/7/2/278\n\nOur free preview augmented reality (AR) mobile applications used in that study which educate about eye health and the importance of eye screening are also freely available on the app stores:\n\n*   apple:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eyecu/id1377613953\n*   android:\\\n    https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.visre.eyecufinal\\&hl=en_SG\\&gl=US\n\nOther than describing our solution, our intended presentation also introduces the professional audience to the concept of the metaverse and non-fungible tokens, as well as features Decentraland as the leading metaverse platform with an active community and track record of high profile events including the recent metaverse festival (https://themetaversefestival.io/).\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nOur team from VISRE will be working on this project, including our full-time lead software developer and chief technology officer (CTO) Wong Kang-An who will be presenting the solution and about Decentraland. He will be supported by the clinical lead Dr. Dinesh Gunasekeran in sharing about the clinical relevance of these applications.  \n\nFurther information about our backgrounds available at these links here:\n\n*   Wong Kang-An: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kang-an-wong-18b429119/\n*   Dr. Dinesh: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dineshvg\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe conference is upcoming on 20 November 2021 - we have already sought pre-approval from the conference organiser, and would be allowed to incorporate this feature of Decentraland as soon as the community votes in support (if of course, you decide to vote for us). We hope you agree on the potential value of potentially drawing these clinicians to have a presence and value-add in our Decentraland metaverse. Thank you for reading our application!\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e8443b70-3a3b-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

    "body": "> by 0x3fb38cee8d0ba7dcf59403a8c397626dc9c7a13b (MorrisMustang)\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe DAO has voted to redirect the 2.5% royalty fees from wearables sales away from the DAO and to the creators of the wearables. Currently, the DAO Committee does not know the royalties due to each creator and the DAO dApps team is not yet in place to create such a tool.  These fees currently reside in the DAO committee wallet and could be distributed to creators if the accounts payable were known.\n\nAtlas Corporation proposes to develop open source dApp which can be used to determine the total amount of secondary sales for each L2 wearable, wearable collection, and creator, and therefore the royalty fees due from the DAO to each creator.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe64581f067cfdce58657e3c0f58175e638c30f2b\n\n## Description\n\nThe scope of this project is the development of a tool that allows the user to view the number of secondary sales per item, per collection. “Secondary sales” are sales that have occurred on the Decentraland Marketplace.\n\nAny user will be able to access the dApp and view data by either Wearable Collection, Wearable Creator, or Wearable Item.  Data will be presented in an intuitive way such that selecting an item, collection, or creator results in the generation of a table with a list of all secondary sales related to that choice. This table will be viewable within the app and  downloadable by a user in CSV format.\n\nThe list of secondary sales transactions will include the following information:\n\n*   The name of the wearable, collection, and creator\n*   Date and time the transaction occurred\n*   Addresses of the buy and seller (or ENS address if applicable)\n*   Transaction amount and currency\n*   The transaction hash\n*   The 2.5% royalty fee for the transaction\n\nGiven that this is to be built as a decentralized application (“dApp”), it can be hosted on IPFS to avoid the need for recurring hosting costs.  We will purchase a domain, register it for 3 years, and forward it to IPFS as a convenience to users.\n\nThe application will be made open source using an MIT license and the git repo will be made public.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe dApp will make use of the following technologies:\n\n*   Angular/React\n*   Bootstrap\n*   IPFS\n*   The Graph\n*   Opensea API\n*   Decentraland Catalyst Server\n*   Ethereum Naming Service\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe wearables royalty calculator will require web3 data mining as well as an intuitive user interface for DAO committee members, wearables creators, and DCL community members to interact with the tool. Atlas Corporation, well versed in this data, analytics and where to find it, is best suited to undertake this challenge.\n\nDevelopment will be led by howieDoin.dcl.eth and MorrisMustang.dcl.eth.\n\nDisclosures:\nAtlas Corporation has not created any wearables to date and will not experience a material gain from the existence of this tool.\n\nIf you are a front-end developer (react, angular) and would like to participate in this project, [reach out to Atlas Corp in our discord](https://discord.com/invite/zWY6g9vc7g)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nDevelopment Sprint 1\n\n*   Locate the data\n*   Program the extraction of the data\n*   Aggregate and transpose the data into its consumable form\n*   Conduct interviews with prominent wearable creators to arrive at user stories which will inform the design of the front end dApp.\n\nDevelopment Sprint 2\n\n*   Design and implement user interface to retrieve and render the data\n*   Publish dApp to IPFS and route DNS\n*   Publish git repo with deployment instructions\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=761d9710-38cb-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**",

These things include Player Vs. Player (Bankroll)—to allow 24 hour games to run, skilled-based games only—to give users full control and an exchange-like UI—for setting stop losses (auto-payouts). More features include a 'Kaiji' inspired NFT card game, where users can use their liquidity knowledge as their high-skill component. Preview a card here: https://bit.ly/3B8Cjek.

You can create a game and choose your\nchoice. If you join a game and for example you choose rock. Once you have chosen your bet, you place it and find out the outcome.\n\nBrain Game—\nBrain Game questions set to test your knowledge against other users. This mode allows you to set a high score which you want others to beat. When playing against this bet, your bet is then placed and you have to attempt the questions. If you are able to beat the high score then you take the pot.\n\nSpleesh—\nNumber guessing game with a growing pot. Aimed for long-term holds. Plenty of mind games involved when users Join as they go for cheaper guesses you could sweep them by choosing a higher, more expensive number. Don’t risk leaving your money in too long as they will eventually guess it! So be sure to set auto-payouts.\n\nMystery Box—\nA new and improved Deal or No Deal. Pick the right box and you could win up to 50x your buy-in. Massive gains to be made from this game. If you are to guess incorrectly then\nyour amount is added to the bankroll for the bet.\n\nQuick Shoot—\nQuick shoot allows the user to pick where to save the goal by allowing the user to pick a pinpoint on the goal. The user creates a game. Other users then try to score and pay the fee to attempt the shot to win the prize sum.\n\nStratosphere (coming soon!)—\nThe first PvP Crash site with permission from Daniel @Bustabit!\n\nDrop Game (coming soon!)—\nBet NFTs value against another's, the rarer your NFT, the higher chance you have of winning.\n\nRestricted RPS (coming soon!)—\nRPS w/ NFTs (different odds)\n\nThe Royal Boycott (coming soon!)—\nHorse racing, mint your own NFT Horses and stake them to earn rewards and improve on their value.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Final Requirements to go LIVE**\nRPSBET.IO\nLeaderboards to work with $RPS\nFix ‘Join Game’ pages\nHide other gamemodes (or fix them)\nWrite smart contracts for ‘Freeplay’ & Fixed (almost the same)\nSmart contracts for converting community tax into $DG tokens\nUser Player Profiles to work with $RPS\nUpdate all automatic messages & game Logs to work with $RPS\nTestnet Launch\nMainnet Launch RPSBET.IO\nOf course we're going to need UI components and animations for the new Decentraland API so this needs to be considered.\n\n**$RPS Protocol Summary**\nWhen HOST clicks ‘Place Bet’ they will sign their transaction in Metamask.\nBets are pre-determined, so need to hash user’s choice (e.g. rock, paper or scissors)\nHOST’s $RPS will be stored in an escrow address and will automatically send XX Amount of $RPS when PLAYER Joins & Wins\nELSE IF PLAYER Loses against HOST, their $RPS is sent to the escrow.\nWhen HOST ENDs their BET, $RPS is released from the escrow address and sent to HOST.\n\nOR\n\nWe can just use React.Js/Node.Js to handle who Wins/Loses.\n\n***\n\n**PSEUDO CODE (For ‘FIXED RPS’—*Please don't judge me on my Psuedo code!*)**\n\nCreate_Game_Fixed_RPS.sol\n\nGame = Array {\ngameID = auto_generated code\nescrowAmount = $rps\npublic Address = random or set Addresss?\nisGameOpen = bool\nBets.json: { keccak256\\_hash(choice) + Bet Amount + isIndexOpen }\n}\n\nCreateGame() {\nHide/Hash Choice e.g. rock | paper | scissors\nTransfer $rps Amount from Host’s wallet to Escrow Address e.g. 0x7B429E1a7b6Dd855Df95AE7b5C8C86C7e0fAC83A\n(timestamp) + gameID stored in block\n(generate prvt key?)\n\n}\n\nJoin_Game_Fixed_RPS.sol\n\nisIndexOpen = bool\nisLastGame = bool\nYes = True\nNo = Fale\nWaiting = (True, await(5s))\n\ncalcFees(once | twice + Amount) {\nIF\tOnce = amount \\* 0.96\nELSE  Twice = amount \\* 0.9216\n}\n\nisGameOpen() {\ngetGameID\nIF isGameOpen(True) {\nReturn Yes\n}\n}\n\nisLastGame() {\nCheckIndex(game)\nIF no_more_indexes_are_open -> isGameOpen = FALSE\n}\n\nexecuteWinnings(game) {\nDecode_Hash_At_Index_Being_Requested\nIF W -> TransferFromEscrow(calcFees(Bet_Amount \\* 2)) to Joiner’s Wallet\nELSE L -> *do nothing*\nisIndexOpen(gameID, getIndex) {\nReturn False\n}\n}\n\nJoinGame() {\nGET block for selected gameID\nIF isGameOpen(yes|no|waiting) {\nTransfer $rps Amount from Joiner’s wallet to Escrow Address e.g. 0xD44304DA48f234eb63a49e1Ae3A8ACdA3a71a25a\nisIndexOpen = False\nisLastGame()\nexecuteWinnings()\n}\n\n}\n\nEnd_Game_Fixed_RPS.sol\n\nEndGame(game) {\nGet Host’s Prvt Key\nIF isGameOpen(yes) {\nisGameOpen = False\n}\nTransfer escrowAmount to Joiner’s Wallet\n}\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nHi, So I’m Lenny, CEO of RPSBET.

We have been documenting and sharing our creative process through making tutorials and videos for over a year. The progress and speed of our community development from a one parcel gallery to a three-land complex art and education estate have delightfully surprised all of us involved! See the first video here https://youtu.be/e5FCb4hYqPg and the most recent here https://youtu.be/7ev7q4qzMp8\n\nOur community includes multi-talented people from around the world who are all about having FUN while contributing their expertise toward developing the exciting possibilities in Decentraland.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x0D9F54bFF55E0B06cF517239543A4113Bd207e6C\n\n## Description\n\nOnboarding to DCL can be a daunting process to many people. Assistance through community is needed because learning and support are required to fully engage in all the delightful, beneficial activities the virtual world provides. Our group is building trust and awareness about Decentraland through social media channels, event promotions, and education. It is our experience that documenting our creative process and making video tutorials is helping to make onboarding easier and build community in DCL.\n\nIn addition to tutorials, we are networking. We have successfully used applications, giveaways and events to reach new artists, collectors, and crypto users who have entered and utilized the benefits of Decentraland.\n\nWe have submissions from 18 countries in our gallery. They are, in order of number of entries: United States, Canada, France, United Kingdom, India, Denmark, Venezuela, Turkey, Lebanon, Japan, Romania, Philippines, Malaysia, Nepal, Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, Italy.\nWe host recurring weekly events in Decentraland, such as Mermaid Tarot Readings and Heros and Dragons game.\nWe have a global music event coming in October ‘21 featuring DJ’s from around the world, NFT and POAP giveaways, and participatory modules.\nWe have events planned with our cryptocurrency partners such as Polygon, Shiba Inu, and BAO.\n\nWe plan to continue our community-building education and entertainment efforts and have reached a point where we must scale our project in order to meet the level of interest. We must improve accessibility in order to create seamless delivery across social channels and within our complex in Decentraland. It is important that all who wish to access these offerings can do so easily and have fun while they do!\n\nWhile we're excited about the pilot results, it is also clear that to offer the content we envision will require a team committed to consistent effort, and more resources. Our goal is to keep growing the Decentraland community through ease of accessibility, education, and fun events. Having a portion of our community building costs reimbursed from the new DAO grant program would enable us to scale our project.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe have created a flowchart to help onboard people, one step at a time, starting with introducing them to Decentraland first. You can see the flowchart here: https://foreverbird.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/screen_shot\\_2021-05-19\\_at\\_2.31.35\\_pm.png\n\nWe are using an app to help get feedback on what is of interest to the greater social media community.

    "title": "Streaming inside Decentraland has too much latency. Let's change the protocol and open new doors.",
    "body": "> by 0x1e09a216b70d46229f3fe86d3ad2e47ae01f7989 (Tobik)\n\nHello, everyone. Today I want to talk about a thing that is stopping the progress of Decentraland events. This thing is latency on streams.\n\nWhat I mean is that every time someone tries to stream inside a screen there are many seconds between the real world and what the screen shows. Inside DCL, it's usually about 20seconds or more depending on the server and where is the player located.\n\nI have seen that this thing makes events less enjoyable. For example, if there is a streamer and you talk in the chat of DCL, you need to wait a lot until that person responds/interacts with you.\n\nIn this sense, events that depend on streaming are very slow. Most of the players will end up following the stream via Twitch or YouTube (if the event manager is also streaming there) and it kills the experience.\n\nRight now, I want to make new events with cool ideas but those events depend on streaming and it's quite impossible to do it with 20+ seconds of delay (most of the time is 40seconds).\n\nI think this problem exists because of HLS which is the protocol Decentraland uses. From what I have seen, it is good in terms of compatibility but latency sucks. There are other options available such as WebRTC, RTMP and more. I don't know what could work with DCL but I think we need to change this. Streaming is very important and streams make events better and open new doors.\n\nPlease open the forum post that references this proposal so we all have a nice and polite discussion.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nP.S: with better latency, we could make epic streams with games, karaokes and a bunch of stuff! Think it (: !\n\n- Let's change the protocol\n- There is no need to change it\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0627a110-2fd6-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)**",

    "body": "> by 0xa0d258e7895096f813dacdaa4cdc5bf4fddd4847 (TanjaV#4847)\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nFlowershop is an Ultramono LABS embassy, for hosting our gallery, concert, and performance events. Ultramono organises events dedicated to progressive, futuristic, fusion art and  electronic  dance music, digital permaculture, inspiring conversations, and presents a gallery and clubbing events. Events are online and live, with documentation and exhibitions that can be accessed later, and usually with multiple participants collaborating in real time.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xa0d258e7895096f813dacdaa4cdc5bf4fddd4847\n\n## Description\n\nFlowershop is a cross between a gallery, club and a concept store. The idea of the flower shop that is so much more than the ordinary flower store comes from the cult Italian comic book Alan Ford by Bax Munker and Magnus. Flowershop is run by Ultramono, an art laboratory for the production of cybernetic art. Founded by Tanja Vujinovic (www.tanjav.art), new media artist with more than 25 years of experience in production and execution of multimedia events, Flowershop is going to be a new location and  continuation of Ultramono events organized across the Metaverse, that were recently held among other platforms also on VRChat and Sansar. It is envisioned as an online venue for live cyber exhibitions, performances and other events to showcase the work of artists and scientists before an international audience that will innovatively involve blockchain platform to support both community at large and participants. Using poaps, tickets, wearables, works of art, and creating workplaces, Flowershop will expand the ecosystem of the emerging new economy in art production within Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nProject will be executed in stages, first being the actual building of the venue. Models of the building already exist, so this is going to be a process of optimization and adjusting the initial sketch so it can be fully functional on Decentraland platform. After the initial stage of building and setting up the base, we will start with developing individual modules and governance of the Flowershop, and work on a multiyear programme of exhibition, party, and conversations programme, and define curated and conceptualized exhibitions. We plan to have up to ten curated collective and individual exhibition per year, and monthly talks and party events, with spontaneous events as well. We are going to use this grant to hire stuff for curation and organization, get help in building and optimization, promote and network not just on the Internet but also using real life media outlets like for example Flash Art, and try to get in touch with art bloggers. Most important aspect of the whole Part of the grant will be used to get the land for the venue. Flowershop concept is the idea of self sustainability, so extra special attention will be devoted to having help with facilitating the financial management of the space so both the programme will continue and all involved could receive compensation for their contribution to the programme.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nUltramono is founded by a new media artist Tanja Vujinovic (https://www.tanjav.art/) who has produced and participated in hundreds of IRL and online events in the field of arts and culture. As a highly experienced world builder, an artist , PhD holder in the field of Media arts and philosophy but also curator and event manager, she has presented her works on numerous festivals, in galleries and museum across the world, and recently Metaverse.  The whole team and the structure of the Ultramono LABS is visible on our Discord server: https://discord.gg/dqVXsRr\nBesides already existing team members, we plan to hire few more people who are \"natives\" in Decentraland, mostly for consultations and to initially help facilitate community aspect of the space and establish good monetary practices for all involved and our future audience.\nFlowershop is the latest iteration that spawn from our success in organizing events in VRChat and Sansar, with the idea of making our permanent base in Decentraland and securing our financial sustainability across the Metaverse by making Decentraland our permanent and central home base.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nProgress will be reported on a weekly bases in writing and on our Flowershop community meetup every Saturday at 21:00 CET at our location, in front of everyone interested to hear about the development. Execution of all tasks described in the project proposal will start immediately as our initial funding is secured. Project is expected to be fully executed within three months, with our first public event expected to happen in January 2021. In the meantime, we are starting our with promotion campaign of the whole Flowershop as a cross between a gallery, a club and a concept store on all social media and within our already existing networks, so we could get as much support as possible.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=84c9c400-2dc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)**",

    "title": "Representing third-party NFTs as wearables in Decentraland",
    "body": "> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)\n\n**Summary**\n\nA proposed implementation for the submission, approval, and in-world representation of third-party NFTs as wearables.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nOne ideal of metaverses is interoperability. Web3 has given people more agency over their digital identities and the assets they own, but as more people purchase art from NFT projects like [BAYC](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) and [CCC](https://cryptocannabisclub.com/), there is an increasing desire to bring these assets into other corners of the metaverse. In short, people want the ability to don their NFTs as wearables when strolling through Decentraland.\n\nThe following solution would require third-parties (i.e. original creators of an NFT project) to apply to the DAO to be “registered” within Decentraland. Approved third parties would be added to a Third Party Registry (TPR): a smart contract deployed to Polygon.\n\nThird-parties would then be able to upload the 3D assets needed to represent their NFTs in Decentraland. Items should still be vetted by the Wearables Curtation Committee. All approved items would then be logged in the TPR with a unique identifier (URN).\n\nThis solution requires some work from the third parties. Each would have to build a “resolver” mapping their NFTs to the corresponding items in the TPR. This resolver would need to expose a standardized API endpoint that a Decentraland client could call whenever a player opens their backpack.\n\nThe mapping between NFTs and item URNs is up to the third party. For example, since the resolver is built by the third party, the response to the Decentraland client could be customized to return one URN for an NFT, or one URN for multiple NFTs.\n\n**These third-party representations of \"source\" NFTs would be different from current Decentraland wearables:**\n\n*   The publication fees should vary depending on the size of the collection.\n*   It would be impossible for these representations to be exchanged (in either a primary or secondary sale) in *any* marketplace *independently* from the source NFT. These new items are only 3D representations of the source NFT, and do not have their own corresponding token that can be traded.\n\n**Specification**\n\nFirst, some quick definitions:\n\n**Third Party**\n\nThe original creator of the external NFT.\n\n**Source NFT**\n\nA specific NFT within a collection of external NFTs made by a third party. For example: CryptoKitties, Apes from BAYC, etc.\n\n**Item**\n\nThe asset, or in-world representation, for a source NFT. These are identified in the TPR by a unique identifier (URN).\n\n**Collection**\n\nA collection of items that all belong to the same theme of NFTs. (e.g. apes from BAYC)\n\n**Item Slot**\n\nOne of a limited number of potential representations that Third Parties may use. Item slots are bought in tiers for MANA.\n\n**Third Party Registry (TPR)**\n\nThe smart contract deployed to Polygon that stores the list of approved third parties and the items that represent their NFTs.\n\n**Third Party Resolver**\n\nAn API built by a third party that allows clients to verify which source NFTs are owned by the player and which item representations correspond with those NFTs that can be rendered in-world.\n\n**Process overview**\n\n**Application phase**\n\nThird-party NFT projects propose the addition of a collection to the Decentraland DAO. These DAO proposals should have their own category within the governance dApp, and they should have a minimum threshold of 1M VP voting in favor (similar to grants) needed to pass.\n\n**A voting period**\n\nDAO members should be able to vote on whether or not to include the new third-party collection. The voting period should last 1 week, like other proposal categories.\n\n**Collection registration**\n\nApproved collections are added to the TPR deployed to Polygon. This is done by the DAO Committee.\n\n**Collection management**\n\nAfter a collection is approved by the DAO and registered in the TPR, the third-party may add, edit, and manage items within the collection. All of this management will be done via a new UI exposed in the Builder available to approved third parties.\n\n**Purchasing item slots**\n\nPart of the collection management stage is the process of buying item slots for a collection. These slots can be purchased in batches in exchange for MANA.\n\nThe size of the batches and price function should be determined in a separate proposal.\n\n**Item approval**\n\nLike all wearables, items must be reviewed and approved by the Wearables Curation Committee. Items must be “locked” by the third-party before they can be approved by the curation committee. As collections of third party NFTs might include thousands of items, members of the curators committee should be permitted to sample specific items before approving items in batches. It would be unrealistic to review items individually.\n\n**Item registration**\n\nAll items are uploaded and edited by third party managers (addresses given “manager” permissions in the Builder) before they are added to the TPR. Items added to the TPR are then reviewed by the Wearables Curation Committee.\n\n**Deployment**\n\nWearable models and textures are uploaded to the catalyst network after ensuring each URN has been added to the TPR. This results in an address check either via a subgraph or a check to the TPR contract itself.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nThird parties are responsible for developing their own API endpoint mapping their NFTs to the item URNs in the TPR. This endpoint’s shape should follow a predefined standard to avoid one-off integrations. Furthermore, the logic behind this endpoint and any interaction with other smart contracts would be outside the scope of Decentraland’s involvement. Full legal responsibility lies with the third party to ensure that they only interact with smart contracts whose IP they’re permitted to use.\n\n**For a visual overview of the collection creation, approval, deployment, and resolution flow [see this diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1znwxC35wg6kzksvqP3pCMiJ2D-DwgtF3/view?usp=sharing).**\n\n**Additional comments**\n\n*   While this implementation could support any form of asset, the first use-case is wearables for avatars based on PFP NFTs.\n*   The goal isn’t to make external NFTs compatible with Decentraland, but to create new representations within Decentraland that are linked with external NFTs.\n*   The Curation Committee is responsible only for approving *items* submitted by third parties. The DAO would approve the addition of new third parties.\n*   The Curation Committee always has the ability to reject specific items, all items within a collection, and all items from a Third Party creator should the resolver provide incorrect data, or no data at all, to the client\n*   Items won’t exist inside traditional wearable collections, won’t have rarity, and cannot be sold in primary or secondary sales. They are only in-world representations mapped to external NFTs by the TPR.\n\n**Should the suggested implementation for wearable representations of third party NFTs be developed by the Foundation?**\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)**",

    "body": "> by 0x78a6c93ce98dbdbd4ec0d1f6db17de9a6a4ae96e (NFTCreatorTours)\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nOn-board and educate creators, brands and celebrities in fashion, or any other industry indicating an interest in the Metaverse and all it has to offer. Let’s show them Decentraland and help them understand what makes it a very special place and help them create vibrant and supportive communities within the DCL landscape!  No one wants a cash grab, and I can provide a guided program of enlightenment into DCL!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x78a6C93cE98DBDBD4EC0D1f6Db17DE9a6A4Ae96E\n\n## Description\n\nINTRO: We are currently experiencing a flood of creators, brands and celebrities express interest in NFT's and all things Metaverse,  including fashion creators but also big brands and other industries.  We know many want to enter the space- I am here to ensure they are expertly guided keeping DCL community values in mind at all times with the goal of providing an amazing value-added experience for their fans and supporters as well as our beloved community.  Many do not know the first clue of how to begin and I receive messages regularly on all platforms that ask the question, can you help me??   I would like to solve this problem by providing an on-boarding experience that is easy to understand, exciting as well as tailored for them and enlightening in terms of what the community of DCL will respond to and embrace.  Let’s create a space to showcase talent, encourage collaboration with the DCL community and feature any artist who is interested in putting their work in front of these high - profile entities, whether it be a celebrity, brand or influencer.\n\nDEEPER DIVE: High-profile creators, celebrities and brands are coming, it’s just a matter of time.  I am committed to easing the friction and helping on-board high profile creators in fashion, or other industries, brands, boutiques, celebrities, you name it, while always keeping in the forefront the values and sense of community that is Decentraland.   I also want to encourage the creation of wearables for women in DCL!  And I want to encourage kids and students who are fascinated by art/fashion and design, or even architecture to have a space to communicate and collaborate with designers and artists, and to find mentors in the space.  This will generally start with a tour of the main POI in DCL, but it won’t be just a  ‘tour'.  It will be a tailored experience based upon their industry and goals; Gathering a network of our best DCL artist creators is an important step in supporting the DCL ecosystem.  Essentially, a pool of professionals who are available and who want to connect with brands and creators.  During the introductory tour, I will ensure celebrities and brands are visiting the places in DCL that will enlighten and show them what is possible, give them a sense of excitement and a sense of understanding of the myriad of possibilities and incredible value to both themselves, their dedicated fans and the DCL community.   Community is my big emphasis and I just know the excitement generated will lead to projects and benefit the ecosystem of DCL.\nI fully recognize that the NFT / Decentraland community cares deeply about creating value for the community and so do I!  Let me help onboard those that are quasi-guaranteed to step into the space with or without us, ensuring a spectacular and value-added experience for all involved!  To this end, I’d love to find a landing space in DCL to start our tours, and eventually hold mini-workshops, fashion shows, art shows, movie showings and conferences bringing creative minds together, AND to create a boutique-like experience to support and encourage collaboration between brand and our artist/creator DCL community.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nHire project coordinator(s)  - Responsibilities will include Discord moderation and communication with clients.\nHire Website Designer, Videographer\nEducate introductory tour guides\nAny left over monies will be used for the Buildout of a space in DCL if we cannot find one, OR programs that will go towards education!\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nAstrid Pilla, Here's my LinkedIn Profile! https://www.linkedin.com/in/astridpilla/\nAnd my website about page:  https://www.nftcreatortours.com/about\nI’ve conducted docent tours around the Metaverse during DCL 100xArt Week, have volunteered with NFTs.tip s both on the Admin side and as a Clubhouse Room moderator, a writing contributor to NFTS.WTF, helped with several drops and am currently helping about 8 high profile NFT projects as we speak. I have toured high profile clients (musicians, BBoys, NYPL, movie production designers) throughout DCL.  I have helped organize high profile speaker panels combining a clubhouse room, twitter space, screen share on Discord or zoom depending on clients location showing walk-though in DCL as well.   Beginner education including how to set up a Metamask and safety/security.  My favorite thing to do in my free time right now is to attend any DCL event where @category5music is playing!\nI have an intimate understanding of the wants and needs of fashion creators after having worked in the modeling industry in Paris on the business/accounting side.  And after a stint working on a team in support of the luxury group Kering and later co-creating a luxury medical practice, I understand deeply what is required to succeed in these high-end industries, AND the mindset of businesses in Europe. Plus let’s face it- DCL is a tour de force of a Metaverse!  I look forward to creating relationships with those I haven’t met already in DCL!\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nIn Phase I,  provide introductory tours and fully onboard 3-4 either creators/brands/celebrities.  Onboarding includes a drop and drop party in DCL.  That is our goal between now and March 2022.\n\nIn Phase 2: Outreach to schools in the creative arts (think Parsons School of Design) and help with introducing them to the space, providing an eventual Student Mentorship program (Phase 2 by end of May 2022)\n\nPhase 3:  If I can find a space to host us,  or if we end up being able to buy a space in DCL to create this:  A “gift shop” type of experience after our very first tour!  Featuring wearables and art we found along our tour.  (Think: high quality Museum gift shop like theMOMA).\n\n\\*\\* LATE PHASE POSSIBILITY: Conferences and/or Events planned for the benefit of our artist/technical community and a DCL Kid Creator Fashion Show of all the wearables that came into the space during this time plus our Kid Collabs!!  Get ready ladies and gentlemen, we want to show you what collaboration between kids/students and established creators can come up with !!    (Planned for Q1 of 2023)\n\nI’m so excited about the initiative and I truly hope we can receive funding to make this a reality.  I know I can provide value for all involved and for the beloved DCL community!\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=48b67630-2b78-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)**",

    "title": "Expanding the Community Grants Program",
    "body": "> by 0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc\n\n### Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to expand the range of grant tires in order to support teams and bigger scoped-projects.\n\n### Abstract\n\nDecentraland DAO opened their Community Grants program on May 31st 2021. Since then 12 grants have been given for Content Creator, Platform Contributor, Gaming and Community categories.\n\nThe current structure is aimed to single individuals:\n\n*   Tier 1: One-time payment of $500 - $1500 USD in MANA\n*   Tier 2: One-time payment of $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA\n*   Tier 3: Up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff.\n\nThis proposal aims to create 3 new tires designed for teams and larger scoped projects.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe current tires are good to fit small projects and individual contributions. If more money is needed the contributor can continue requesting further grants to keep up the good work (eg. KevinOnEarth).\n\nIn order to tackle bigger projects that require the commitment of a team for many months we need to scale our tire options. This will attract more talent to the ecosystem.\n\n### Specification\n\nThe proposed new tires are:\n\n*   Tire 4: Up to $60.000 USD using a 6 months vesting contract (1 month cliff).\n*   Tire 5: Up to $120.000 USD using a 6 months vesting contract (1 month cliff).\n*   Tire 6: Up to $240.000 USD using a 6 months vesting contract (1 month cliff).\n\nThese tires allow a team to receive up to 10k, 20k or 40k per month for over 6 months. The amounts represent the maximum requested value per tire and it opens the possibility to request less money, for example with Tire 4 one could ask for 3k USD per month over 6 months.\n\nIt’s recommended to teams to start with small tires, get idea’s validation from the community, show some progress and later request a bigger grant to suit the escalation of operations. It will be quite harder to get DAO approval for a massive grant to an unknown team.\n\nTeams should report progress to the DAO Facilitator which will be included in regular reports. The grants are provided via revocable vesting contracts, thus enabling the DAO to cut a program that doesn’t deliver what was promised.\n\n### Benefits\n\nThere are many ways the DAO benefits from the success of grants:\n\nFirst, if these grants add value to Decentraland’s ecosystem then MANA should get more general awareness and the price should go up, thus making the treasury of the DAO bigger. So what is good for Decentraland is good for the DAO.\n\nSecond, I would love to see projects capable of generating a revenue stream, becoming profitable ventures, and generating employment around Decentraland. Enabling more people to make a living out of Decentraland’s ecosystem is key.\n\nUltimately, bringing new people on board with skills and mindsets it’s a great benefit for the DAO. We need more active members. Attention and initiative are scarce resources IMHO.\n\n- Approve the inclusion of Tire 4, 5 and 6\n- Do not approve the inclusion of Tire 4, 5 and 6\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c02ff450-2783-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)**",

    "title": "Delegate the Reference Client roadmap to the Decentraland Foundation",
    "body": "> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)\n\n### Summary\n\nShould the Decentraland DAO delegate to the Foundation the responsibility of developing and executing the roadmap for the Reference Client?\n\n### Abstract\n\nThe Reference Client (the app at [play.decentraland.org](https://play.decentraland.org)) is currently the most widely used Decentraland client. Right now, the Decentraland Foundation is the main contributor to the Reference Client’s open source code base, but given the DAO’s ownership of the client (and the need to have the DAO approve major changes), the Foundation is hindered in how quickly and effectively it can develop new features and improvements.\n\nTo overcome this hurdle, the Foundation is suggesting that the DAO delegate the development and maintenance of the Reference Client to the Foundation. This delegation would be reviewed and renewed every 12 months. The Foundation would provide a roadmap to the DAO to review, provide feedback on, and approve on the same 6 month schedule to help communicate to the community the Foundation’s strategic and technical priorities.\n\nThis delegation would empower the Foundation to:\n\n*   Communicate and execute a solid roadmap both for community developers and users\n*   Build a richer feature set (e.g. better in-world navigation, social interaction, and content moderation tools)\n*   Ensure that the client is faster and more stable\n*   Improve the quality and performance of the client’s graphics\n*   Improve the client’s ability to support more concurrent users\n\n### Background\n\nTo better understand the scope of this proposed delegation and the extent of it’s impact the broader platform, it’s important to define some terms:\n\n**The “DAO”**\n\nThe DAO was created to help the community direct the development of the platform’s policies, infrastructure, content moderation, and smart contracts. The DAO owns the smart contracts for Decentraland’s digital assets (like LAND, Names, Wearables, etc.), so any changes made to those contracts must be approved by the DAO. Furthermore, platform-impacting decisions or changes to Decentraland’s codebase (i.e. decisions that impact the entire Decentraland community, like strategic decisions for the client) must be approved by the DAO.\n\n**The “Decentraland Foundation”**\n\nThe Foundation is a non-profit organization that was formed to help protect the intellectual property of the Decentraland brand (something that the DAO lacks the legal status to do). The Foundation was also tasked with supporting the decentralization of the platform alongside the community.\n\n**The “Decentraland Stack”**\n\nDecentraland is made up of a complex “stack” of different smart contracts, protocols, and applications. Together, they make up the *Decentraland Platform*. Generally speaking, the different decentralized layers can defined as:\n\n1.  The **smart contracts** that make possible Decentraland’s scarce digital assets (like land, estates, wearables, names, etc.)\n2.  The **Catalyst software** used to run the distributed network of servers that host and provide content to users.\n3.  The **software development kit** that people use to build content for the world.\n4.  **dApps like the Builder** that allow people to create and arrange content for the world without writing code.\n5.  **dApps like the Marketplace** that allow people to manage and exchange Decentraland’s digital assets.\n6.  **Clients** that allow users to interact with the content of Decentraland. Decentraland clients are like web browsers (e.g. Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox) in that they all provide access to the same network and information, but are not the web itself.\n\n**The “Reference Client”**\n\nThe Decentraland Reference Client discussed in this proposal is a web based app that allows people to access and interact with content and other people within Decentraland’s virtual world. This application sits at the top of the Decentraland Stack.\n\nIt’s helpful to remember that the Reference Client does not constitute the entire Decentraland Platform, that it is just one alternative for accessing the Decentraland Platform, that anyone can develop a customized client, and that the roadmap discussed in this proposal for the Reference Client can’t dictate changes to any other components of the platform - those must still be approved by the DAO on a case by case basis.\n\n### Specification\n\n**Duration and renewal of the delegation**\n\nThe DAO would delegate to the Foundation the responsibility of developing and maintaining the Reference Client for a period of 12 months, according to a roadmap approved by the DAO on a biannual schedule.\n\nThe Foundation would be responsible for writing each 6 month iteration of the roadmap, but each iteration must be approved by the DAO.\n\n**Ideation and validation for the roadmap**\n\nThe DAO must have a clear path to contribute ideas and requests to the roadmap. This could take the form of a new polling category within the DAO specific to client feature requests and suggestions. These proposals could then be voted on by the community, with accepted suggestions being passed to the Foundation for inclusion in the next iteration of the product roadmap.\n\n**Deviations from the roadmap**\n\nThe Foundation would be able to reasonably depart from the roadmap to make full use of the Foundation’s familiarity with the competitive market, Decentraland’s user base, and regulatory requirements, but these departures must be later approved by the DAO as part of the biannual schedule.\n\n**Funding development**\n\nFunds to develop the Reference Client (e.g. payroll for developers) would still be provided by the Foundation, not the DAO.\n\n**Termination of the delegation**\n\nThe DAO may choose at any time to revoke this delegation in favor of giving it to another entity.\n\n**Limits of the delegation**\n\nThe delegation is limited to the Reference Client and does not allow the Foundation to make changes to other areas of the Decentraland platform (e.g. changes to the Marketplace’s smart contracts); any such changes must pass through a vote in the DAO.\n\n### Rationale\n\n1.  The Reference Client is a complex application that is relevant to the continued  development of the platform.\n2.  The development life cycle for something as complex as the client requires countless technical and strategic decisions to be made on a daily basis\n3.  Given the time it takes to write proposals and pass them through the DAO, it would be extremely impractical to have the DAO weigh in on each of these decisions\n4.  So, it’s clear that in order to develop the client at a speed sufficient to compete with other metaverse projects, *at least some level of formal delegation* is needed\n5.  The Foundation is the best candidate to receive this delegation given its proximity to the platform, its resources, and its knowledge of the market and the Decentraland community\n6.  The suggested delegation would provide the Foundation with the autonomy needed to execute quickly, while still being subject to the relevant decisions, directions, and control of the DAO\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0e2d7320-260e-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)**",

    "body": "> by 0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc\n\n### Summary\n\nHire a team to maintain and improve the Governance App and develop new tools.\n\n### Abstract\n\nThe DAO is the beneficiary of a 10-year  [vesting contract](https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac)  for a total of 222M of MANA, that is *1.8 million MANA vested per month*. This has been mentioned  [in the docs](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/the-dao-fund/)  and  [in the blog](https://decentraland.org/blog/platform/community-funding/)  before, but many may not be aware of it.\n\nThe DAO has a lot of resources and a thriving community but lacks executing power. We need to invest more money and time in building infrastructure for Decentraland’s DAO.\n\nAt the moment the DAO has 4 teams:\n\n*   Security Advisory Board: 5 people to address security risk.\n*   DAO Committee: 3 people to enact proposals on-chain.\n*   DAO Facilitator: 1 person to produce reports and organize meets.\n*   Wearable Curation Committee: 3 people to review applications.\n\nThis proposal aims to create a new team with the mission of developing new software.\n\n### Motivation\n\nAt the moment the DAO is supporting contributions in the form of grants aimed to individual contributors. As an open-source project we rely on external contributors, being The Foundation the most active contributor.\n\nThe Foundation team has ~45 people working under their wing, they have been doing an amazing job and brought us a great decentralized platform and a world explorer to enjoy it.\n\nBut in order to accomplish the wider goal of becoming a more capable and powerful DAO, we need to take action. We need to onboard new contributors to help build Decentraland’s ecosystem. We need to create our own teams capable of executing the vision of the DAO.\n\nWe can start by speeding the development of our Governance dApp. This app is a critical piece of software for the DAO and it needs to be well maintained. It's also a small project in terms of scope, which makes it a great place to start.\n\n### Specification\n\nA team of highly capable full-time contributors will be assembled, filling the primary roles of Team Lead, Product Manager, Technical Writer, Web Designer, Solidity and, frontend dev.\n\nThe main scope of this team will be:\n\n*   Become core maintainers of the Governance dApp.\n*   Automate key processes of DAO’s operations.\n*   Research proposals in order to enrich conversations.\n*   Build new dApps to support community use-cases.\n\nThe DAO will set a budget and formally delegate the Governance dApp to the team. The team will be free to work on ideas that make the conversation in the governance more fruitful. The team will report their progress and consult their roadmap with the community.\n\nThis team won’t be focusing on contributing to projects already maintained by The Foundation (eg. client, builder, marketplace). If they do, they will be treated by the maintainers as regular open-source contributions.\n\nA list of things to work on the Governance dApp at the moment:\n\n*   Automate generation of reports.\n*   Replace Aragon's UI to ease DAO Committee operations.\n*   Add a Treasury page showing stats of the current treasury.\n*   Add a Grants page showing all grants that have been or are being funded by the DAO.\n*   Add a Members' page listing current teams and members.\n*   Load forum comments on the proposal to encourage discussion.\n*   Implement automatic status updates of proposals in the forum.\n*   Work on reports on technical viability about discussed proposals.\n*   Implement content moderation tools for the community, DAO Facilitator, and DAO Committee to help filter out offensive, poorly defined, or spammy proposals.\n*   Improve the proposal creation process by adding new proposal categories for common actions in the DAO.\n*   Advance the grant program to include larger grants with a more robust vetting and oversight process\n\nFunding a team to work primarily on the Governance dApp will produce faster development than relying on individual contributions because of their capability of shipping cross-cutting features.\n\nThis is a push to boost Decentraland’s ecosystem. We’ll start with one piece by building a team to improve it. If this strategy proves successful we could build more scoped teams to maintain and build other projects.\n\nThe point of this proposal is to reach a consensus that the DAO should begin the process of forming its own dApps team. The details of how many members, what their roles are, how much they are paid and how often, and how the DAO can oversee their work should be covered in a separate proposal(s).\n\n### Vote\n\n*   **For**: Hire a dApps team to help build the DAO\n*   **Against**: Do not hire a dApps team to help build the DAO\n\n- Hire a dApps team to help build the DAO\n- Do not hire a dApps team to help build the DAO\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8c144570-1803-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)**",

    "body": "> by 0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc\n\n### Summary\n\nReimburse gas fees spent by DAO Committee Members when enacting transactions for the DAO.\n\n### Abstract\n\nThe DAO Committee is responsible for sending on-chain transactions in order to update Decentraland’s Smart Contracts.\n\nEverytime a votation about Catalyst, POI, Ban and Grants passes, we send two transactions to the Aragon’s DAO contract in order to enact the proposal. The first transaction creates the action on the DAO and we have to wait 24 hours before we can send a second transaction to execute it. This delay period was included for security, during that time the action can be paused by any DAO committee or SAB member.\n\nThese two transactions have significant gas costs measured in ETH. The fee is extracted from the wallet sending the transaction, the DAO Committee Member’s wallet.\n\nThere are other cases in which the members of the DAO Committee also spend gas, for example deploying vesting contracts and transferring the ownership of them to the DAO. Some polls may also require the Committee to take on-chain action which incurs in gas fees.\n\nThe addresses of the DAO Committee are:\n\n*   0xfe91C0c482E09600f2d1DBCA10FD705BC6de60bc (Yemel)\n*   0xBef99f5f55CF7cDb3a70998C57061B7e1386a9b0 (HPrivakos)\n*   0x3323B7264F7D5e8f98e6aFCcec73b6bA1116AE19 (Eric)\n\n### Motivation\n\nI’m the one who has sent more transactions in the group. To the moment I have sent 98 transactions and spent 1.033 ETH in gas fees. Here is the  [list of transactions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f4QIX1oflPVd4\\_5zS8AZmkIHQA4numma6m5mWMBCdu4/edit?usp=sharing)  downloaded from  <https://fees.wtf/> . Note that I only use this address for my DAO Committee role.\n\n### Specification\n\nThis proposal is to allow the monthly reimbursement of gas fees to DAO Committee Members. The reimbursement will be calculated by the DAO Committee and the operation will be noted in the next bi-weekly report.\n\nThis might only be necessary as a temporary stop-gap measure. In an ideal scenario, DAO Committee members shouldn’t be paying gas costs nor doing manual accounting tasks. This kind of operation should be solved by automation and better infrastructure.\n\n### Vote\n\n*   **For**: Approve the recurrent reimbursement of gas fees to DAO Committee Members\n*   **Against**: Reject the reimbursement of gas fees to DAO Committee Members\n\n- Approve the recurrent reimbursement of gas fees to DAO Committee Members\n- Reject the reimbursement of gas fees to DAO Committee Members\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f3f19d40-17ff-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)**",

When you claim (mint) a name it is displayed as yourname.dcl.eth However it is also possible to further claim (mint) names from yourname by using the https://app.ens.domains/ app\n\nAs a test I have successfully minted surprise name from kinder DCL name. This name now reads surprise.kinder. You can see it from this link below\n\nhttps://app.ens.domains/name/surprise.kinder 3\n\nRight now this name is a token only. For it to become an ERC721 NFT a new smart contract will need to written. This will make it usable within the Decentraland platform.\n\nWhy this proposal is important?\n\nMany existing and new platforms and projects are now coming into DCL. Decentraland Metaverse is an excellent place for brand recognition, awareness, adoption, marketing, advertising. It even works for individuals and small teams.\n\nSlowly we are seeing the formations of guilds, groups, teams, friends, families, fans and much more. The idea behind this new proposal is only the make things more fun, exciting while adding another utility to names.\n\nEach event is just getting bigger and better with more players coming in. The most recent CocaCola event was totally epic. So I thought to my self wouldn’t it be fun if the CocaCola team members all had names? for example imagine they are named diet.cocacola, zerosugar.cocacola, vanilla.cocacola and so on. Straight away you would know who the official representatives are because of their name. Many other example can be given. However it does not have to be a company or a business’s. It can be fan based groups. Let’s say a group of females are super into Bratz and they can have the names meygan.bratz, yasmin.bratz and cloe.bratz.\n\nSubdomains can be minted directly from ens domain website. Although all the names are NFT’s the subdomains on the other hand are only tokens. For the subdomains to become NFT’s a new smart-contract has to be created.\n\nThis will allow all subdomains to be easily used, transferred, traded just like any other NFT\n\nMain usage for dcl subdomains\n\n*   Guilds, Groups\n*   Friends, Families\n*   Businesses, Brands\n*   Platforms, Projects\n*   Games, Events\n*   Giveaways, Prizes\n\nhttps://forum.decentraland.org/t/create-a-new-smart-contract-for-decentraland-names-subdomain-s-to-be-nft-s/1850\n\nPlease vote \"YES\" or \"NO\"\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1c4bd950-1296-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)**",

    "body": "> by 0x5a659a97dfbd423a8824d472c879135b7e6c2227 (deadstock)\n\nAs it stands today, wearables creators must publish the entirety of their collection at once. There is no ability to add to it after it's originally been published.  For any creator trying to bring new items to market on a regular rhythm - versus all at once at the beginning - this leads to a bad consumer experience, as the newer wearables must be created, approved and published in a new collection with a different name.\n\nCreators should have the ability to flow newness into their existing collection over the course of a year, thus creating excitement with avatars/players and a reason to revisit a shop/marketplace.  Imagine:  sneaker drops from your favorite creator 4x/year or apparel creators launching t-shirts and jackets on a seasonal basis,  all under a single, easy to shop collection taxonomy.  In other metaverses, the artist has the ability to do this.\n\nThis proposal specifically is to enable artists to manage their collection by adding items over time instead of the collection being locked in upon the initial mints.  To be clear, the proposal calls for the same DAO item-level approval as happens now.  This is decidedly NOT a proposal asking the DAO to grant approval on the first items and then carte blanche ability for the artist to do whatever they want in the later ones.   The DAO will still maintain approval at the item level, and artists will revert back to the DAO when ready to extend their lines of product.  This change would simply allow artists to choose whether to publish in a separate collection or to add to their existing, likely master, collection.\n\nUltimately, it is DCL players that benefit as they will be able to more clearly track newness and shop from artist collections they prefer.  Plus, the marketplace browsing will be less cluttered.   As it stands today, many artists have multiple collections - upwards of 10 - and to scroll through these takes time for the shopper.  Allowing an option of a single master collection will streamline browsing and buying for DCL consumers.\n\n- Allow wearables creators to add new items to existing collections, assuming DAO item approval\n- Do not allow any new items to be added to existing collections, even if DAO has approved the item\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=35e10620-1015-11ec-853d-5ff6f49b5cff)**",

These tasks ensure constant communication between the committee and the community.\n\nThe community needs help editing proposals for clarity and needs help maintaining high standards of discussion in order to make use of the funds and talent at the DAO’s disposal. These tasks ensure governance remains accessible to anyone who has a good idea and easy to participate in for anyone with a good opinion.\n\n### Objectives\n\n*   Increase participation within the Decentraland DAO\n*   Liaise between the DAO Committee and the community\n*   Increase the amount and quality of community discourse\n*   Help facilitate productive conversations and field questions related to the DAO\n\n### The candidate\n\nAfter the [open call for candidates](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-facilitator-job-call-for-nominees/1911/2), phergyson nominated Matimio on the forum, who then accepted the nomination. I had a conversation w/ Matimio and I believe he would make a fantastic DAO Facilitator.\n\n\"I am a PhD Candidate in Future Studies and Political Science, researching democratic futures, future governance models and the “biopolitical” significance of sanctuary, for example, sanctuary cities or the practice of seeking refuge in a protected space from the sovereign power/law of the state - something that may have increasing relevance in metaverse and blockchain spaces. In the Mevaterse space, I am:\n\n*   An active member of the Decentraland community and member of the Lastslice Collective.\n*   Building “The DCLSanctuary”, which is a POI and premised in part on my PhD Dissertation and aims to be an intellectual center of gravity for metaverse research, analysis and public policy.\n*   Moderator for Deadheads NFT, primarily brought on to consult on issues of governance\n*   Moderator for The Alien Boy NFT, also brought on to help with community management and governance\n*   Project Manager for Cardano NFT Project: The Ronin Universe\n*   I am already actively monitoring and participating in the DCL and other DAOs in the Metaverse and NFT space, and the combination of my academic/professional expertise and digital community facilitation/management experience, I believe, makes me an ideal fit for this position.\n\nI hope to have the opportunity to work with and for the DCL Community, and appreciate you considering me for this position.\n\n\\-Matimio (aka: Mat)\"\n\nYou can read Matimio's post history on the forum [here](https://forum.decentraland.org/u/matimio/summary) or search for him on Discord, Matimio#4673.\n\n### DAO Facilitator Responsibilities\n\n*   Compose and publish the Decentraland DAO Committee reports (include attending DAO Committee meetings and taking notes).\n*   Compose and publish the DAO Community Grants updates. Summarize grantee activity regularly and expose grant project progress to the community. Flag grant recipients that have not made satisfactory progress.\n*   Organize, schedule, and administrate community member meetups in the DAO hub\n    To discuss current proposals, issues, and questions related to the DAO\n    To be held as often as needed but at least once a month and accommodating various time zones.\n*   Share strategic feedback with the Decentraland Foundation Governance team regarding community engagement and user needs within the DAO.\n*   Schedule and organize community roundtable discussions for noteworthy issues\n    \\-- To be held as needed\n    \\-- Take notes and summarize for community\n\n### Compensation\n\nUp to 15 hours/week\n2000 MANA/month, paid monthly\n\nOver the last summer I have acted as a sort of proto-facilitator and begun setting up the infrastructure for a Facilitator to succeed (DAO hub, publishing schedules, stakeholders) and talked to many community members and Foundation team members to find the most valuable activities for this role. However, the responsibilities of a Facilitator should evolve to adapt to the community’s needs over time. What is written here is simply what I see as the most useful set of responsibilities right now.\n\n- Hire Matimio as the DAO Facilitator\n- Do not hire Matimio, pause creation of Committee Reports, Grant Reports\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ae944bc0-0b7b-11ec-a5a8-05cb7ba30f57)**",

During our meta-delegate meetings, students from around the globe come together to present, discuss, and debate new and existing Decentraland proposals.

Through the BEN Decentraland Meta-Delegate, our hope is to engage students and professors from universities all around the world with Decentraland governance.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe started with a discussion group on the BEN Learn for the Decentraland Meta-Delegate. We collected interest from our students across various universities and various countries and hosted some virtual events in Decentraland. We also already hosted our first internal poll for our meta-delegate to get thoughts and consensus from our students on the recent proposal on whether wearables should count for voting power.\n\nOur next steps are to accrue voting power from our students, alumni, and community supporters that own MANA and LAND for the Meta-Delegate. That way, it becomes more attractive for students to participate.\n\nAs an example, we recently were one of the grantees for the Aave Grants DAO as well as receiving 2.5m in UNI voting power to use for our Uniswap meta-delegate per a16z. Since then, BEN’s Uniswap Meta-Delegate has gone on to participate in the currently active Arbitrum deployment proposal. We pushed an internal vote to over 40+ student representatives from various universities across the globe and then cast the official meta-delegate vote in the Uniswap voting portal according to the internal result.

I saw a lot of people complain about not being able to create wearables so you can have support.

Y aún si no gana la propuesta al menos va a ejercer presión para que liberen los wearables en Polygon.\n\nUna posible sanción es eliminar el Punto de Interes del mapa (es decir que no figuren en el mapa), a menos que habiliten la función de crafting, o que coloquen una advertencia visible en el juego diciendo que el crafting está deshabilitado.\n\n- wonder zone\n- bad game\n- wereables\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b1bceaa0-09c8-11ec-a4d1-8d5d2cba0825)**",

    "title": "Updating Fee Structure for Wearable Secondary Sales",
    "body": "> by 0xb3ab3a2f58a7d91fe3dcf9abad53c0dd1603b847 (Reyean)\n\nWearables sales are booming in Decentraland (DCL) as platform adoption increases and since support for Polygon (Matic) Wearables was added. Upon Wearable submission, DCL receives 500 MANA from the content creator, and, from there, if approved and minted, the proceeds from the Primary Sale of the wearable go to the content creator.\n\nFor Secondary Sales of ETH Mainnet Wearables on OpenSea, 2.5% goes to OpenSea and nothing goes to DCL. For Secondary Sales of Matic Wearables on OpenSea, the situation is reversed: 2.5% goes to DCL and nothing goes to OpenSea.\n\nYou can view DCL's proceeds from these secondary sales here: https://polygonscan.com/address/0x9a6ebe7e2a7722f8200d0ffb63a1f6406a0d7dce#tokentxns\n\nIn both cases, however, no secondary sale proceeds go to the content creator. This poll/proposal focuses on Matic Wearables and suggests no changes to the ETH Mainnet Wearables Secondary Sales logic. For Matic Wearables, a few options are:\n\n(1) Keep everything as is\n(2) Keep 2.5% Total Fee, but Give to Content Creator\n(3) Add 2.5% Fee for Content Creator to Existing 2.5% Fee to DCL\n\nLooking forward to seeing the discussion around this as well as hearing from the DCL Foundation the feasibility of each approach. At the outset, I'm personally leaning toward option (2) in order to keep total fees low.\n\n- Keep Fee As Is\n- Keep 2.5% Total Fee, but Give to Content Creator\n- Add 2.5% Fee for Content Creator to Existing 2.5% Fee to DCL\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b70c59d0-09c5-11ec-a4d1-8d5d2cba0825)**",

Tourist Hub: Showcasing historic NFTs in Decentraland will increase visitors and can help Decentraland in becoming a virtual tourist hub.\n\n2.  Diversification of DAO funds: CryptoPunks NFTs value is steadily rising and as liquid as cryptocurrencies. So investing in such assets increases the DAO fund stability. It is equivalent to buying GOLD.\n\n3.  Free Advertising: Since VISA acquired one of the CryptoPunks there is a lot of attention towards NFTs especially CryptoPunks. This could help in grabbing more media attention and private investor which would accelerate the growth of Decentraland.\n\n4.  It is inevitable that metaverses(or private investors inside metaverse) start buying these NFTs to showcase them for their visitors. It is better to be first than play catchup in acquiring these assets.\n\nSome recent news and resources\n\n1.  VISA company buying CryptoPunks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLxmQiFVj1U\n2.

    "title": "Allow the DAO to recover lost assets",
    "body": "> by 0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc\n\n### Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to standardize a process for the very exceptional case that a user requests Decentraland’s DAO to regain control of LAND and ESTATES owned by an account to which the original owner has lost access to.\n\n### Terms\n\n*   **Abandoned LAND**: LAND that has not been used in any way since the terraform auction. Use includes deployments, transfers, marketplace listings (including unfulfilled), and the owner of the account signing into the marketplace.\n\n*   **Lost Assets**: LAND and/or ESTATES held by an account where the associated private key has been lost. Does not include LAND or ESTATES transferred to an account through accident or theft, or LAND that has been abandoned.\n\n*   **Claimant**: a user with claim to Lost Assets.\n\n### Abstract\n\nA user who has lost access to a private key and therefore to all LAND and ESTATES held by their account must have a way to present her case to the DAO in order to regain control of her Lost Assets. The DAO can not use this procedure to reclaim abandoned LAND. The DAO can only use this procedure to recover Lost Assets owned by a user who has lost their account’s private key.\n\nThe claimant needs to present evidence beyond reasonable doubt about the incident to prove herself the rightful owner of the lost account. The case will be published on the forum and will be reviewed by a Judicial Committee to ensure it complies with *the requirements (see below)*.\n\nIf the case is approved by the committee, the claimant will be granted permission to **deploy new content** on the Lost Assets owned by the lost account but **won’t be able to transfer the LAND and ESTATES for a period of time (12 months)**.\n\nDuring that period of time, the lost account and the DAO will retain the power to revoke deployment permissions of the claimant. After that year the claimant will be able to transfer their assets freely.\n\n### Motivation\n\nPrivate keys will be lost and some users will fail in their efforts to protect their assets. In case of loss, if enough proof is presented to the DAO the rightful owner should regain access to her LAND and ESTATES tokens. See [Ethen’s case](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/vote-yes-to-return-lost-land-and-set-the-precedent-for-this-moving-forward/296) as the first example.\n\nToday it is technically possible to make a secure setup to overcome the loss of a key. For example by granting co-ownership to a second account or a multisig shared with friends.\n\nHowever, given the current undeveloped state of the user experience for Ethereum, Web 3.0, and cryptocurrency in general with regards to advanced key management schemes, this kind of setup requires high technical knowledge from users.\n\nThis proposal aims to help those who fall into misfortune by providing a last hope, a journey to recover a lost account.\n\n### Specification\n\nThe ERC721 standard defines the concept of approvedForAll; ​​an owner-wide role that can transfer any ERC721 of the owner, and also set UpdateManager roles. [See roles recap](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/a-recap-land-ownership-deployment-permissions/12).\n\nThis proposal requires updating the LAND and ESTATE smart contracts to add a mechanism that allows the DAO to set the co-owner of a lost account.\n\nThe update will be a new method on the registry that allows the DAO to set the approvedForAll role to an arbitrary address.\n\nThe new co-owner will be a smart contract that will function as an escrow of the assets first giving the claimant permission to update land and estates and after twelve months the claimant will be able to transfer the assets.\n\nDuring a period of twelve months, the lost address and the DAO will keep the power to revoke the contract, an action that will return the LANDs and ESTATEs to the original owner.\n\nThe proposed changes to the LAND and ESTATE Registry are [here](https://github.com/decentraland/land/pull/152/files). The intermediary contract is still pending and an external audit is still required.\n\n### Application Requirements\n\nTo kick off this process the user needs to present her case publicly on the forum including all evidence possible. The case will be reviewed by the Judicial Committee.\nFollowing a proposed guideline of requirements:\n\n*   The “lost” address must have a minimum of six months of inactivity.\n    *   Specifically, no executed transactions by this wallet, either signing or sending txs.\n    *   If the claimant has received anything inadvertently, this is not an indication that they have access to this wallet (air drops, scam coins, etc. )\n*   The user provides a description of how the key was lost.\n*   Objective proof of ownership, some examples are:\n    *   Private messages signed with the “lost” key.\n    *   LAND description linking to claimant’s personal info.\n*   Two witnesses testify on behalf of the user (over video).\n    *   Character witness: Familiar with claimant’s cripto-goins (friend, work colleague).\n    *   Expert witness: Developer or Community Member with technical experience.\n\nUltimately it will be the Judicial Committee's decision to approve or reject the application. In case of doubt (by any member) the application will be rejected.\n\n### Judicial Committee\n\nThe three recommended committee members proposed alongside this new implementation are:\n\n*   Carl Fravel - Technology Executive, Member of many DCL districts.\n*   Peter Derrick - DCL “Bartertown” estate owner and long-time contributor.\n*   Yemel Jardi - Software Engineer and early contributor to DCL.\n\nIt is suggested and proposed that these committee members remain active for an initial period of 6 months before opening a poll to replace or renew them.\n\n### Main Concerns\n\n**Can the DAO reclaim abandoned LAND?**\n\nNo, this proposal does not address the issue of abandoned land, this is for future consideration.\n\n**Is this too much power to the DAO?**\n\nThe process needs to be started by the claimant and the decision is made by the Judicial Committee. The DAO should not use this method for other cases without a formal community vote.\n\n**How can the DAO prevent fraud?**\n\nThe address must be inactive for a period of six months and in case of approval, the claimant won’t be able to sell the land for a period of a year, giving time to the presumed “lost key” to appear and stop this process.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n*   Form the Committee but don’t upgrade the contracts. Give the DAO a budget to buy land and return it to the claimant.\n\n*   Upgrade the contracts but don’t form the Committee, just let the DAO to judge case by case.\n\n*   Do nothing to help users that lost keys and handle the land as if were abandoned.\n\n### Vote\n\n**For**: Upgrade Decentraland’s smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of LAND and ESTATES from a lost account.\n\n**Against**: Do not upgrade Decentraland’s smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of LAND and ESTATES from a lost account.\n\n**Other**: Revise the structure and terms of the proposal and publish a revised version.\n\n- For: Upgrade Decentraland’s smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of lost assets\n- Against: Do not upgrade Decentraland’s smart contracts to empower the DAO to regain control of lost assets\n- Other: Revise the structure and terms of the proposal.\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=3f890970-052f-11ec-a4d1-8d5d2cba0825)**",

    "title": "Create a new grant tier to fund the development of play-to-earn games",
    "body": "> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nAn addendum to the [Proposal for a Community Grants Framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b265e3e0-bcb0-11eb-a871-a927ffd81f49) whereby a new grant tier is added, providing $30k/mo for three months for teams making play-to-earn games.\n\n**ABSTRACT**\n\nThe community grant framework funds small projects resulting in decent user-generated content. However, the initial tiers are insufficient for larger scope projects. Meanwhile, projects like [Decentral Games](http://decentral.games) were born out of a larger grant that gave them the resources to create an MVP attracting angel and institutional capital.\n\nThis new tier would use the DAO to fund pre-existing teams building play-to-earn games in Decentraland. Many such teams exist, but it's up to the DAO and the community to attract them to the platform through funding, support, and guidance.\n\n**MOTIVATION**\n\nThe most engaging scenes are mid-sized games. Without a clear path for small teams to finance and launch an MVP of their project on Decentraland, the talent will flock to other metaverses.\n\nDue to the success of Axie Infinity, many teams want to build play-to-earn games. Decentraland is well-equipped to host these, with a fully-fledged SDK, a vibrant community, and an integration with Polygon enabling low-cost, near-instant transfers of digital assets.\n\nWith a small investment, the Decentraland community could give rise to numerous games of the caliber of [WonderMine](https://wondermine.wonderzone.io/), Decentral Games, and [Ethermon](https://ethermon.io/).\n\n**SPECIFICATION**\n\n**The new grant category would consist of:**\n\n*   $30k USD (in MANA) / month, for 3 months\n\n**What are play-to-earn games?**\n\nThis new tier may only play-to-earn games. The MVPs must:\n\n1.  Be an interactive game\n2.  Feature on-chain assets (fungible and/or non-fungible tokens)\n3.  Give users the ability to earn on-chain assets by playing the game\n\nAfter 1.5 months, recipients should provide an MVP: an interactive scene with a functional play-to-earn mechanic. The DAO will review these MVPs, voting on whether or not to execute the third payment.\n\n**Mentorship**\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation could curate a list of mentors who would be able to coach recipients through the grant's duration.\n\n**LAND**\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation could help pair recipients with LAND owners.\n\n**Applications**\n\nTeams will use an extension of the existing DAO grants form to apply. Additional requirements include:\n\n*   1 page document summarizing the proposed game and its play-to-earn mechanic\n\nThis new tier may only be applied for in the last month of each quarter. Applications will only be accepted for one week, once per quarter.\n\nThe DAO would vote on each applicant. The three teams receiving the most VP would be selected, with a min of 2 million VP needed.\n\n**Schedule**\n\n*   **Q3 2021**\n*   **Aug**\n*   Begin accepting applications by 8/26\n*   **Sep**\n*   Applications close 9/2\n*   Winners announced 9/9\n*   First payment by 9/13\n*   **Q4 2021**\n*   **Oct**\n*   MVP by end of October\n*   DAO votes to continue funding\n*   Second payment pending DAO approval\n*   **Nov**\n*   Third payment\n\n**Reporting**\n\nThe DAO Committee and Facilitator would be responsible for monitoring progress, providing public reports every 2 weeks.\n\n**BENEFITS**\n\n*   Attracts talented and experienced teams to Decentraland\n*   Creates content that will help to boost Decentraland's attractiveness and retention\n*   Attract capital to invest in Decentraland experiences\n\n- For: Approve the addition of the play-to-earn grant tier\n- Against: Reject the addition of the play-to-earn grant tier\n- Other: Revise the structure and terms of the play-to-earn tier\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8ade3990-0061-11ec-bf2e-8bc0e796957b)**",

    "body": "> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)\n\n**Abstract**\n\nTo incentivize members of the curation committee, we need to compensate them for their time and contributions.\n\n**This is a revised proposal based on the outcome and discussion of [this proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a4d9d090-f330-11eb-ab97-bfa89f33c258) to compensate Curation Committee Members.**\n\n**Need**\n\nThe Wearables Curation Committee was formed to help ensure that all published wearables are technically sound before they are minted on Polygon and made permanently available to users.\n\nThe Curation committee is also tasked with identifying and flagging any submissions that may violate Decentraland's Content Policy and Terms of Use. These submissions are not to be vetted by the Committee but are instead passed onto the DAO for final approval or rejection. The \"handing off\" process for these submissions still takes effort and time from the Committee members.\n\nIn order to incentivize committee members to do this work, they need to be compensated fairly. Failing to compensate the Curation Committee will result in faster turn-over within the committee, and (likely) a subsequent decrease in the volume and quality of minted wearables.\n\n**Approach**\n\nPeople who submit Decentraland wearables for publication must pay a fee of 500 MANA per item in each collection submitted. A portion of these fees needs to be used to compensate the committee.\n\nI suggest that each committee member be compensated with 10% of the publication fee (50 MANA) per item processed, regardless of whether the item is approved or rejected. These payments can be made in MANA by the DAO Committee on a monthly basis. Retroactive payments should be executed to compensate the committee for work they've done since June 1st.\n\nAccording to [this query](https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/subgraph/decentraland/collections-matic-mainnet?query=Totals) on the Graph, the committee has published **227 separate collections** for a total of **466 items** since the launch of the Wearables Editor on **June 1, 2021** (as of the time of writing on August 12th). This total includes all submissions, including those that are rejected.\n\nWith the publication fee set at **500 MANA per item**, the DAO has collected **233,000 MANA** between June 1st and August 12th.\n\nDuring the previous 73 days, this averages to:\n\n*   1 collection / day / committee member\n*   2.13 items / day / committee member\n\nAt the suggested rate of 50 MANA/item/committee member, **each member would receive a rough average of 3,195 MANA / month.**\n\n**Benefit**\n\nBasing compensation on the number of items processed has several benefits:\n\n*   Each month, running a Graph query to calculate the amount of MANA to transfer to the committee members is simple and efficient.\n*   The data that each month's compensation is based off is transparent and public for the community.\n*   Starting at 50 MANA per creates incentives to grow the committee, and increase the number of wearables processed.\n\n- Compensate Curators 50 MANA per item\n- Compensate Curators, but find another rate\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=268c9620-fc6b-11eb-bf2e-8bc0e796957b)**",

The Decentraland DAO will be the first DAO to conduct avatar-based 3D governance discussion and voting.\n\n3.  Activity in the #dao channel and #town-hall channels in Decentraland+ discord proves the community need for ad-hoc discussion places.\n\n4.  Finally, out of principle, the DAO must have a presence in the world that it governs.\n\nInitially, the scene will be hosted in a district.

Below outlines how this could work.\n\nThe benefit to Decentraland is that you would be able to sell items directly from Decentraland, without directing users to other external applications. Right now, when you click on an NFT, you get something like this:\n\nLink to Example: https://gov.rarible.com/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2ff79e50f8b24000e668c1249be70400905a06fd.jpeg\n\nThese NFTs can be purchased on Opensea currently, and it is even possible for parcel owners to monetize on OpenSea referral fees (1%).\n\nUsing the Rarible Protocol, we can do much better. Rarible Protocol is the only open source and community owned NFT exchange protocol.\n\nOther Useful Links:\n\nRarible Snapshot: https://snapshot.org/#/rarible.eth/proposal/QmT5HNVtGhSVvHUaiTVgCeJdmrbByp26skwcjwwexpB5gd\n\nRarible Forum:\nhttps://gov.rarible.com/t/decentraland-rarible-protocol-integration/16599\n\nDecentraland Forum:\nhttps://forum.decentraland.org/t/decentraland-rarible-protocol-integration/1653\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWhat would this look like after integration with the Rarible Protocol?\n\n1.  Items could be purchased directly from within the interface\n2.  A fee could be set within the interface (2.5% for example, which is what Rarible.com has)\n3.  That fee could be directed to Decentraland DAO (it is possible to set this fee upon creation of this integration, OR, we could just set it to zero. Maybe we could have a separate vote to determine what fee to include for Decentraland DAO)\n4.  Fees and Royalties from external platforms (like SuperRare) could be carried over using the protocol\n5.  NFTs from different blockchains could also be displayed (for example, we are integrating with Flow, Polygon, Moonbeam)\n6.  What is even more cool is that the Rarible Protocol has fee splitting. So for example, a parcel owner could display NFTs that he does not even own, and receive a % of fees from that process!\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nIn terms of implementation, HPrivakos has expressed interest in helping with this.\nA portion of the fund will be used for design work or possible support from other devs, which will be handled by HPrivakos.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis is a co-funded grant application between Rarible DAO and Decentraland DAO. This proposal is asking for:\n\nA grant to develop this functionality. Rarible DAO and Decentraland DAO can fund this together, with a 5K contribution from Decentraland DAO (vested over 3 months with a 1 month cliff as per Decentraland Community Grants). Rarible DAO is asked to contribute 7K, with 1/2 paid upfront and 1/2 upon completion.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=691c8e60-f3c8-11eb-ab97-bfa89f33c258)**",

    "body": "> by 0x00d0e85cad26ce0f456db566721346cc4d2fd44c (Deliverator)\n\n### Abstract:\n\nTo incentivize members of the curation committee, we need to compensate them for their time and contributions.\n\n### Need\n\nThe Wearables Curation Committee was formed to help ensure that all published wearables are technically sound before they are minted on Polygon and made permanently available to users.\n\nThe Curation committee is also tasked with identifying and flagging any submissions that may violate Decentraland's Content Policy and Terms of Use. These submissions are not to be vetted by the Committee but are instead passed onto the DAO for final approval or rejection. The \"handing off\" process for these submissions still takes effort and time from the Committee members.\n\nIn order to incentivize committee members to do this work, they need to be compensated fairly. Failing to compensate the Curation Committee will result in faster turn-over within the committee, and (likely) a subsequent decrease in the volume and quality of minted wearables.\n\n### Approach\n\nPeople who submit Decentraland wearables for publication must pay a fee of 500 MANA per item in each collection submitted. A portion of these fees needs to be used to compensate the committee.\n\nI suggest that each committee member be compensated at an initial rate of $30 USD per item processed, regardless of whether the item is approved or rejected. These payments can be made in MANA by the DAO Committee on a monthly basis. Retroactive payments should be executed to compensate the committee for work they've done since June 1.\n\nAccording to this query on the Graph, the committee has published 135 separate collections for a total of 299 items since the launch of the Wearables Editor on June 1, 2021 (as of the time of writing on July 15th). This total includes all submissions, including those that are rejected.\n\nWith the publication fee set at 500 MANA per item, the DAO has collected 149,500 MANA between June 1 and July 15.\n\nDuring the previous 45 days, this averages to:\n\n*   1 collection / day / committee member\n*   2.21 items / day / committee member\n\nAt the suggested rate of $30 USD/item/committee member, each member would receive a rough average of $1989 USD / month (based on the previous 45 days worth of data).\n\n### Benefit\n\nBasing compensation on the number of items processed has several benefits:\n\n*   Each month, running a Graph query to calculate the amount of MANA to transfer to the committee members is simple and efficient\n*   The data that each month's compensation is based off is transparent and public for the community\n*   Starting at $30 USD per item leaves room to grow the committee, and increase the number of wearables processed\n\n- Compensate Curators -  30 USD p/item\n- Compensate Curators - Find another rate\n- No compensation for Curators\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a4d9d090-f330-11eb-ab97-bfa89f33c258)**",

I understand that this is how the DAO is setup and questioning it is not my goal here. It just feels weird/inappropriate to be in a 'rejected' category, the same as some off-topic or bad proposals, when the outcome is 80-20.\n\nBy adding an 'insufficient VP' category, it would be easier to distinguish such proposals from *truly* rejected ones. This would in turn ease the resubmitting process because I think allowing users that did not have enough VP to resubmit is ok whereas having a 95% 'no' proposal resubmitted is not relevant. We could then have something like 'this proposal is a resubmission of that other proposal'.\n\nLinks:\n\n1 : [My dashboard proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=76e8e960-e6a5-11eb-89c8-f9c6d1f05e5b)\n\n2 : [Minimum acceptance thresholds](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/requesting-grants/#minimum-acceptance-thresholds)\n\n- Yes\n- No\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=797ba280-ef06-11eb-ba81-318d080cd8d0)**",

This will be an NFT rebate and referral voucher meant to incentivize players to purchase wearables from participating vendors as well as to share the rebate via referring a friend's wallet address, whereby the voucher then shows up in there wallet available to use on their first purchase. The voucher will become void if it is not used in a specified time frame. I will describe the model in more detail in the description field.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xeFd13F676744a527B1adce0b3c05834a54640ca8\n\n## Description\n\nThe Circulating Rebate/Referral voucher is an NFT voucher designed to allow the player to receive a 10% discount on their next NFT purchase after making an initial purchase at participating vendor's stores. After the voucher is redeemed for the discount, it may then be either voided by the qualifying player, or sent to a referral wallet address whereby the referral will then receive 10% off of their first purchase and will have the same option to void or refer the rebate after redeeming it. The players referring the rebate will then have their name entered into the decentraland data base to participate on the next series of what I am calling the \"Perpetual Gratuity Week\" should their referral redeem their rebate. In this manner, the participating vendors will see a boost in their sales, the players will be given an incentive to purchase new wearables and items, the platform will be lively with activity and buzz, the players will enjoy the appearance of fresh new items to enjoy when engaging on Decentraland, and the word will get out that Decentraland is the place to be for fun events that reward creators and players alike. This can be further illustrated by wrapping up the week with a ceremonial event to reward the vendor that sells the most items with an NFT trophy and to award the player with the most qualified referrals with a free NFT item from one of the participating store's promotional items. This should be a quarterly event so as to keep the platform appealing to players and creators and to allure new players and vendors with opportunity and excitement.\nThe best way to help fund this would be for the Decentraland DAO to use portions of the sales fees collected from participating vendors sales and from the publishing fees of those same vendors that mint their NFT items. Early registration of vendors would be necessary and the allocation of a portion of those fees into the event fund would be necessary to bring this proposal to event-ready status. Advertising the event and the participating vendors and any other sponsors should be done on the many billboards across Decentraland, and the fees for that should be calculated and charged when the participating vendors register for the event. The voucher will be minted in accordance with the exact number of NFT items each participating vendor is registering as available for purchase to the DAO as confirmation of the inventory count for the number of rebates that can be issued. The discord servers and social media should also be used to promote this event. The best way to describe this proposal is that it is incentivization via participation.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis is an NFT voucher to purchase NFT's from participating vendors, and to incentivize the purchaser to share the voucher via referring a friend's wallet, who will then have the same opportunity to redeem the voucher and refer a friend as well. I will use the grant to employ a programmer to write the code for this NFT and I will then issue it to the Decentraland DAO for them to mint the necessary amount of vouchers to equal the number of items each participating vendor is selling in this event.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI work with only one designer and coder for these types of projects. We have done collaborations in the past and I am confident we will deliver on this proposal in a timely manner with ease. I am currently working with a freelancer named Anmol M. from freelancer . com. He and I have a great working relationship and he has really came through for me in the past.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nI will only need two to three weeks to get this project done. The biggest barrier is that I will require the aid of the DAO in it's full implementation and event planning. If this barrier can be overcame, then I see this getting underway in a very brief time. I tend to drive the bottom line (respectfully) when it comes to deadlines and delivery. I treat those I am involved with in business with respect, appreciation and encouragement. I recognize that any goals worth achieving require the aid of the talented and the willing, and I invite those types to my circle to strive for achievement and to celebrate any success that follows. I am a bit of a visionary with enthusiasm to create and to build others up while doing so. I also believe in responsible capitalism and investing in others and their aims, should they be worthy of it. This is me, and this is my proposal, and I want to extend a big thank you for taking the time to consider my proposal.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=93194990-eddf-11eb-ba81-318d080cd8d0)**",

    "title": "Is it possible to create marketing NFTs for content in decentraland like crowds?",
    "body": "> by 0xe264886feb92e9c6a92fa196dfdc09d330b66c17\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAs decentraland grows ever so quickly, a lot of content created is not seen or aware to users. Is it possible to create NFTs like fireworks that could be utilised at their content to attract more users to that spot? For example, new services can have firework animations coming from there.  Or to make it more amazing, real life footage of fireworks created as an NFT. With a new service you would also expect a crowd around the content. Would it be possible to create, for example, NFTs of crowds? So currently we have nightclubs with DJs doing their most to promote their presence and venue. Would it be possible to have different sized NFTs according to crowd size which can be put at the content to create more awareness, like an advertising ploy\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n1,500 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x23Cf8AB359e16929944F1Aa8De0D3c5dCD3A520e\n\n## Description\n\nContent creators require marketing and advertising techniques to allow users an opportunity of letting them know of their presence. Inserting content in Decentraland and establishing their creations is one thing, but driving a market to it and creating sales is something not touched on. Fireworks for new content that shoots high in the air or crowds gathering around new content as you visibly approach it are a couple of ideas that I believe would work well in driving users to the new and exciting content available in Decentraland. What do you think?\n\n\n## Specification\n\nUsing the entertainment industry as an example from real world to Decentraland, Decentraland is missing the crowds at nightclubs in this instance. Videographers with prior crowd footage in the real world could create NFTs and sell this as crowd advertising, potentially being of interest to content creators wanting to get a bit of attention to what they have created. This type of footage is also harder to obtain and create these days due to covid and makes old footage and real footage some what new and valuable again.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI mention this because it is something I have readily available from one of the best DJs in South-East Asia and is something he would like to contribute to the crypto space, including his entrance in. I also have some fireworks lying around which I think could like nice in the virtual world. BAKOOM!!!\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMilestones and achievements could be documented as my team and I are already in progress with this concept. Creating different sized crowds or being able to select the size to go accordingly with the size of content created is one of the last issues before it could be rolled out.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=33993260-ec0d-11eb-ba81-318d080cd8d0)**",

Plus, by creating a dedicated website, I can offer a good amount of visualisation and depth into the stats.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x128dCcF449d95B4C23dECC98ecc1bC2126c99E19\n\n## Description\n\nThis would allow everyone to get a more precise look at Decentraland's size & impact. Also, as the owner of a scene (or a potential buyer), this might give you new insight that you currently cannot get unless you write your own tools.\n\nThe improvements I could bring include :\n\n*   Time graph of online users *with realm separation*\n*   Recent position of users on the map / possible timelapses\n*   Number of unique users in the last week/day/hour\n*   Number of users on a parcel (unique or not)\n\nAnalysis of the balances are also possible :\n\n*   ETH and MANA balance of users (other tokens are possible, ERC721 & L2 should be doable too)\n*   Total amount of ETH and MANA (and $USD maybe) present on DCL\n*   Average amount of ETH/user\n*   ETH distribution amongst users\n*   ...\n\nAlso, a lot of data comes from the parcels and the marketplace, so why not create some complementary tool that eases the deciding process for example.\n\nI think you get the point. There are a lot of data to analyse and I am full of ideas. Plus, with community feedback, the dashboard can be improved in the direction people want.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe code for my dashboard is already [open source](https://github.com/Rphad/Decentraland-Online-Users). I plan to use node and a database (SQL instead of a .csv as I did until now) to do the job.  Decentraland's API and other links will be used to collect the necessary data. Additionnaly, some time ago I already made some back-of-the-envelope programming to show the activity on the map of decentraland (you can see one of my images [here](https://imgur.com/a/Km2ci8L)). The code or data might not be fully accessible or open source at first (while I'm building), but the goal is to make it so afterwards.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI'm a student and autodidact who loves the technology behind the blockchain (yes, you read that right, I'm in it for the tech ! ) and who wants to build useful tools. I became familiar with Decentraland in late 2020 and immediately started experimenting with it. I've built some scenes, wandered through the metaverse, interacted with smart contracts and so on.\n\nNot only do I think I have the skills to make this dashboard, but I have already proven that I can do it. I wrote my website with HTML, CSS and JS; I can setup a server, use node, make graphs etc.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe first step will be to migrate what I have already done to a dedicated domain. Then, I'll start to write the scripts needed for data collection and automation in order to make a new addition (new graph for example). I will repeat that process and push the changes for every idea I get, until I run out of ideas. This makes sure that the dashboard gets better and better and that it doesn't takes forever to launch a v1.\n\nI'll start to work upon grant reception and expect to have a solid result after 1 month. Before that, the data available to see will be done incrementally, as I said.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=76e8e960-e6a5-11eb-89c8-f9c6d1f05e5b)**",

    "body": "> by 0xe58d9940a395d303e691dbe0676710d9c140101a (Archonomous)\n\nHello, Residents of Decentraland ~\n\nThis poll requests the ability for L2 wearables Creators to publish items to an existing wearables collection that they manage. This will allow Creators to expand existing collections within their 'brand' without having to plan and create every item within the collection beforehand. Of course, additions to existing collections would still require the same review by the Wearables Committee as any other item would prior to being published to the metaverse.\n\nThe reason for suggesting such an improvement is to allow for future expansion to existing collections, as well as to keep the collections within the marketplace and in-game wardrobes relatively organized. There are already Creators with a handful of separate published collections that may be better suited to live all in one collection, if the system allowed to add to existing contracts.\n\nEase of technological implementation aside, this poll constitutes a community ' 'temperature check' to get the issue out into the world and start discussing quality of life improvements such as these. Thank you for considering this request.\n\n- Yes, allow Creators to publish new wearables to their existing collections.\n- No, continue to require Creators to make a new collection with each wearables submission.\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=39bd4180-e579-11eb-bb4e-e9e2ebbd7fce)**",

Similar to on OpenSea, this change would make it so when you click on an item, it takes you to a marketplace page specifically for that item which would then list all current sale prices by amount/user. With a system like this, it may even allow for users to post 'buy' offers as a potential future feature.\n\nThe reason for suggesting such an improvement is to keep the marketplace uncluttered, especially with the recent unveiling of L2 wearables. I believe we all know what it's like to sort through 10 pages of rainbow earrings and grey hats, and I only see this issue getting more out of hand as wearables continue to release, especially in high quantity collections.\n\nEase of technological implementation aside, this poll constitutes a community '\n'temperature check' to get the issue out into the world and start discussing quality of life improvements such as these.

Eligibility could be based on how many votes a creator gets in a discord channel for their wearable before it is released. Or there could be some sort of verification process that gives the creator a discord role and then if they fail to pay the loan back after they have sold enough to do so, the role will be revoked\n\nI believe this would increase the number of wearable creators and therefore diversity of wearables and would mean grants wouldn't have to be given by the DAO as much.\n\n- yes\n- no\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d52bbdc0-e4d6-11eb-bb4e-e9e2ebbd7fce)**",

Aside from the inclusion of wearables, the newly proposed Terms of Use and Content Policy do not bring significant changes to the prior versions of these two documents.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThe Decentraland Terms of Use and Content Policy are in need of some updates, which should be approved by the Decentraland DAO:\n\n**Wearables**\n\nThe recent release of the Wearables Editor, which allows the community to mint NFTs, requires certain adjustments in the Terms of Use. More generally, certain adjustments have been made to present the driving philosophy of Decentraland in clearer and simpler language, i.e. that Decentraland users exclusively hold the IP rights over their creations.\n\n**General cleanup and edits for clarity**\n\nCertain minor adjustments and edits have been introduced throughout both documents to improve their clarity and readability,  making it easier to understand their  provisions.\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe specific, detailed modifications called for above have been made within the Terms of Use and Content Policy.

    "body": "> by 0xffac7fd045303112fdb28e9dace8e1334ad324c0 (eordano)\n\nContext: There are some polls that don't have feasible options to vote. One such example is [we in 2021](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7f4a1f60-c838-11eb-9861-ebb8fcfd58d2) or [How many people...?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f4ac0d20-bf2a-11eb-8849-33c326fb5301).\n\nThe poll [Should we be actively seeking developers for game design?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9adc5520-e018-11eb-a20f-d75df7f87ed8) came up in a conversation as an example of a poll with more than two \"no\" options. It might be interesting to have the Snapshot frontend automatically generate an option that signals to the creator of the poll that the question was framed incorrectly.\n\nIt might bring us some vote dilution, though. I propose that the votes towards the \"Invalid\" option don't count towards the threshold of 66% to accept a vote (for example, if 1M mana votes no, 3M mana vote yes, 2M mana vote invalid, that would count as 75% acceptance -- only the 1M of the \"no\" option and the 3M corresponding to the \"yes\" option would count).\n\n- Yes, automatically add an 'Invalid question/options' option to all polls\n- No, don't automatically add options \n- Maybe: this idea needs more work\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b841bb60-e0da-11eb-a20f-d75df7f87ed8)**",

With an increasing number of users, events and buildings, we believe in the future of Decentraland, and we want to push it forward through our expertise. However, as professional architects and urban designers, we found it tough to find a city or district with real Metaverse-style city planning, a friendly traffic system for users, and sufficient motivations to attract visitors and projects. Thus, we are here to bring our solutions, to build a prototype as a future metaverse city that is fancy, walking-friendly and vivid!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x05060Fa97e54a812d1E15cEc6c34e79f74eBD0b3\n\n## Description\n\nA. Usage of Grant: The grant will be used for the development of scenes and experience.\n\nB. The New Babylon City Prototype Size: about 30 parcels (Sponsored by Republic Realm)\n\nFor more information, please visit: https://metalivestudio.com/new-babylon\n\nC. Problem Statement: What are the challenges for Decentraland CIties and Districts?\n\n1.  City Planning is Toooooo Traditional for Metaverse\n\nMost of the city projects in Decentraland are similar to real life, which is extremely &ldquo;wired&ldquo; from our perspectives. On the one hand, most of the current planning practice ideas did not echo the culture of Metaverse. On the other hand, most city planning did not echo metaverse characteristics, including no-gravity, infinity light, and programming integration.\n\n2.  Virtual Cities are Difficult to maintain vitality\n\nThe vitality of the city needs user traffic. And the traffic of the city relies on the projects and activities inside. However, the current activities are too decentralized that make city hard to concentrate their users. It is very easy to see big cities with cool structures but have no constant user.\n\n3.  User-unfriendly in Short Distance travel\n\nTeleport functions make traditional long-distance vehicles meaningless, but people need to walk more enjoyable and efficiently in a short distance. We found out that only less than one per cent of people would use teleport within 8 parcels distance. And there is a lack of infrastructure that enable people to move faster and have more fun.\n\nFor more information, please visit: https://metalivestudio.com/new-babylon\n\nD.

No need for licensing. We all know what they look like and now one holds IP over those style of games. So please do not think I mean these actual games. I am merely using them as examples.  Each land or parcel could host different boards, levels and tracks. We could build stadiums where we congregate to watch. DCL members could form leagues, for example Tuesday night Goldeneye league where teams of 4 have already paid their league fee, say 100 mana for 8 weeks where the teams compete for prizes (NFTS, crypto) . Audience members can wager on the outcomes. Additionally individual users can wager crypto against each other whenever leagues aren't active. High scores can be dominantly displayed for bragging rights but also as a challenge to others. I also believe that this  will lead to a NFT explosion as they would give you an actual perk/powerup in the game. for example say a skull shifter on your kart in the race that give you a banana every lap. this makes a very prominent USE case for NFTS beyond looking cool.

Previously as advised - my character was broken up into sections to fit the wearable option limitations - lots of extra work has been done on these sections individually on their own rigs and to go back to a complete (merged) version would require a much older version of the character and too much extra work to get the build to its current form. The broken up parts had a lot of refinements done on them\nThe character is a little heavy and will only be in mythic category for a high price\n\nI have done a lot of testing in Decentraland and everything works as it should - 4 are reserved and the owners will agree to not wear the suit more than 1 set per event and never combined with other wearables as they will not fit well and will clash with the style and theme, this theme is part of an even greater story and growing concept I wish to work on for many years into the future, I have pages of concept work and creative writing and sketches and many deep thoughts on the fantasy surrounding this, as well as years of my life in building out these scenes with a backlog of various 3d scenes I have built. I live to build and create\n\nI'm a technical 3D Artist almost 20 years. https://youtu.be/TgXGq\\_8esw0?t=188 my previous handle in Decentraland was \"Mike Dent\" have been building, investing, promoting Decentraland since end 2017 non stop\n\nI work intense and prefer deep quality and passion over fast production/ promotion and fast sales. This is honest work\n\nIt was not meant to be combined with anything else but was only broken into sections as a compromise to work with the wearable tool. The pricing is high and quality is my best to date, I have spent many months intensively working on this master build which has my new branding for my best dark creative work  &ndash; &ldquo;Dark Horse Builds&rdquo; it is my type R badge.\nI request this character to be listed as layer 1 on Ethereum and sold as bundle set only on opensea for Mana on the Ethereum network.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BijrGZiJrIA\nhttps://twitter.com/cybermike4/status/1407497212951662599/photo/1\nhttps://twitter.com/cybermike4/status/1412517950003744770/photo/1\n\n- Yes to Cybermike's Build \"Idoru\" on Eth\n- No to Cybermike's Build \"Idoru\" on Eth\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1bbf4ba0-de9f-11eb-815a-1f002ccf0372)**",

    "title": "Should we convert 1/5th of the DAO&rsquo;s MANA to stablecoin to diversify and stabilize the treasury?",
    "body": "> by 0x4837f2542050744faf8215a5c401b86a01b6b91d\n\n**Summary**\n\nGiven the amount of MANA owned by the Decentraland DAO, we should diversify these holdings between Decentraland's native token (MANA) and stable coins to make the DAO&rsquo;s treasury more secure.\n\n***The DAO should allocate one-fifth (1/5) of the treasury, or `6,115,643` MANA, to a portfolio of stable coins including equal proportions of USDT, USDC, and DAI.***\n\nThe added stability resulting from this diversification will better empower the DAO to fulfill its various financial obligations (e.g. the community grants program) over a longer period of time.\n\nWhile the formation of a DAO Treasury Committee might result in a more complex and performant financial strategy, this initial proposal aims to suggest a simple change that our community can make right now to immediately help to protect and sustain the DAO's funding.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nOn February 20, 2020, the Decentraland DAO was created and given 222 million MANA by means of a 10 year vesting contract. (Sign into Metamask or connect your wallet to view the DAO's [vesting dashboard](https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac).) This MANA was set aside to support the continued development of the Decentraland platform by funding  decisions made by MANA holders and LAND owners through the DAO.\n\nAs of the time this proposal was published, `30,578,217` of that MANA has vested, and is now available to the DAO's treasury.\n\nIt is risky for the DAO to keep only MANA (its native governance token) in its treasury. To help guarantee that the treasury's balance remains wisely managed, the DAO's treasury should diversify across bluechip assets (e.g. ETH or BTC), stablecoins (e.g. DAI or USDC), and other assets such as a DeFi index (DPI) which may enable the DAO to earn yield.\n\nSpreading the DAO's holdings across these different assets will help to stabilize the DAO's entire treasury in the face of market fluctuations.\n\nMaintaining a stable treasury is a critical step toward enabling the DAO to fulfill its obligations to the Decentraland community, e.g. grants. The recently approved [Grants Framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=b265e3e0-bcb0-11eb-a871-a927ffd81f49) specifies that each grant is to be paid in MANA, according to the exchange rate between USD and MANA at the time of the transaction.\n\nMaintaining a cushion of stable coins within the treasury will help to maximize the number, size, and duration of grants that the DAO can fund in the long term.\n\nMany other DAOs are beginning to explore initiatives such as this, as is discussed in [this article and the related report](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/dao-treasury-balance-sheet-management-ce5e96da34ac) from the Blockchain Capital blog.\n\n*\\*\\*In conclusion, the DAO should exchange 1/5th of its treasury (or `6,115,643` MANA) for a portfolio of stable coins containing equal proportions of USDT, USDC, and DAI. \\*\\**\n\nThe remaining 4/5ths of the treasury will remain in MANA.\n\n**Specification**\n\n1/5th of the DAO's existing treasury, or `6,115,643` MANA, is to be exchanged for USDC, USDT, and DAI stable coins, with to the following distribution:\n\n*   `2,038,547.66` USDC\n*   `2,038,547.66` USDT\n*   `2,038,547.66` DAI\n\nThe transaction is to be conducted by the DAO Committee's multisig, requiring the signature of all three members.\n\n**For**\n\nApprove the proposed asset allocation and delegate the transaction to the DAO Committee.\n\n**Against**\n\nReject the proposed asset allocation.\n\n- For\n- Against\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=69b89db0-de87-11eb-815a-1f002ccf0372)**",

    "body": "> by 0x42b23bb838525d458f2b8109219ef45d229067b7 (WaifuWonderland)\n\nSo, my argument is that sandbox's world map has a huge advantage over our own and that we should consider implementing our own variation to DCL, specifically i'm referring to the ability for users to upload pictures ( often affiliated logos ) that represent who they are on the parcel map for all to see in a quick and intuitive way, feel free to go to https://www.sandbox.game/en/map/ if you havn't done so in the past to get a good idea. I feel that NFT's and images symbolizing various tribal groups often found within the blockchain environment  ( BoredApes anyone ? ) will become even more pervasive overtime, 2 days ago sandbox had a 24x24 landsale of over 830k usd shattering all previous records and the game isn't even out really, it is fast becoming a serious competitor.\\\nSo aside from what i've said, i understand people will be against clutter on the map, so my proposition is to only allow users to upload an image to the world map after they have combined an estate equal to or in excess of 2x2 and that pictures would scale according to the following pattern 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, etc. ) this will be an obvious driver to the economy once people are keen to begin collecting several parcels of land and brandish their Logos in the metaverse, and last but not least.. with so much of the metaverse being tied to NFT's, isn't using an NFT( just an image ) as the main advertising medium an obvious conclusion? I understand that there will be issues with user generated content that will require a small amount of administration ( often explicit material is filtered by bots and never uploaded by bad actors so i believe the threat is low, and worst case scenario the dao will act accordingly in the future ). I hope that after deliberation you will see the numerous advantages this map layout will have on user experience in DCL and i hope you vote for! thank you for your time!\n\ntl'dr : Should people with Estates in Excess of 2x2 be allowed to upload Images to the world map that identify their Affiliation.\n\n- I'm AGAINST DCL adding Pictures/Logos/UserImages to ANY Parcels!\n- I'm FOR DCL adding Pictures/Logos/UserImages to Parcels equal to or in Excess of 2x2\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=bd8590f0-dce9-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b)**",

There are many amazing content creators who I believe bring an important piece to our community and growing it, and hope you believe The Decentraland Report is one of them!\n\nWhile working a full time job in technology, I've used any free time the last 6 months to grow The Decentraland Report.

    "title": "Enhance All Builder Smart Items Feedback Cues; Improve Triggers, Counters, Text",
    "body": "> by 0xbd5b79d53d75497673e699a571afa85492a2cc74 (DecentralandGod)\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nEnhance Builder smart items enough so they are capable of creating scene-size dynamic games like Pong or Breakout.  There are 254 smart items found in the Builder.  Some are +2 years old, most checked in and never touched again.  I will revisit all the smart items and add functionality where lacking.\n\nSummary of work:\n\n*   Add more dynamic functionality to a targeted subset of smart items: Trigger Type, Counter Type, Text Displaying Types, Toolbox\n*   Improve user feedback by adding enabling/disabling clickable + customizable hover text feature\n*   Make the smart item code more scene efficient by reducing re-creation of objects where not needed\n\n#### Demo / POC\n\nhttps://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/badd0bda-4f80-4372-af4d-092841097557\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xbd5b79D53D75497673e699A571AFA85492a2cc74\n\n## Description\n\nFull Project Proposal Here https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/blob/master/proposals/all-smart-items-prop.md\n\n### Adding more dynamic functionality for the very specific subset of smart items\n\n##### Trigger Types\n\nIncludes: Trigger Area, Trigger Round, Trigger Tile SciFi, Trigger Tile Square\n\nI want to upgrade the code to the trigger system code found https://github.com/decentraland/decentraland-ecs-utils.   This upgrade will extend the current user entered/exited triggers.  It will add the ability to detect when objects interact with other objects and also define what objects can interact with other objects.  Interact here means when the bounds of 2 trigger boxes intersect with each other.  An example: Food is triggered (or eaten) by both cats or mice. Also, mice are eaten by cats, so a mouse's trigger area is triggered by only cats (not the food or other mice).\n\n##### Counter Types\n\nIncludes: Scoreboard, Countdown timers\n\nScoreboard for example, only when the target value is reached can it trigger an event.  Define more triggerable events as the counter is incremented or decremented.  Events such as trigger when increments by 1, nears the target value, reset etc..\n\n##### Text Displaying Types\n\nIncludes: Plain Text, Galleries\n\nBe able to change the text, font, color by an action event\n\n##### Toolbox Add Bounce Action\n\nToolbox currently manages object motion.  To be able to get dynamic movement more at least one more action needs to be added.  Bounce will take the current motion and calculate its bounce off an object/bounds.  It will calculate the most basic bounce trajectory of an object and purely reflect the direction.  It will not consider the object's mass, shape or rotation at the point of collision.  If it is possible to gain access to the object's shape and mass to determine a better angle and a more realistic bounce this will be a stretch goal.\n\nBounce will have a few parameters like \" elasticity\" or how bouncy the collision is.  It can either dampen the bounce or speed it up.\n\n### Make smart items more scene efficient.\n\n##### Add more user feedback\n\nThe user feedback on smart items is not very flexible or lacking (see General Audit provided below).   If they do have onClick events many times the hover text cannot be changed.  I want to add onClick events to more of the smart items as well as additional configuration abilities like changing the hover text.\n\n##### Some examples of better user feedback:\n\nThe Fantasy Black Button text says \"Press\" and cannot be changed to \"Press to open door\" for example.  Or if the builder chooses not clickable at all that is not possible either.\n\nThe Blender smart item is clickable but the hover text is not changeable it just says \"Interact\".  Would it not be more fun if the hover text could be changed to \"Make smoothie\".  Or if the builder chooses not clickable at all that is not possible either.\n\nThe Trapdoor is not clickable nor has hover text.  While that is likely because it is supposed to be a secret trap door what if someone wants it to have this ability.  Make clickable with hover text \"Open secret door\"\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Demo / POC\n\nYou can see the work I started here\n\nhttps://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/badd0bda-4f80-4372-af4d-092841097557\n\n### General Audit\n\nYou can see here an audit of all smart items and the features proposed to be added.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VB-4osSEVUW0AobdsLCokq-j6wCve9Aytam5wYyZlag/edit?usp=sharing.\n\n*   Name (Column B) gives the smart item name\n*   Existing Actions/Parameters (Columns C thru D)\n*   Audit of features existing or to be added (Columns G thru P)\n\nThis is a preliminary audit.  What features are listed in the audit document are subject to change.\n\n71 of the smart items (see General Audit provided above) do not reuse objects where possible.  Each instance of the same smart item re-creates the same object for each instance.  This directly impacts the weight smart items put on your scene when you add many of them.  It should be created once and reused instead.\n\n### Deliverables\n\nThe code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce.  The reasoning for the name of the repository: \"smart-items\" since that is what they are and \"ce\"  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip(s) that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/\n\nI will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so all these changes will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI already have one successful approved grant with delivered content. Below are the links to the previous grant, demo scene, and work delivered.  All of this proves I have the experience and skills required for working with smart items\n\n*   Past Grant: https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=ba798f30-d382-11eb-b705-3db38bad850a.\n*   Demo: https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce\n*   Deliverables:  https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce\n\nI won first place in the recent CyberPunk Contes that included a mini-game.  In the mini-game, I had to disable access to areas, disable platforms, keep track of how many times a user did something.  I exclusively used the Builder and the provided smart items to make my scene.  In doing so I am very familiar with the Builder and smart item current limitations.\n\nhttps://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/cyberpunk-2021-meet-the-winners/\nScene here https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20\n\nYou can see my pull request to fix a bug found in the CyberPunk image cube item.\nhttps://github.com/decentraland/smart-items/pull/27\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### Time to Complete\n\nI estimate roughly 10-weeks until completion from the time the proposal is accepted, there are a lot of items to go through, 254 to be exact (and sadly this is not my full-time job...yet! :).  Should the funding be approved I will start working and make it available as outlined in the deliverables above.\n\n### Status / Progress Communication\n\nThe status will be communicated twice a month through this grant forum.   See \"Discuss in the Forum\" link.   I also have my github repo which will track progress\n\n*   Committed Code https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/\n*   Project Work: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/projects/1\n*   Status: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/wiki/Status:-Enhance-All-Builder-Smart-Items\n\n### Milestones\n\n*   Week 1-10 - Make smart items more scene efficient + Add more user feedback (Burn rate of ~25 a week)\n*   Week 1-2 - Trigger Types + Toolbox Bounce Action\n*   Week 2-3 - Counter types + Display Text types\n*   Week 4-6 - Making a Game Demo Scene using Triggers and Counters.  A smattering of other updated items\n\nWeek deliverables tentative but give general delivery order\\*\n\n### Deliverables\n\nThe code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=ab782cf0-dace-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b)**",

    "title": "Should Voter Power Delegation be activated in Decentraland&rsquo;s Snapshot Space?",
    "body": "> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)\n\n**Overview**\n\nOn May 25, 2021, a poll was created suggesting the activation of VP delegation in Decentraland&rsquo;s Snapshot Space. The poll received **68% (4,322,367 VP) voting YES** (in support of VP delegation) and **32% (2,065,731 VP) voting NO** (in opposition to VP delegation). [You can view the original poll here.](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=fc6f60a0-bdb5-11eb-8849-33c326fb5301)\n\nHowever, due to the subsequent debate within the community, the DAO Committee recommended postponing the activation of VP delegation to allow for continued discussion. The Committee also called for the creation of a summary of the pros and cons of VP delegation to help inform voters leading up to this second, and final, poll in the DAO deciding whether or not to activate VP delegation.\n\nPlease carefully review this [report on the potential impacts of VP delegation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1idxYsKqnpwH5IuwiCNE5Wu3AwXqGTNzilyqjK5M-S5Q/edit?usp=sharing) before casting your vote.\n\n**Specification**\n\nActivating VP delegation in Decentraland&rsquo;s Snapshot Space would allow users to delegate their voting power to any address in one of two ways:\n\n1.  Via Snapshot&rsquo;s UI at **<https://snapshot.page/#/delegate>**\n2.  With a smart contract by calling the &lsquo;setDelegate&rsquo; method\n\nDelegating VP in Snapshot requires an on-chain Ethereum transaction, which incurs a gas fee.\n\nVP delegation in Snapshot is not transitive, and a user who has delegated VP to another wallet can still vote with their own VP on any proposal at any time.\n\nMore details on how delegation is implemented in Snapshot can be found in the [Snapshot documentation](https://docs.snapshot.org/guides/delegation).\n\n**Benefits**\n\n*   Helps to mitigate the risks of voting with LAND stored in cold (hardware) wallets\n*   Allows LAND stored in smart contracts to contribute VP to votes\n*   Allows users to empower trusted subject matter experts\n\n**Risks**\n\n*   Increases the risk that VP will be bought and sold\n*   Concentrates VP to a smaller number of wallets, increasing the risk of making difficult-to-reverse decisions\n*   Increases the risks of community grants fraud\n\n**For**\n\nActivate VP delegation in Decentraland&rsquo;s Snapshot Space\n\n**Against**\n\nDo not activate VP delegation in Decentraland&rsquo;s Snapshot Space\n\n- For\n- Against\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=d43c1e50-daa9-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b)**",

With a grant, I will secure a location, use my designer to create the store front, and begin advertising my services using the rentable ad spaces on decentraland, as well as advertise my services on social media. My plan is to help decentraland grow by accomodating it's players with unique avatar wearables and items as well as other unique nft items. I also, plan to utilize contests to gain traction and support customer retention to ensure sustainability of my enterprise. Thank you all for this amazing opportunity. Let's create together!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xeFd13F676744a527B1adce0b3c05834a54640ca8\n\n## Description\n\nMy project will solve the problem of players not having any personal or private events to attend on the space by giving them an avenue to use themes to host an event, and my project solves the problem of not having anything to wear when they can not find themed wardrobes for their guests, or when they do not have the means to create their own wardrobes and need them sooner than later. Basically, I will be like the company \"Party City\" in that I will cater to that segment of the player population that has or wants to create events to celebrate.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo complete my project, I will use my designer to create the storefront, and then I will use he and our team to complete the orders that come in from the players. Our team uses blender software and we have a very talented pool of creative individuals to drive our goals forward.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI will use the billion day studios to reach my targets. They are proficient in blender, 3d modelling, 3d rendering, 3d animation, 3d design, After Effects, Graphic design, Auto CAD, Maya, CAD/RAM, Building Architecture, Interior Design, Caricature and cartoons, and animation.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nI plan to report all of my progress to the community on a daily basis via the discord community channel. The roadmap is that I plan to have this operation completed in just over a month. The first week after receiving the grant, I will scout for land prospects. As soon as I have found one which I deem suitable as the prime location for my store front, I will move to secure the property. Once the scouting and purchasing phase is completed, and assuming this is in the first week, the next phase is to get my building design onto the location. So, the next week will be spent on interior design and testing the facility, as well as running advertisements to get attention to the store. The following two weeks will be the opening ceremony with contest giveaways and giveaways of avatar items to the first 100 visitors. During those two weeks, I will ramp up advertising on social media as well. This is the roadmap to bring my idea to fruition on decentraland.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=c5849560-d9e9-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b)**",

    "body": "> by 0xc1b8662a68f3eb66bc5e5c4de7c1ef04dc344d53 (Patmacs)\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nI've been building in DCL for half a year now and I have been very active in the community discord. I'm constantly helping everyone that I can, as we all figure out how to be better developers together. I have over 20 years of coding experience, including 6 years in blockchain specific development. I'm proficient in APIs, DBs, servers, solidity, server architecture, blender, photoshop, react, js, ts, ect.\n\nI'm a strong advocate for sharing not only what I've learned, but also the tools that I've built to make my own development easier. I want to share it all.\n\nAs of yesterday, I've released an early build of the tools for the community - https://github.com/pmacom/dclconnect\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xc1b8662A68F3eb66bC5e5C4DE7C1EF04Dc344d53\n\n## Description\n\nYou'll be able to easily:\n\n*   Place good looking (and performant) highlight boxes\n*   Add holdable/intractable items that will make GAME making so much easier\n*   Animate UIImage and UIText with ease. fadeTo, moveTo, scaleTo, ect.\n*   Inventory system for displaying details about your holdable items\n*   Storage system for placing entities into containers easily\n*   Debug tools for placing items in the game, instead of saving and refreshing often\n*   Audio/Video sound GUI for your parcel users to adjust volumes for individual audio sources.\n*   Experience bars that animate when the value is updated\n*   Much much more.\n\nRequests for common problems can be added to the github issue queue for my repo. I'm slowly adding in all of the things I've built. This obviously takes a large amount of time, and I'm doing it for free. Please consider this proposal. What I have already provided should benefit the community already, with some extra mana funds I'll be able to purchase some more land for testing out more interesting experiments which will also be rolled back into the community library I've created.\n\nPlease visit farm (DecentraFarm) to see many of these elements working together (It's still a work in progress obviously)\nhttps://play.decentraland.org/?position=0%2C-1\\&realm=unicorn-blue\n\nAlso visit my comedy/bar venue (TheBlock) - (Also a work in progress)\nhttps://play.decentraland.org/?position=-18%2C-122\\&realm=unicorn-blue\n\n\n## Specification\n\nI'm going to set up a semantic version control for the project very soon. Other contributors can submit pull requests to help strengthen the util library as a whole. I will maintain and update it regularly with whatever I build.\n\nVisit https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeV8zMwwclJX7Bf-JdxdJxw\nto see whats coming. Tutorial videos will be included for each component, as well as detailed documentation about implementation.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nPatmacs - I'm very active (maybe even annoyingly so) in the #SDK discord channel. I have over 20 years experience in web development, 18 years professionally. JS/TS, APIs, React, Blender, Photoshop, Solidity, ect. I've done it all probably. Hit me up in discord to test my knowledge/experience on a specific topic.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOver the next few weeks I'll be moving a lot of the code from DecentraFarm into TheBlock in anticipation of a formal grand opening.  This will be done by first adding each feature to the dclconnect npm library,  documenting the process, recording videos, and implementing them into the venue. This process drastically extends the release of my own venue. However, I believe it's worth the effort, if the community can find these tools useful.\n\nThe feature list is included in the Description.\n\nA second phase may include another batch of components/entities that are specifically requested by the community. It may require an additional grant to develop. I'm not quite sure yet.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=f227a8a0-d9b7-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b)**",

This would be presented as a fashion show with an after party inside Decentraland with some of europe, usa, hong kong and uks premier DJs.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2fdc5ec86B1744F8884D08FE404AC2F8612d3528\n\n## Description\n\nOur project is looking for funding as an independent real world art brand to be among the first to offer all of our real world pieces as Decentraland wearables. Making it possible to engage with our art in the metaverse and in the real world. We feel this will be a blueprint for the streetwear community bridging their creations to Decentraland. We know that as a  independent designer with conviction we want to spread our vision across every known universe even the parallel. In addition to the wearables and art we will bring the music that is a major cultural part of the brand dna. Having already worked on real world events with artists like Seth Troxler, Martinez Brothers, A$AP Rocky, and some of the best DJs from Berlin to London to Hong Kong and Brazil we see an after party as the best way to bring the vision into the full audio visual experience by recruiting a nice lineup of artists to share a great event with the Decentraland community to celebrate with ALIVE AND MORE\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe wearables will be by the designer and artist behind ALIVE AND MORE Karl Phenom ( http://instagram.com/karlphenom\nHaving the first hand experience in the construction and design of the original real world pieces will make executing the Decentraland wearables with as much authenticity possible a key in the results of the works.\n\nFor the After party event we plan to stream live video of Djs performing from around the world at their respective studios using OBS Studio and RTMP-Server.com as seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBDf-dR7DU\n\nWhile the aim will be to live stream the dj sets we may or may not accept pre-recorded video of the performances and then stream them live at the event for the first time to the community\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nKarl \"Phenom\" Jouanni based in Ibiza, Spain aka the Illustrious one the Art Creative Director, Designer and Founder of ALIVE AND MORE and TEAM RELMS ( https://screenshot-media.com/the-future/fashion/alive-and-more/ )  will head the majority of the wearable designs using Photoshop, Blender, Unity and Maya. This will involve converting the artwork from the real world ALIVE AND MORE pieces to the  Decentraland wearables.  We will recreate each piece to give the community a chance to make their avatars as \"fly\" as possible in ALIVE. You can see here on http://instagram.com/aliveandmore and http://instagram.com/teamrelms the many examples of avatars created with Alive pieces as their skins/clothing.\n\nMehdi Sultani Producer bases in Melbourne Australia will head the logistics and planning for the event. Working alongside the Djs and artists the primary task will be curating the list of djs/artists then setting up/ securing each studio spaces for the performances to live stream record from. Organising scheduling stream times and running this through to the decentraland event space. Our site for this will be here https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-86%2C-93\\&realm=fenrir-amber\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur estimated time line will be to launch the first collection event on September 11th 2021 to coincide with the beginning of FASHION WEEK Spring Summer 22 in NYC . This would give us 1 Month to develop and design the full collection. 1 Month to design and develop our Decentraland showroom experience to unveil the wearables and offer them on the marketplace.  We offer the community to buy/sell/ collect and with some proposed gamified elements we will introduce the opportunity to win the ALIVE wearables.  Following the launch we will then throw the after party event 3 weeks later as a completion to the first Alive Decentraland Fashion week season offering. We will invite the community to enjoy the live music and show off their wearables and how they chose to combine them with their looks and avatars if they did get a chance to grab one. As well this will be another opportunity to buy/sell/ trade Alive wearables. With a successful launch we can be an example the inspires all creatives to bring their real world designs to Decentraland wearables.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=1d5c5260-d813-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b)**",

I have been moderating it since.\n\nI noticed a one-stop-shop knowledge base was missing, so I took the initiative to learn and create this website to educate myself and everyone else who shared the same questions. Ranging from the explanation of claiming your username, to the world map, to districts, wearables, and even fun things to do in DCL!\n\nAfter getting a vote of confidence from DCL admin, \"Toonpunk\", (who loved the website), here I am! :)\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n2,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x6ae03D1d3A9b161ec264C76AD73999EE25AbEC5a\n\n## Description\n\nSince April, my Decentraland, all-in-one free guide (https://letsdodefi.com/decentraland-guide) has received thousands of views, and has received awesome feedback with requests for me to update it.\n\nI have been fairly busy and haven't updated it in a month or so, and so I figured a financial grant could align me to maintain and moderate this awesome knowledge base.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nI have completed the core of this project already:\n(https://letsdodefi.com/decentraland-guide) , but I plan to add some CSS to polish it up, and then continue to moderate it indefinitely :)\n\nI use Notion hosted on Super, which I pay for myself. And I do the CSS polishing myself during my spare time.\n\nI think updating this resource is crucial to onboarding the masses into our metaverse.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI am a one-man-army here. I am and will be working on this all alone, as I enjoy doing it and learning more about DCL.\n\nI am a DeFi content creator who documents and educates others who are intimidated by the space. I aim to make guides and content that anyone can understand, which casts a wide net to help onboard non-techy people even.\n\nMy YouTube:  https://youtube.com/c/DefiDonut\nMy DeFi education site: https://letsdodefi.com/\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/thekriskay/\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nSince the website is already up and running, I will be responsible for:\n\n*   Updating it with new content as DCL evolves\n*   Add a \"DAO votes\" section that explains new votes that passed.\n*   Polish it a tiny bit with some CSS\n\nI am in the DCL discord and in communication with a few admins.\nI have no problem reporting updates there.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=ed3849d0-d804-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b)**",

    "body": "> by 0x0e80fdfd9e13c90179ab2069bd288bd32826c499 (troysadkowsky#c499)\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nDecentrapolooza will be a regular Decentraland convention event that allows citizens of Decentraland to gather together as artists, technologists, gamers and innovators.\n\nThe event will provide structured speaker panel sessions as an opportunity to present past, present and future projects and topics of interest.\n\nThe event will invite high profile individuals from industries such as academia, business and entertainment to participate as guests and panelists.\n\nWith a focus on decentralisation the event will celebrate the experimental application of technology in a virtual world that is limited only by imagination.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 MANA\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x0E80Fdfd9e13C90179AB2069BD288BD32826c499\n\n## Description\n\nThe recent pandemic has emphasised the growing need for virtual events.  By merging video conference calls with virtual world convention halls, stages and lecture theatres, this project will increase the intimacy of a virtual event in a new and entertaining environment.\n\nMany global events are now transitioning from physical conference halls to online video conference calls, but video calls fail to deliver the same atmosphere.  This project will showcase as a bridging platform to allow global events to transition to a more virtual environment that delivers opportunities that online video calls lack.  These opportunities include aspects like the ability to virtually meet up with friends between sessions, ability to move from one session to another halfway through, ability to see hot spots of participation and even allow the elderly, physically impaired and underprivileged communities to be involved in something that would otherwise be impossible for them to participate in.\n\nThe event will be hosted by Decentraland and run over 1 day in a format similar to a Pop Culture fandom based convention such as ComicCon (US) or SuperNova (AUS).  The day will consist of an opening plenary, multiple streams of parallel panel sessions, workshops and a closing plenary.  The streams of panel sessions will bring groups of panelists (2 to 5) together to discuss a single broadly defined topic from a list of categories.  Categories will include areas such as Gaming, Content Development, Platform Development and Community Development.\n\nThis project will also aim to build academic interest.  By collecting and making data available for research purposes (such as the text transcription of all panel sessions) the project allows for spin-off data science studies.  For example, with the application of machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (such as Natural Language Processing (NLP)) data scientists may analyse all the session's text transcriptions to perform topic classification.  Topic classification may be able to identify common points of interest and proposed solutions throughout the whole event.  These studies could provide great insight into best directed future developments in Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis project will depend heavily on open source and shared resources accessible from the GitHub repositories and Decentraland community.  The approach will be to utilise what is already available before building anything new.\n\nThe University District and its already established structures such as Decentraland University and Learning Spheres, will make for a suitable location to run this event, though some additional development is foreseen as necessary.\n\nA small research study will be performed to identify the feasibility of all existing reusable resources for this event.  The outcome of the research study will report a detailed plan of implementation using agile and iterative development methodologies.\n\nNecessary modifications and additions to scenes/features will be developed through the Decentraland SDK and 3D modelling software (such as Blender).  This project will contribute to the open-source code repositories.\n\nAlready identified existing [GitHub](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes) resources include:\n\n*   Wearables-store\n*   Crypto-valley-art-gallery\n*   Clap-meter\n*   POAP-Booth\n*   Nft-scanner\n*   Ws-broadcast\n*   Switchboard-platforms\n*   Grab-objects\n*   Guest-Book-API\n*   Beer-dispenser\n*   Donations-Box\n*   Paid-Button\n*   Paid-Lever\n*   Sliding-door\n*   Npc-dialog-example-scene\n*   Events-API\n*   Digital-bouncer\n*   Basic-Interactions\n*   Grab-objects-advanced\n*   discordWebsocket\n*   Nft-wall-example-scene\n\nExperience has been gained in using the SDK and deploying dcl scenes to local development environments.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThis project will be managed by [Troy Sadkowsky](https://www.google.com/search?q=troy+sadkowsky), CTO and Data Scientist at [Data Logical Services Pty Ltd](https://datalogicalservices.com/).  Troy is a native data scientist and the owner of the Data Scientist group on LinkedIn which currently has over 100,000 members.  Troy is also a full-stack Java developer with extensive experience in npm and TypeScript programming.  He is moderately skilled in 3D modelling with Blender.\n\nWith the successful award of this grant, a small team of enthusiastic technologists will be assembled and given necessary roles and responsibilities in order to achieve the project goals.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMonth 1 - Planning Phase\nMonth 2 - Development Phase\nMonth 3 - Trial and Promotion Phase\n\nPlanning phase will involve the recruitment of the team, the execution of the research study into reusable resources for this event and the documentation of the overall event management plan.  Milestone deliverables include the public release of the event management plan.\n\nDevelopment Phase will involve the design and development of any additional components to be deployed to the scenes in Decentraland.  Milestone deliverables include the announcement and deployment of any new Decentrapolooza scenes/features.\n\nTrial and Promotion Phase will involve testing and running trial/rehearsal events to identify any issues and establish confidence for all stakeholders before the actual event is run.  This phase will also involve the execution of numerous marketing campaigns to promote the event.\n\nAll phases will include research and investigation into ongoing funding opportunities, such as charging for tickets/exhibitor booths and getting support from paying sponsors.\n\nAll progress related to the phases and milestones will be regularly reported openly on social networking platforms such as YouTube, Discord, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=48bf44c0-d4d1-11eb-8686-d3654af1f4cd)**",

    "title": "Improving the Toolbox Smart Item In Builder",
    "body": "> by 0xbd5b79d53d75497673e699a571afa85492a2cc74 (DecentralandGod)\n\nShould the following Tier 2: a one-time payment of $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd more functionality to the toolbox smart item to enable users to make more dynamic scenes\n\nI will list the updates and then provide more detail below\n\n*   Add a set of \"Face Player/Item\" and \"Move to Player/Item\"\n*   Add \"Follow path\"\n*   Improve the  Move/Rotate/Scale code (TweenSystem) to be able to run 1 move,1 rotate,1 scale concurrently. Currently limited where only 1 action can be executed at a time move or rotate or scale.\n*   Scene Add/remove\n*   Attach/Detach Item\n\n### Demo / POC\n\n\\[https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce] (https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce)\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 MANA\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xbd5b79D53D75497673e699A571AFA85492a2cc74\n\n## Description\n\nFull Project Proposal Here https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/blob/master/proposals/toolbox-ce.md\n\n### Actions To Be Added\n\n##### Face player\n\nThe target item will rotate towards the player at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player.\n\n##### Face Item\n\nThe target item will rotate towards the target item at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player\n\n##### Move to player\n\nThe target item will move towards the player who invoked it at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player\n\n##### Move to item\n\nThe target item will move towards the item at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player.\n\n##### Note on above\n\nAll of the above face/move actions will include lock X, Y, Z-axis which do as they suggest.  It will prevent movement along the locked axis.  This is useful if you wanted to move an item to the same Y coordinate as another item but update any other axis (basically have it move only in the up/down direction).\n\n##### Follow Item Path\n\nThe target item will follow a path of defined items.  This is like move to item however you list more than one item.  It will also not follow the path strictly but more of a curved path AND rotate the object-oriented facing forward along the path.  I do have a POC of this working however the Builder action UI is limited and I see no way to be able to pick an unlimited amount of items.   I must pre-configure the max number of selectable items.  I am also not sure how nicely this will work with multi-player.  I plan on leaving this just as an advanced feature only the CE repo will have and not try to pull it into the main repo.\n\n##### Motion Control\n\nAllows a player to pause, stop, resume an action\n\n##### Improve the Move/Rotate/Scale code (TweenSystem)\n\nCurrently, you can execute just one Rotation, Move, or Scale at a time.  Executing two at the same time will cancel one of them out.  I want to add the ability to enable 1 Rotation + 1 Move + 1 Scale all at the same time.    More than 1 of these actions at the same time will have the same cancelation effect as the first just like today but only against that action type: move, rotate or scale.\n\n##### Add Attach/Detach Item\n\nWill attach 1 item to another giving the attached item the position, rotation, scale of the target/host object.  This is very useful to move items in one group instead of individually.  Attach centered flag.\n\n##### Scene Add/remove\n\nAction will let you remove/add an object.  Not the most elegant way to handle the user experience object/movement but has its uses.  One is removed objects do not contribute to scene limitations and boost scene performance.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Demo / POC\n\nI started work the same day I saw the DAO Funding proposal as a POC and you can see the work I have completed here\n\n\\[https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce] (https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce)\n\nI estimate I have about 70% of the deliverable complete.   I am optimistic that this proposal will be approved because I believe in the value of adding the toolbox functionality (I have already logged more hours than I probably should have not knowing if this will be funded or not).  Should the funding be approved I will finalize my work and make it available as outlined in the deliverables below.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n### My Portfolio\n\nI won first place in the recent CyberPunk Contes that included a mini-game.  In the mini-game, I had to disable access to areas, disable platforms, keep track of how many times a user did something.  I exclusively used the Builder and the provided smart items to make my scene.  In doing so I am very familiar with the Builder and smart item current limitations.\n\nhttps://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/cyberpunk-2021-meet-the-winners/\nView it in the scene pool here \\[https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20] (https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20)\n\nI have made improvements to existing smart items.\\\nhttps://github.com/decentraland/smart-items/pull/27\n\nAnother contest submission for the Voxter Contest involved a smart asset they provided.  You can find my submission here:\nhttps://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/a1890011-77d7-415c-aeb2-452e3a186391?realm=localhost-stub.  Again I used the Builder and but this time also the SDK to enhance the Voxter smart item given to the contestants improving its experience and features in the Builder.  Enhancements can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/pabloes/voxters/pull/2\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### Time to Complete\n\nI am past the 70% completion mark already.  I estimate at most more 2-weeks until completion from the time the proposal is accepted (sadly this is not my full-time job...yet! :) ).  Should the funding be approved I will finalize the work I have already started and make it available as outlined in the deliverables above.\n\n### Deliverables\n\nThe code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here. https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce.  The reasoning for the name of the repository: \"smart-items\" since that is what they are and \"ce\"  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/\n\nI will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so it will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=ba798f30-d382-11eb-b705-3db38bad850a)**",

This is not a major issue however the further behind the builder gets the more issues may appear between what you see in Builder and what you see when deployed.\n\nFor example introduced in 6.6.4 there was a backwards breaking change.  \"There used to be a gimbal lock problem where going from Quaternion > Euler wasn't a symmetric conversion, so if you converted quaternion to euler and back you might not have the same angle\".  This was a fix that was needed however anything running the SDK before this fix may need to be adjusted to work correctly again.  There happened to be a few smart items using this function.   In the builder it looked OK because it did not have the latest SDK.  However when deployed it the rotation was not right.\n\nPatching the builder to the newer SDK will help keep the gap of issues like this to a minimum\n\n- Builder should be patched to latest SDK\n- Builder can remain on old SDK for now\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=72f3d560-d1f4-11eb-9861-ebb8fcfd58d2)**",

However I guess there are some moving parts I do not understand so,\nwhat about my hybrid idea? Allow anyone to mint warbles at anytime. Which will cost like $10+ mana gas fee per (approved wearables proposal) to @toonpunk23 team or whoever is doing the \"approving\" of Decentraland wearables. Plus the $100 to $200+ escrow mana like @DCLCurations was saying. That way it incentives faster approvals and feedback for non approvals to get approved.\n\nWe will call it the \"@DCLCurations - @AaronLeupp - @lastraum - @kevinonearth999 -@toonpunk23 - @Waifumons - @RealMattBond\n(Let the market buy what they want even if it is Wallmart/Kirkland quality Act) \"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AaronLeupp/status/1400614771502641153\n\n- Auto Approve and Allow all Wearables to be made ASAP!\n- No!

    "body": "> by 0x23be90335e79d3245615985d91f69814f98a0fab (Swiss)\n\nHow do you make people participate in the DAO voting system?\n\nCertainly not by making them feel like they have no chance of moving the needle in the first place.\n\nAt the same time, you can't take away voting power from people who have invested early on and are now considered small whales, to make the system fairer. So what do you do?\n\nWell, since name NFT owners have passed a vote to get voting points and landowners have voting power privileges - Why do wearables owners not have that?\n\nThe only reason that I can think of is that future L2 wearables minted on MATIC may be minted for a very low cost per NFT so those would not be a great measure of how invested their owners are in the game. This would incentivize spam wearables just to get VP. So that is out of the question, - for now. Future L2 MATIC wearables will not be included in this initiative.\n\nBut ETH Layer 1 wearables have a fixed supply (except for a few rewards still outstanding) and are well distributed across the community. Every wearable you own today is an L1 wearable.\n\nWhat if owning those would give you additional voting power?\n\nAfter all most of those were purchased, like names and lands. And those that were received as rewards prove active participation in the game and that should be worth something.\n\nYes, certain larger entities will gain some additional VP, too. But I believe the wider distribution of VP among the regular folks in Decentraland would increase the will to participate in the DAO and would better represent how invested someone is in the metaverse.\n\nI would suggest to first decide if we want that and then have a second poll on how to tier the system based on the rarity category of the items.\n\nWhat do you think?

    "body": "> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)\n\n**Overview**\n\nAs participation in the DAO increases and more proposals are submitted, there is an increased risk of approving malicious, spammy, or poorly-formulated proposals. To protect the DAO from such proposals being passed unknowingly, a minimum amount of participating VP should be required to vote in favor of a proposal in order for it to be passed and enacted.\n\nThis risk is especially relevant to community grants funded by the DAO. With the recent approval of [this grants framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=b265e3e0-bcb0-11eb-a871-a927ffd81f49), users will soon be able to request MANA to fund projects by means of one-time payments and vesting contracts.\n\nThe lack of a minimum VP needed to pass a vote combined with an increase in proposal submissions may result in many underqualified or fraudulent grants receiving approval. While the DAO Committee is responsible for initiating the transfer of funds for grants, the final approval for grants should come from a majority vote within the community, not the DAO Committee.\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe minimum VP participation required to approve a proposal may vary depending on the proposal category. Given the financial risk associated with community grants, the minimum should be higher for these proposals.\n\n*   A minimum of **1 million VP** should be required to vote **YES** on a grant request for it to be approved, if the YES votes have the majority\n*   A minimum of **500k VP** should be required to vote **YES** on POI additions, Name Bans, and Catalyst node additions for these actions to be enacted by the DAO, if the YES votes have the majority\n\nThese thresholds should be subject to change in future, as seen fit by the DAO.\n\nAs can be seen in recently approved POI additions this level of support is not difficult to reach, but still plays an important role in preventing unnoticed proposals from \"slipping through\" the DAO.\n\n**Benefits**\n\n*   Helps to ensure that enacted proposals more accurately reflect the sentiment of the greater community\n*   Helps to prevent the DAO from funding underqualified, poorly-formulated, or fraudulent grants\n*   Helps to ensure that high quality POIs are added\n*   Helps to prevent the addition of low-quality Catalyst nodes to Decentraland's network that might negatively impact users' experience\n*   Prevents abuse of the Banned Name list\n\n**For**\n\nImplement the described minimum VP participation needed to approve proposals.\n\n**Against**\n\nContinue allowing proposals to pass without a minimum VP participation.\n\n- For\n- Against\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=95141550-c3f4-11eb-b2bc-870b0f8c50b5)**",

    "body": "> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)\n\n**Summary**\n\nA proposal to the DAO to grant the Decentraland Foundation deployment permissions on Road parcels for the purpose of deploying content for public events like the upcoming Pride Parade.\n\n**Overview**\n\nDuring the initial development of the platform, roads were set aside as public spaces to aid content discovery and open exploration of the virtual world. Currently, all of the LAND parcels that make up public roads within Decentraland are owned by the Decentraland DAO. Only the DAO has the permissions to deploy content to these parcels.\n\nBy authorizing an externally owned account (EOA) operated by the Decentraland Foundation to become an \"update manager\" of the DAO's LAND and Estates, the Foundation would be able to deploy content and experiences for everyone to enjoy.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nEnabling the Decentraland Foundation to deploy content to public road parcels provides several benefits:\n\n*   Public events are increasing in popularity, boosted by the content built by the Decentraland Foundation. These events help to grow the Decentraland community and to build awareness and excitement for the entire platform. Increasing the LAND available to the Foundation would increase the reach and impact of these events.\n*   Specifically, the Decentraland Foundation is hosting a Pride Parade in June to celebrate and promote the rights of LGBTQ+ people and communities. As with physical Pride Parades, Decentraland's parade should be held on public roads. The Foundation needs access to these parcels to deploy the floats and decorations for the event.\n*   In addition to events, the Decentraland Foundation can use these deployment permissions to keep public roads up-to-date with interesting and engaging content.\n*   An example of another feature that the Foundation could deploy on roads is a tram system linking the major areas of the map. This tram system has already been built, and only needs to be deployed to public roads to make it available. [A demo of the tram system can be seen here.](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/DCL-trams/blob/main/README.md)\n\n**Specification**\n\nAssign an EOA owned by the Decentraland Foundation with the address `0x462ab09f1a75786E0c54ced394E0fB537Af03734` \"update manager\" permissions for all of the DAO's LAND and Estates.\n\nOwnership of these parcels would be maintained by the DAO, and the deployment permissions may be revoked from the Decentraland Foundation at any time via another vote in the DAO. Granting \"update manager\" permissions for the DAO's LAND to this EOA does not grant it the right to transfer or sell the DAO's LAND.\n\n- Grant the Foundation \"update manager\" permissions for the DAO's LAND and Estates\n- Deny the Foundation \"update manager\" permissions for the DAO's LAND and Estates\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=38cf5bb0-c322-11eb-ac84-1705d1ae4a66)**",

    "body": "> by 0xb5cde1c5b905892cf0873cc43fddb56c1738888f (Rednitrous18)\n\nThe new Wearable builder has been announced and with it the details for how collections get approved and minted. https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor/\nEarly on in the discussion of the wearable builder the Decentraland foundation said the new collections would go through a committee and a DAO vote before being able to be minted. This was to make sure the Wearables were compatible and able to work in world as well as having a quality control to make sure the collection was wanted in world ny the community.\n\nNow they have removed the DAO Vote from the process.\nWithout a vote by the community the ecosystem will be flooded by collections of wearables. Some issues that could arise from a lack of quality control and moderation:\n\n*   Low effort wearables (single image on a plane t-shirt)\n*   wearables with no community interest\n*   Major drop in value for all wearables\n*   flooded marketplace with low demand\n\nArtist should be able to express their creativity and fashion without destroying or disrupting the ecosystem. There also should be interest for new collections and not just collections being minted because one person wants a shirt or other wearable.\nFees for minting a collection can only do so much for moderation. If anything it only prices out artist.\n\nSo I call for a vote on whether or not new wearable collections should have a DAO vote before being minted.\n\nHappy to hear feedback or other ideas on the forum as there is always more ways to solve an issue.\n\n- Yes, needs Approval\n- No, no Approval\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=93c7e0f0-c31d-11eb-ac84-1705d1ae4a66)**",

    "title": "Revised proposal for wearable publication fees",
    "body": "> by 0x9982b469910c2ee2ea566dcfcc250cdd34056397 (MrEric)\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis is an updated version of a previous proposal for wearable publication fees. After receiving feedback and input from the community, the previous proposal has been updated to more accurately reflect the risk that a flood of NFT wearables poses to the platform.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Wearables Editor will allow community content creators to upload collections of the 3D models and textures needed to mint NFT wearables. Before these wearable collections may be minted, they will have to pass through a publication process - part of which includes content moderation and approval to vet out spam and submissions that violate Decentraland's Content Policy.\n\nHowever, there remains the risk that creators will submit an excessive volume of collections, and/or that collections will be submitted with low-quality content.\n\n**This introduces several very significant risks to the entire Decentraland platform:**\n\n*   A high volume of submissions will slow the approval process for other creators\n*   The Catalyst nodes that serve the content for Decentraland incur additional CPU, storage, and bandwidth costs for every wearable item added to the platform\n*   When exploring the world, users must download and render every custom wearable encountered\n*   Other dApps within the Decentraland platform must process every additional added item, negatively impacting their performance for users\n\nGiven the immutability of NFTs, wearables minted in Decentraland will be present forever. They cannot be removed. So, any detrimental effects they have on the performance of the platform cannot be removed.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, it is proposed that the DAO collect a publication fee for each item within a collection, regardless of the rarity selected when minting those items. *This fee is not applied to every NFT minted from each item, only the item.*\n\nThis fee will be transferred to the DAO and may help fund community grants, reimburse the Curation Committee for their work in vetting submissions, and other initiatives as seen fit by the community.\n\n**These fees can always be lowered or increased, but NFTs can never be removed from the platform.**\n\n**Benefits**\n\n*   Disincentivize creators from submitting spam, thus increasing the rate at which legitimate submissions are approved and published\n*   Promotes the submission of very high quality wearables\n*   Protects the Decentraland platform from a permanent drop in performance due to a flood of NFT wearables\n\n**Specification**\n\nEach time a creator submits a collection in the Wearables Editor for publication, they must pay a fee in MANA (at the rate decided on by the DAO) for each item. These fees are charged per item in a collection, not per NFT minted from an item.\n\nFor example, if an X MANA fee is approved by the DAO, the fees would be as follows.\n\n*   1 Unique item - 1 NFT - total minting cost X MANA\n*   1 Mythic Item - 10 NFTs - total minting cost X MANA\n*   1 Legendary Item - 100 NFTs - total minting cost X MANA\n*   1 Epic item - 1000 NFTs - total minting cost X MANA\n\n- 100 MANA\n- 500 MANA\n- Other\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=50092c00-c315-11eb-ac84-1705d1ae4a66)**",

According to https://catalyst-monitor.now.sh/, it is running the version #a7888ea, from beginning of April 2021, almost 2 months old.\n\n### Motivation :\n\nCatalyst nodes that are out of date or do not respond might pose security risks to any user of Decentraland that uses this node to download information. We should keep the list clean of servers that do not update frequently.\n\nSince that catalyst was last updated, serious protocol updates have been deployed by the other catalysts and having a catalyst lacking behind by that much is a real issue to implement new features and optimizations.\n\nThe owner of this catalyst doesn't communicate with the rest of the catalyst owners so coordination is not possible, they are also not technical enough to host a stable catalyst and hasn't installed the necessary tools (which expose metrics of the catalyst, for example) to ensure the stability of the network.\n\nOther catalysts are unable to pull any content from it, causing synchronization issues, frequent forks and issues for users to deploy content (as scenes are deployed to a random catalyst of the DAO approved list).\n\n### Choices:\n\n**For**: Removing \"decentraland.org.cn\" from the DAO Catalyst List\n\n**Against**: Keeping \"decentraland.org.cn\" in the DAO Catalyst List\n\n- For\n- Against\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=4c1d8e40-bfc5-11eb-8849-33c326fb5301)**",

Each DAO would own 50% of the pool, so $375K in tokens will need to be exchanged between the DAOs so each can manage $375K MANA & $375K $DG. The pool would be initialized with $1.5M in liquidity.\n\nQuickSwap can provide QUICK LP rewards as they do for the other two $DG pools on QuickSwap. Moreover, the pool will give DCL members a great opportunity to take part in the burgeoning Quickswap community and earn yield on MANA.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=32a29c50-be79-11eb-8849-33c326fb5301)**",

Implementing this feature would allow any player to delegate VP to another player by visiting the following link and entering another player's address and the space: snapshot.dcl.eth\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/delegate\n\nWhy would you want to delegate voting power to another player?\n\nThere are a few reasons a player may want to delegate VP. Many players I have spoken with tend to store their parcels in a separate address, typically a cold wallet, that lends operator rights to their playable (hot) address. This proposal is an effort to preserve the security of those assets while being able to exercise the voting power they represent.\n\nA second reason arises from the notion of proxying your vote. Not all players or asset holders will participate in proposal review and voting, especially as the number of proposals to the DOA grows. This proposal allows passive investors to exercise their VP by delegating it to players who have a shared vision for the future of Decentraland.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=fc6f60a0-bdb5-11eb-8849-33c326fb5301)**",

    "body": "> by 0x02dcce9e0aa57881dd15d09ad904c6ff93f0c059 (Krunch)\n\nHello community,\n\n**DISCLAIMER**:\nI propose this question with complete transparency that I own 100+ names myself and have a bias to this proposal. With that being disclosed, lets get to the details!\n\n**PROPOSAL**:\nNAME owners receive 100 VP per name owned. Just as MANA holders receive 1 for 1 VP per MANA, NAME holders (who put their MANA to work and also burn it out of existence) should receive 1 for 1 VP proportional to the cost of minting a name.\n\n**BACKGROUND**:\nCurrent DAO participants are MANA holders and LAND holders. LAND owners being granted 2,000 VP per land and MANA holders a 1 for 1 VP per MANA. As it shows, NAME owners currently hold no VP even though contributions to acquire names are arguably the most contributory to the state of Decentraland between the 3; minting a name requires the cost of 100 MANA (which is burnt out of existence!) as well as gas fees, which we all know can be outrageous at times.\n\nI will spare you all the argument of whether or not the minting cost of names should be lowered or not, but I will point out that compared to acquiring LAND, minting a name is dirt cheap. Not only does owning a NAME differentiate you from the flurry of \"User#1fj49\" Metaversers that populate Decentraland, but it is also a domain name -- which can be attached to a parcel (and a 1/1 NFT)!  I am not proposing this question as a means of adding extra utility to make my name investments sell better, but rather give those who do not have thousands of MANA to acquire LAND and also wish to have a unique identity in the next frontier of the internet, a say in how Decentraland progresses.\n\nGiven the recent major developments from the Decentraland dev team in how the DAO operates, I believe it will serve the community well to allow more members to participate in the direction of Decentraland. Since I joined the community a few months ago, I have learned that Decentraland is filled with so many helpful people -- whether it be a newcomer who has a plethora of questions, an up and coming NFT artist who is debuting their work, I have seen more examples than I can count with my fingers of instances of community members going out of their way to show support! Lets try and put more power into the little guys' hands that weren't here on Launch Day, but want to participate and don't have to feel like they are going against all odds when voting versus massive whales that can influence an entire vote themselves.\n\n- YES\n- NO\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=bc52d5c0-bd0a-11eb-8849-33c326fb5301)**",

Names are unique NFTs in Decentraland and allow users to identify themselves in the metaverse.\n\nAs you know when users claim a name via the builder for 100 Mana (+Gas) that it is a one time transaction and cannot be edited or customised after.\n\nNames can have letters and numbers as well as the option to use upper and lower case characters. I have noticed users will claim a name and not consider the lower and uppercase characters when minting their NFT.\n\nThis is not an issue as some users are allowed to to use lower and upper case characters in a variety of ways and combinations that they prefer. However, when users are buying claimed names from Decentraland Marketplace or secondary marketplaces like Opensea then they might find a name they want but the characterisation is messy and not clean. Some users may prefer a capital first letter on a name  or just an option to edit it how they want whereas some names have been claimed and minted in all lowercase (Example would be \"genisis plaza\" and \"Genisis Plaza\".\n\nI wanted to ask the community whether they think it would be beneficial to add a feature in builder where users who have claimed names can edit the capitalisation of letters (Upper and Lowercase). NOTE users will not be able to change the names letters and numbers or format (Order).\n\nAs a user of decentraland that has invested in name NFTs I think this would be good for those who cant claim a desired name but would like to buy a name and would still be able to edit it to their preference.\n\nVote in the poll below and if you have any suggestions then feel free to contact me.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal?id=5a89dbb0-bcc7-11eb-83da-d9722efc8034)**",

The goal is to ensure that grants have the scope, goals, planning, and appropriate funding needed to be successful.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nOne of the features to be added to the Decentraland DAO is community grants. These grants will use MANA owned by the DAO to help fund teams and/or individuals who want to create features or content for Decentraland. However, it is important to allocate the DAO's MANA judiciously for several reasons:\n\n1.  The DAO's MANA fund is limited\n2.  There are limits to what can realistically be built within the Decentraland platform\n3.  It is common ground that it is in the community's best interest to maintain the ability to fund a range of projects over a long period of time\n\nTo maximize the impact of the DAO's funds and to ensure the DAO gives funds to projects most likely to succeed (thus adding value to Decentraland for the entire community), grants should be constrained in size and category to make it easier for the community to review and vet proposals.\n\n**The proposed grant categories are:**\n\n*   Community\n*   Platform contributor\n*   Gaming\n\n**The proposed initial grant tiers are:**\n\n*   $500 - $1500 USD in MANA, one-time payment\n*   $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA, one-time payment\n*   $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, up to a 3 month vesting contract with a one month cliff\n\n**Specification**\n\nFor a full description of this proposed Grants Framework, [please see this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YDzmJTiDmr2rhIbSABUmuag0\\_poddC7tt192M-3ZitA/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n**For**\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation will implement these grant categories and tiers into the DAO proposal submission process by means of pre-designed forms. Only grant applications within the above described framework will be funded through the DAO.\n\n**Against**\n\nDo not use the grants framework described in this proposal to limit funding provided to projects through the DAO. (Note: if this proposed framework is rejected by the DAO, an alternative framework may be proposed pending feedback and discussion within the community.)\n\n- For\n- Against\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal?id=b265e3e0-bcb0-11eb-a871-a927ffd81f49)**",
