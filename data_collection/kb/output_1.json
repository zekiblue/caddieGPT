    "body": "> by 0xd4f1cab694c4424c4796549edbb9b489789f4df5 (TudaMoon)\n\n### Overview\n\nThis proposal outlines the transition from the current grant system to a bounty-based system, aiming to enhance efficiency and community engagement in achieving project milestones. This would make the goals community driven. Then as a community everyone can work on achieving the goals one milestone at a time. The best part, everyone gets paid upon completion of a milestone and everyone has the same opportunity to complete it.\n\n### Stage 1: Proposal Submission and Bounty Creation\n\n*   **Purpose:** Initiate projects with clearly defined objectives and structured paths to completion.\n*   **Details:**\n    *   Proposals must include:\n        *   **Goals**: The final outcome expected from the project.\n        *   **Milestones**: Specific tasks required to achieve the goal, with associated costs and deadlines for each (up to 3 months total).\n        *   **Technical Requirements**: Detailed specifications for each milestone to ensure clarity and feasibility.\n\n### Role of Technical Auditor\n\n*   **Function**: Works in conjunction with the Grant Support Squad to evaluate the technical sufficiency of milestone submissions.\n*   **Process**:\n    *   Reviews submissions against the milestone's technical requirements.\n    *   Advises the Grant Support Squad on whether submissions meet the set standards.\n\n### Bounty Completion and Rewarding\n\n*   **Participation**: Open to all. Each participant or team can tackle the specified milestones.\n*   **Reward System**:\n    *   Bounties are paid only upon successful completion and approval of a milestone.\n    *   If multiple submissions are received by the deadline, the most suitable one, as determined by the Technical Auditor and Grant Support Squad, is chosen.\n    *   If the deadline is missed, the bounty is awarded to the first team that completes the milestone adequately.\n\n**Note**: This bounty system replaces the old grant system. It is designed to ensure that contributions are not only timely but also meet the expected quality standards, fostering a competitive yet collaborative environment.\n\n### Enacted\n\nIf this proposal is passed, it would update to a bounty based system where all can participate. It would also create a new position for the DAO called Technical Auditor which would work with the Grant Support Squad. All the details above will be enacted.\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Create new Grant Revocation Category for DAO",
    "body": "> by 0xd4f1cab694c4424c4796549edbb9b489789f4df5 (TudaMoon)\n\n### Problem\n\nCurrently, a grant is passed in 1 round of voting by the DAO. However, if the DAO wants to revoke the grant, it takes 3 rounds of voting through the governance system.\n\n### Solution\n\n### Revocation Category\n\nCreate a category specific for the DAO to revoke grants. This category would require only 1 round of voting to revoke a grant. Once a grant is revoked by the DAO, the grant cannot be reinstated. The author of the proposal to revoke must include a detailed reasoning and evidence.\n\n### Category Requirements\n\n**Voting Period:** 168 hours (7 days).\n**Quorem:** 4 Million VP\n**Submission Threshold:** 1,000 VP\n\n### Repetitive Submissions\n\nOne proposal to revoke a specific grant can only be submitted successfully once per 30 days. This amount of attempts to revoke criteria is only applies to this process and does NOT effect the Grant Support Squad or Revocation Committee process. The revocation proposal CANNOT be submitted by it's own grantee or team member of the grant. If the proposal does not meet Quorem, it does not count as a successful submission to revoke and therefore can be submitted again.\n\n### Passed Revocations\n\nIf the Grant Revocation is successfully passed, it would immediately pause the vesting contract. The Grantee would be deemed ineligible for re-applying for a similar grant in the future. The grantee can apply for a new grant that is different in nature in the future as it does NOT forbid all grants from that grantee.\n\n### Denied Revocations\n\nIf the Grant Revocation proposal successfully meets quorem, but fails to pass the proposal. The grant would continue as usual. No Grant Revocation proposal for that specific grant can be made for another 30 days. The grantee, however cannot use this process as an excuse for shortfalls on their project updates.\n\n### Funds given to Grantee\n\nFunds that are already given out to the grantee, cannot be recovered by the DAO. However, the DAO can require payments to be distributed to non-grant participants.\n\nFor example, if the grant says they plan to reward a prize of $1000 to the winner of a tournament which is specified in the original grant. The grantee must use any funds recieved to pay for the winner of that tournament. *All funds that are not for the grantee and are for users of Decentraland get first priority of payment.*\n\nIf the grantee fails to pay the non-grantee participants after being revoked, they shall be banned from all Discords, Forums and Decentraland related events where possible. If the grantee pays the non-grantee participants, then their bans will be lifted and they will be allowed to return. In the unusual circumstance where the DAO pays the funds to the non-grantee participants of the grant on behalf of the grant, the grantee of that grant must instead pay the DAO back in order for bans to be lifted.\n\n### Additional Clarifications\n\nThis does NOT remove power from the Grant Support Squad or Revocations Committee. This simply gives an alternate option or process for the DAO to revoke grants in a decentralized form.\n\n### Enactment\n\nIf passed, this would create a new process and new voting category for the DAO to be able to revoke grants in a decentralized manner.\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Amend DAO Governance Proposal Stages",
    "body": "> by 0xd4f1cab694c4424c4796549edbb9b489789f4df5 (TudaMoon)\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe enacted governance that is to be amended is to be found here: [DAO Governance Proposal Stages](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=5193f850-5c00-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174). This proposal would amend the original policy of the passed governance to reflect the following changes. Any conflicts from this proposal and the original enacted governance (referred to above) will be superseded by this proposal.\n\n### Problem\n\nThe original proposal is ideal, however the process takes forever. If Decentraland wants to make changes to policy, it takes a minimum of 26 days to get something enacted. That 26 days only can happen if the next stage of the proposal is immediately submitted directly after the passing of the previous stage. This makes it timely and difficult to pass needed policies or amend policies.\n\nAfterall, most of the time, you hear from people \"The first proposal should pass easily, it's just to move to the next stage.\" All in all that is true, which essentially makes the first stage pointless.\n\n### State of Decentraland\n\nCurrently Decentraland is not very active and seems like it has drastically slowed down. It is important that new policies are made to protect the brand and redirect Decentraland to a more successful path. However, this can take months. Months are almost like years in web3. Web3 moves fast and those who do not keep up, get left behind. We need to decrease the duration of the total time for these governance proposals to stay competitive.\n\n### Solution\n\n### Stage 1: Initial Pitch\n\n**Purpose:** Present the basic concept of the proposal to gauge preliminary community interest.\nContent: Include a concise summary of the proposal’s intent, potential impact, and a brief outline of implementation steps.\n**Voting Period:** 72 hours (3 days).\n**Quorem:** 1 Million VP\n**Submission Threshold:** 1,000 VP\n\n### Stage 2: Detailed Policy Proposal\n\nPurpose: Provide a comprehensive and formally written governance proposal after incorporating feedback from Stage 1. This will be the enacted policy if passed, as it is written in this stage.\n**Voting Period:** 168 hours (7 days).\n**Quorem:** 4 Million VP\n**Submission Threshold:** 1,000 VP\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis amended process should help Decentraland move more swiftly with policy creation and amendments. This also gives the ability to remove bad or poor policy. This amends the original enacted policy (link above). This policy will remove Stage 3 from the governance proposal process. From this point forward, all governance will be passed in 2 stages according to the policy criteria above.\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Player Compensation for Duel Arena",
    "body": "> by 0xd4f1cab694c4424c4796549edbb9b489789f4df5 (TudaMoon)\n\nShould the following $1,400 grant in the Core Unit category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Duel Arena game, a grant-funded game within Decentraland, recently concluded a tournament with promised payouts. Unfortunately, the grant originally allocated for these payouts was revoked, and Injester chose to withhold the funds rather than distribute them to the tournament winners. This has resulted in significant disappointment and distrust among the players, who invested time and effort with the expectation of a fair reward.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n1,400 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n1 month\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xd4f1cAb694c4424C4796549edbb9B489789F4Df5\n\n## Email address\n\nTudamoon@proton.me\n\n## Description\n\nWhile these players not being paid out is no fault of Decentraland, this is an opportunity for Decentraland to do the right thing and make sure that these players got paid. The players who are owed money by Injester had nothing to do with the grant's revocation. Those players were simply supporters of the Duel Arena game. To resolve this issue and restore trust within the community, Decentraland DAO proposes to allocate funds directly to the affected players. This will not only compensate them for their efforts but also reinforce Decentraland's commitment to fair play and integrity.\n\nThis grant will not be a recurring thing if game projects fail or get revoked. Therefore, it should NOT hold as a precedent. This is going to be taken as a lesson learned for everyone that in the future, the responsibility will forever be on the project and the player’s own willingness to take risk.\n\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThis is completely for repayment of the players who participated in Duel Arena's Tournaments and failed to get paid. I hope the funds can be allocated directly to the following wallets with the correct amounts:\n\npaulyong =$175\n0x6aa991C9a995091Cb2d082734B684201ab7163C3\n\nGamer =$1000\n0xe5104e449950180C459447F2971C8A760456B635\n\nKrek5521 =$100\n0x0DA24951ff95603FA424850c732C91CB1159cd44\n\nMiladlasso =$125\n0xA8c9cb3A05b78FE275Fa098DF4C95593acEE62e0\n\nIf these cannot be sent directly from the DAO. I, Tudamoon, pledge to make sure that the correct amount (minus gas fees) is transferred to each wallet.\n\n\n## Milestones\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (LordLike)\n\n**PROBLEM**\n\nThe current curation process in Decentraland lacks balance in the distribution of collections among curators. This imbalance leads to a situation where some curators can earn significantly more while others get little to no work due to not being as fast or not using parsers or bots to get notifications about new collections.\n\nThis demotivates some curators as they are left without work opportunities, leading to an unfair distribution of tasks and rewards.\n\n**POTENTIAL SOLUTION**\n\nTo address this issue, we propose the implementation of an automated curation system that ensures a fair distribution of collections among curators. The key features of this system would include:\n\n*   Automated Assignment: A bot that automatically assigns new collections to curators who have curated fewer items that month. This ensures that work is evenly distributed.\n\n*   Time-Based Reassignment: If a curator does not respond to a collection assignment within a specified time period, the collection is reassigned to the next available curator.\n\n*   Review Limitation: Once a curator has approved a collection with n wearables, they will not be able to review additional wearables until all other curators have had the opportunity to review n wearables each. This prevents any single curator from monopolizing the curation process.\n\n*   Sequential Curation Restriction: Curators should not be able to review more than one collection in a row. This further ensures a balanced distribution of work.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nImplementing an automated curation system with these features will promote fairness, motivate curators, and enhance the overall efficiency of the curation process in Decentraland. By ensuring that collections are evenly distributed, all curators will have equal opportunities to contribute and earn, fostering a more balanced and motivated curation process.\n\n**VOTING OPTIONS**\n\nYES: Restructure Curation Process.\n\nNO: Leave as it is.\n\nThis is a non-binding pre-proposal poll to assess community sentiment.

The current moderation needs re-evaluation to ensure it effectively manages community interactions and enforces guidelines. This initiative addresses the need for effective moderation to keep up with the evolving community.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nWe propose a community-driven approach to select new moderators for the Discord, Forum, Gov Platform, and DAO Headquarters to manage the Code of Ethics application within the whole DAO ecosystem. This involves a Bidding and Tendering process where members nominate and vote for moderators. The selected moderators will be onboarded, ensuring they are equipped with the necessary permissions and tools to fulfill their duties.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nDecentraland and DAO Community\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nOpening the moderation role to the community allows for new perspectives and ensures a free-speech environment within voted guidelines. This fresh approach prevents stalling and encourages new initiatives.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Lands for Rent Heatmap: Similar to the sale layer, but showing rental prices across the map with a color gradient. Both heatmap layers include a legend on the left with the pricing scale and corresponding colors. When a heatmap is active the background map is now grayscale to allow the color-coded land prices to stand out more vividly.\nTo access the new heatmap layers:\nLands for Sale Heatmap > https://genesis.city/#0,0,2z,n0,e0,c0,p0,s1,r0\n![Lands for Sale Heatmap](https://i.ibb.co/6rVW9Pf/lands-For-Sale-Heatmap.png)\n\nLands for Rent Heatmap > https://genesis.city/#0,0,2z,n0,e0,c0,p0,s0,r1\n![Lands for Rent Heatmap](https://i.ibb.co/GnDrFCC/lands-For-Rent-Heatmap.png)\n\n**Games Layer:**\nWe've added a new Games Layer to Genesis City, making it easy to locate and access all the games available in Decentraland. The Games Layer shows the position of every game on the Genesis City map. Left click on a game's location and you'll jump straight into it.\nTo view the Games Layer:\nGames Layer > https://genesis.city/#0,0,2z,n0,e0,c0,p0,s0,r0,g1\n![Games Layer](https://i.ibb.co/kcS5516/games-Layer.png)\n\n**Art Layer:**\nAllowing you to easily discover and explore all the art venues and galleries within Decentraland. With the Art Layer toggle on, you can see the precise locations of every art spot on the Genesis City map. Simply navigate to an art venue's location, and you'll have the option to jump right in.\nTo view the Art Layer:\nArt Layer > https://genesis.city/#0,0,3z,n0,e0,c0,p0,s0,r0,g0,a1\n![Art Layer](https://i.ibb.co/FgDY4jB/artLayer.png)\n\n**UI Enhancement**\nWe've updated our layer toggle controls, categorizing them for easy navigation.\n![Layer controls](https://i.ibb.co/0mpmdCJ/layer-Controls.png)\n\nFinally, we improved our project's maintenance processes and stability. We paid off some technical debt and fixed bugs.\nWe remain committed to engaging with our community and continue to receive valuable feedback from our users, including requests for new features and improvements.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe will update the map weekly for 6 months.\nIf the proposal is approved, our main focus for the next period will be to generate historical views of Genesis City. Soon, you will be able to select past dates and view the state of Genesis City as it was on those days. This feature will allow you to explore the evolution of Genesis City over time, providing valuable insights and a fascinating look at its development.\n![DCLtimelapse](https://i.ibb.co/0Qbc9WF/600pxezgif-1-7bbaf5f2ac.gif)\n\n**Here are some of the projects in our roadmap:**\n\n*   Historical view of the entire map.\n*   Land ownership layer.\n*   Live users locations.\n*   Display weekly events.\n*   See what's nearby a location (eg. display info of events, POIs, etc).\n*   Street view.\n*   Land rating system.\n*   Isometric views.\n*   Allow users to upload photos of lands.\n*   Staff picks.\n*   Layer showing frequency of land updates.\n*   Percentage of land development (user feedback).\n*   Include missing parts of Aetheria (user feedback).\n*   Search bar.\n*   Bookmarks/favorite destinations.\n*   Content age heatmap.\n*   Display the bus routes.\n*   Monthly/weekly treasure hunt.\n*   Geolocated comments.\n*   Metamask log-in for displaying user-owned lands.\n*   Livestream of virtual cameras from certain points in DCL.\n*   Design tweaks.\n\n**We will continue improving the website and mapping script based on this list and future suggestions by our community.

    "title": "Decentraland DAO Proposal: Introducing Proposal Submission Fees",
    "body": "> by 0xed0e0cb94f60f72ec94bef848f5df4cbd365af1d (InJesterr)\n\n**Proposal Summary**\n\nWe propose the introduction of a submission fee for certain categories of proposals within the Decentraland DAO. This fee, set at $25 worth of MANA, will be directed to the DAO Treasury. The implementation of this fee will address key issues related to proposal submissions, enhance the value and seriousness of submitted ideas, and contribute to the DAO’s financial health.\n\n***\n\n*   **Enhancing Proposal Quality:** By introducing a submission fee, we aim to filter out less serious or low-quality proposals. The cost will encourage community members to submit well-thought-out and valuable proposals, as they will be investing financially in their ideas.\n\n*   **Supporting the DAO Treasury:** The fees collected will go directly to the DAO Treasury, providing additional funds for various DAO initiatives and projects, thereby strengthening the overall ecosystem.\n\n*   **Reducing Trolls and Overload:** Implementing a fee will help reduce the number of spam or frivolous proposals, making the review process more efficient and focused on genuinely impactful ideas.\n\n***\n\n**Fee Structure and Categories**\nWe propose the following structure for the submission fees:\n\n**Free Categories:**\n\n**Name Ban:** As name bans are typically related to preventing abuse or protecting the community, this category will remain free to ensure accessibility and responsiveness.\n\n**Hiring:** To facilitate the growth and development of the DAO, hiring proposals will be free, encouraging the recruitment of talent without financial barriers.\n\n**Removing Point of Interest**: Removing a point of interest should be free.\n\n**Paid Categories ($25 worth of MANA):**\n\n*   Catalyst Node\n*   Point of Interest\n*   Linked Wearable Registry\n*   Grant Request\n*   Pitch\n*   Special Case - Poll:\n\n**Initial Poll Submission:** Free. Polls & Drafts allow the community to gauge interest and gather initial feedback without financial constraints.\n\n**Polls and Final Poll Stages:** Once a poll passes the initial stage and reaches the Final stage, a $25 fee will be required to proceed. This fee ensures that only serious and well-supported proposals advance through the final stages.\n\n**Expected Outcomes**\n\n*   **Improved Proposal Quality:** With a financial stake involved, proposers are likely to submit more thoughtful and impactful ideas.\n*   **Increased Treasury Funds:** The DAO Treasury will benefit from an additional revenue stream, supporting more projects and initiatives.\n*   **Efficient Proposal Management:** The review process will become more efficient, focusing on high-quality proposals and reducing the administrative burden.\n\n**(Treasury Allocation: All collected fees will be directly transferred to the DAO Treasury.)**\n\n- Yes, I support this idea.\n- Yes, but raise the price.\n- Yes, but lower the price.\n- No, I don't support this idea.\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

I also have a great amount of experience with government and political work. I'm truly amazed at how far the organsation of the decentralized web3 has come. It's this amazement that has sparked my creativity.\n\nI'm looking for a funding and a start of a project for creating a irl anime based in the cyberpunk vibe. I've been writing and planning a webseries and I would love to make it real. The first \"animation studio\" driven by a group of people on the block-chain. Decentralized company.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nI would be the creative lead for a team of artists, animators producing a brand new anime based in the cyberpunk universe.\n\nWould have to create a team, people who want to join the project as partners, artists, animators, voice actors, musicians, writers and sound engineers. Even split in funding by the blockchain. Investors wanting to support this project as an investment opportunity are welcomed.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nPeople who seek entertainment, they want to watch an entertaining show.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nAs the world we should be evolving into, a greater user of the decentralized web3 we should be able to consume premium content created and funded by the community. Compare it as the \"Netflix\" of the web3. With premium curated content to watch, create, share and enjoy on web3\n\nSide comment\n\nThese answers are a little all over the place, I find it hard to write inside of the set boxes.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

You can start right away building Decentraland content with the Unity Editor [here](https://github.com/PolygonalMind/dcl-dev-exportersdk7-release).\n\n**Vision**\n\nWith this update to the Unity Exporter Toolkit for Decentraland we aim to establish a pipeline that allows creators to future-proof their creations no matter if they built directly with a cmd-SDK pipeline or they used the Decentraland Builder.\n\n**The problem we found, explained**\n\nThere is a general issue when it comes to maintaining or developing projects in Decentraland, either you are an artist and the builder lacks advanced tools to add gamification and custom code or you are a developer and the compiled SDK7 project lacks a visual editor to quickly check and upgrade the scene.\n\nThe current state of the exporter allows anyone to build Decentraland scenes directly in the Unity editor and export them as SDK7 projects ready to deploy but doesn’t work the other way around.\n\n![OldFramework](https://white-legal-elk-728.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcTaXjyrLKDuwZzW3ZQy1e6Se6VhRrVJ85SxtgfkBvZJ8/OldFramework.png)\n\nFurthermore solutions like the Decentraland builder or the IWB force a creator to be connected constantly to the network, with no possibility to work offline or keep the work backed in a repository or version controlled at all.\n\n**Solution**\n\nCreate a bridge that allows any SDK6 and SDK7 to be compatible with the Unity Editor Toolkit, enhancing development and content creation and establishing a robust way to preserve and update previous and future Decentraland content.\n\n![NewFramework](https://white-legal-elk-728.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcTaXjyrLKDuwZzW3ZQy1e6Se6VhRrVJ85SxtgfkBvZJ8/NewFramework.png)\n\nThrough the editor:\n\n*   You can import already made Decentraland scenes into Unity and deploy them back with enhancements.\n*   Upgrade SDK6 projects to the SDK7 and preserve base components to keep building under the new framework.\n*   Combine the power of a detailed and industry standard editor to take your creations to the next level.\n\nIn the abstract you can find a rough demo we have made as a proof of concept of what we want to achieve and grant to all creators. With a default scene from the Builder, we imported it back into the Unity Toolkit, where we would, as creators, keep building and expanding with more models, components and scene behaviours.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Goals**\n\n*   Ensure there is a way to preserve content from Decentraland SDK6 and SDK7 scenes and preserve them in a more industry-compatible way.\n*   Revive stuck or zombie projects. Make use of a friendly pipeline by migrating it into the editor.\n*   Give a way to already made scenes to expand in complexity and get all the benefits the Unity Editor Toolkit for Decentraland has.\n*   Keep lowering the barriers of access to create content in the platform thanks to the great file format flexibility Unity has.\n*   Make SDK7 development flexible and SDK6 migrations easier. We will be adding a painless process of deployment that will be run in Unity, the same way you can preview your work you will be able to roll it out in any scene you operate or world you own.\n\nThe tool will have now two options to import any SDK7 or SDK6 .zip files, allowing creators to keep building detailed scenes directly in the Unity editor and export them back as ready-to-deploy.\n\nFurthermore\n\n*   The tool will be properly updated to contain any component update from the SDK7 and clean up the road (and code) for any future update of content and editor possibilities.\n\nWe feel confident on delivering all the defined features in 3 months, divided in regular milestones as it follows:\n\n*   *Milestone 1*\n    *   SDK7 Project Import\n*   *Milestone 2*\n    *   SDK7 Components Import\n    *   SDK6 Project Import\n*   *Milestone 3*\n    *   SDK6 Components Import\n    *   QA and Debug\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

It is designed to ensure that each POI maximizes engagement, maintains relevance, and reflects the unique values of our virtual world.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe effective management and categorization of Points of Interest (POIs) in Decentraland are vital to enhancing the platform's navigability and overall user experience. This proposal addresses the community’s call for a more organized and meaningful interaction with these virtual landmarks, ensuring they serve as true beacons of engagement and culture.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**1. Categories:**\n\n*   Venue POIs: Places that regularly host events, such as clubs and event spaces.\n\n*   Art POIs: Permanent installations valued for their artistic merit, independent of events.\n\n*   Commercial POIs: Locations representing commercial entities (e.g., brand stores) that maintain a presence in Decentraland.\n\n*   Legacy POIs: Landmarks that showcase the history and evolution of Decentraland.\n\n*   Education POIs: Spaces focused on educational activities and resources, such as virtual classrooms, universities, libraries, or museums.\n\n*   Gaming POIs: Dedicated areas where users can engage in interactive and immersive gaming experiences.\n\n*   Memorial POIs: Places dedicated to honoring individuals who have passed.\n\n*   Dynamic POIs: Seasonal or event-driven points that adapt based on community engagement and popularity.\n\n*   Financial Sector and Banking POIs: These POIs should provide services related to finance, banking, investment, or cryptocurrency within Decentraland.\n\n*   Other POIs: A flexible category for any POIs that do not fit into the above categories, ensuring inclusivity in our classification system.\n\n**2. General Criteria(non-binding recommendations):**\n\n*   Author having a minted Decentraland Name.\n\n*   Offering something distinctively unique to the community.\n\n*   Adherence to technical and aesthetic standards.\n\n**3. Category Eligibility Criteria:**\n\nPOIs must be established according to the categorization criteria. Each POI should clearly align with one category to be considered for inclusion.\n\n*   Venue POIs: Must have a history of organizing and hosting community-driven events.\n\n*   Art POIs: Should be recognized for contributions to arts. Must update their exhibits at least once a year to maintain relevance and engagement.\n\n*   Commercial POIs: Need a commitment to maintaining a presence in Decentraland, with periodic reassessment. Applicants should be given a 1-year period, after which they must reapply.\n\n*   Legacy POIs: Should represent historical significance.\n\n*   Education POIs: Organizers must demonstrate connections to educational initiatives or institutions.\n\n*   Gaming POIs: Should be a track record in creating games. Must incorporate new features or updates at least once a year to stay aligned with SDK and tech advancements.\n\n*   Memorial POIs: Must adhere to principles of respect and historical integrity.\n\n*   Dynamic POIs: Require a flexible and responsive design to remain relevant based on user interaction.\n\n*   Financial Sector and Banking POIs: Must provide financial services within Decentraland or represent a globally recognized financial or crypto brand, maintaining relevance through periodic updates.\n\n*   Other POIs: Must provide a clear rationale for how they differ from other categories and their unique contribution to the community.\n\n**4. Review Mechanisms:**\n\n*   Crowdsourced Feedback: Community reports will help monitor POI quality and relevance, enhancing community involvement and oversight.\n\n*   Automated System: An automated review based on activity metrics will continuously evaluate POIs, flagging those with low engagement for further review to ensure they remain active and relevant.\n\n**5. Gov Dapp and Documentation:**\n\n*   Necessary updates will be made to the Decentraland DAO governance Dapp to reflect the updated POI process.\n\n*   Governance documentation will be revised to reflect new changes.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal sets the framework for a diverse and organized Points of Interest system in Decentraland, ensuring each POI adds distinct value and remains relevant over time. By incorporating categorization and guidelines, Decentraland will have a more interactive virtual environment.\n\nThis is a non-binding Draft proposal. If approved, feedback and insights will be solicited to refine and finalize the points for the final governance stage.\n\nIf the DAO approves this proposal in last governance stage, including the review mechanisms, a Canny request will be submitted, or a bidding and tendering process will be initiated for the technical implementation of these review mechanisms and additional client-side upgrades.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

But we are seeing in this experiment that DAOs don't intrinsically guarantee good decision making or high quality consultation, any more than the legacy forms of governance do.  I submit that the way to get there is cultural -- a growing community commitment to a style of consultation that helps us understand the real pros and cons of issues and builds greater unity around decision-making.\n\n- Yes, let's work on better communications\n- No, we're ok as it is\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This team will develop transparent and fair guidelines for addressing CoE violations. We will maintain a public log of all actions related to the CoE and deliver monthly updates to keep the community informed. Additionally, we will proactively manage channels to effectively deter spam and scams. We will also conduct regular reviews of the CoE, incorporating community feedback to facilitate necessary enhancements. Our ultimate objective is to cultivate a supportive and ethical environment for all Decentraland DAO participants. The team includes three members: two full-time members working 10 hours each and one part-time member working 4 hours, ensuring a \"follow the sun\" model with approximately 24-hour coverage.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur journey begins with a dedicated team of moderators committed to promoting a positive community environment within the Decentraland DAO. We are a team chosen for our expertise in community management and moderation. Our goal is to develop clear guidelines and procedures that uphold the Code of Ethics, ensuring they deeply resonate with what is most important to our community. Once established, these guidelines will be implemented across all platforms, clarifying everyone's roles and our approach to enforcing these rules transparently and equitably. We will maintain open communication with monthly updates on our progress, including major achievements and areas for improvement. Our commitment extends beyond just enforcing rules; we are eager to hear your feedback, learn from our experiences, and continually adapt to better meet the needs of our community. Expect regular updates, open discussions, and numerous opportunities for you to voice your opinions. Together, we'll ensure Decentraland remains a welcoming and respectful space for all participants.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

By encrypting vote choices during the voting period, it aims to eliminate undue influence and manipulation.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe current voting system in Decentraland DAO publicly displays voters' choices, which can sway decisions and reduce participation due to external pressures, biases, and potential manipulations. This proposal advocates for implementing shielded voting, which maintains confidentiality of votes until the voting period concludes.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDecentraland DAO currently operates a transparent voting system where all votes are visible throughout the voting period. This transparency can lead to unwanted voting behaviors and biases, where voters might be swayed by the visible choices of others, particularly influential community members.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n*   All voter choices for Decentraland DAO proposals will remain encrypted throughout the voting period. The preliminary results of voting options will not be visible or accessible until the voting period concludes. This encryption safeguards the confidentiality of individual preferences and the overall voting outcomes until the proposal ends.\n\n*   Shielded voting will be activated within the Decentraland DAO’s main Snapshot space. This will ensure that all future proposals utilize this voting method.\n\n*   Necessary updates will be made to the Decentraland DAO governance Dapp to support shielded voting functionality. This includes UI adjustments to reflect the encrypted voting process and to provide a user-friendly experience for voters.\n\n*   Governance documentation will be revised to include details on the new shielded voting.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nImplementing shielded voting will potentially increase voter turnout and ensure that decisions are made based on unbiased, individual judgments. By encrypting both the voter choices and the current voting results, this system stops any unfair influence during voting, making the process more honest and truly reflecting what voters want.\n\nThis is a non-binding Draft proposal. If approved, feedback and insights will be solicited to refine and finalize the points, including the need for a test period and other considerations, for the final governance stage.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (LordLike)\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nThis proposal suggests giving the Revocations Committee the authority to initiate investigations into grants without waiting for input from the Grant Support Squad. This change aims to enhance responsiveness and grants accountability, addressing community concerns more proactively.\n\n**MOTIVATION**\n\nCurrently, the Revocations Committee can only begin investigating a grant upon receiving arguments from the GSS. This limitation has resulted in delays in addressing grants involving bad actors or those failing to deliver on their promises. By allowing the Revocations Committee to initiate investigations independently, the DAO can take quicker action against misuse of funds or poor execution, ultimately protecting the DAO and community's interests and resources.\n\n**POSSIBLE SOLUTION**\n\nAllow the Revocations Committee to start grant investigations based on community alerts or their own observations, without needing preliminary findings from the GSS. This would involve revising the relevant articles in the [Revocations Committee Framework](https://dcl-dao.notion.site/1-Revocations-Committee-Framework-2f5169fa11564574a090209be927b97d) (Art. 9 Procedure) to give these new powers.\n\nPotential oversight mechanisms and specific criteria for initiating investigations will be refined based on community feedback in subsequent stages of the governance process.\n\n**VOTING OPTIONS**\n\nYES: Empower the Revocations Committee.\n\nNO: Leave  as it is.\n\nThis is a non-binding pre-proposal poll to assess community sentiment.

    "title": "Linked Wearables Redesign",
    "body": "> by 0x87956abc4078a0cc3b89b419928b857b8af826ed (Nacho)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Linked Wearables Redesign](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4e4d6bd6-78db-4e99-a517-16e43ad936da)\n\n## Summary\n\nProposed is an enhanced architecture and design for LinkedWearables to address client performance issues caused by low-performing API Resolvers and a simplification process for new third parties, from inception to maintenance of collections\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nAfter initially considering shutting down Linked Wearables due to performance drawbacks, it has become evident that the functionality is highly valued by the community and has a significant potential for expansion and adoption. However, the current model also presents bureaucratic challenges and can be cumbersome for content creators.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nTo foster greater adoption and streamline the cost and maintenance of LinkedWearables, it is necessary to implement a new process and architecture capable of adapting to the demand while preventing any potential performance issues for the client. This new model can also help improve the user experience when managing LinkedWearables in-world.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe propose the following changes to the current Linked Wearables implementation:\n\n*   Remove the ThirdParties API dependency:\n    *   Enhance the URN already used for third-party wearables to provide enough information about the NFT item with a Linked Wearable associated.\n    *   Validate NFT Ownerships on-chain using a RPC Provider and the corresponding Smart Contracts.\n    *   Creating a new UI on top of the builder to manage Linked Wearable Collections\n    *   Fetching all Linked Wearables for the backpack using a new service that will feed from the builder.\n*   Allow third parties to “Pay” directly to the DAO rather than going through a 4M MANA threshold voting process.\n*   Create a migration plan for existing thirdparties.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/8bR48f1/Screenshot-2024-04-19-at-17-28-52.png)\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nReduced entry costs and complexity for Third-Party Providers:\n\n*   Eliminated Resolver API: Third-party providers no longer need to invest in developing, deploying, and maintaining a resolver API to validate LinkedWearables ownership.\n\nNew Cost Structure:\n\n*   DAO-Covered RPC Calls: The DAO will cover the cost of new RPC calls used to retrieve user-owned NFTs and validate asset ownership in scenarios like profile deployment, node synchronization, and profile sanitization. The cost of the NFT API will be waived from the Foundation to the DAO. For pricing examples, you can refer to the available pricing plans at  https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/pricing-plans - the API calls and costs will be capped to avoid unexpected expending.\n\nThis new cost will be covered by a new third-party registration process, but it is beyond the scope of this poll. They will be addressed in a subsequent poll to discuss and determine fees and the permissible quantity of allowed published wearables.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n**Standardized URN:**  Implement a new URN format that incorporates all necessary segments for performing on-chain ownership validations of the associated NFTs.\n\n    urn:decentraland:matic:collections-thirdparty:[3rd-party-NAME]:\n    [contractAddressChain]:[contractAddress]:[itemId]:[NFTTokenId]\n\n*   **`3rd-party-NAME`**: Name of the Third Party\n*   **`contractAddressChain`:** The Chain of the NFT’s smart contracts (Polygon, Ethereum).\n*   **`contractAddress`:** The address of an ERC-721 or ERC-1155 smart contract for the NFT collection that will have associated Decentraland Item.\n*   **`itemId`:** the id of the Decentraland wearable.\n*   **`NFTTokenId`:** the 3rd party NFT tokenId that will have the associated wearable.\n\n**LinkedWearables Service**: Create a service specifically designed to manage LinkedWearables and its third-party providers. This service will:\n\n*   Store Third-Party Information: Securely store data from third-party providers, including smart contract addresses for their collections, chain IDs used, and NFT IDs corresponding to specific Decentraland wearables.\n*   **Retrieve User-Owned LinkedWearables**: Upon receiving a user's wallet address, the service will efficiently return URNs for all LinkedWearables owned by that user. This process involves retrieving the owned NFTs associated with the wallet and cross-referencing them with Decentraland wearables stored in the local database with the information set by the third party.\n\nDecentra**land UI:  Third-Party Provider Management**\n\n*   **Registration and Management Portal:** Implement a dedicated user interface for third-party providers. This interface will allow providers to:\n    *   Register as a Provider: Complete a streamlined registration process.\n    *   Collection Management: Manage their collections of LinkedWearables and the mappings between the NFTs and the Decentraland Wearables.\n*   **Data Storage**: Information entered by providers during registration and management will be securely stored within the LinkedWearables service.\n\n**Catalyst Ownership Validation and Backpack Management:**\n\n*   **LinkedWearables URN use**: Leveraging the extended URN format enables Catalyst to perform ownership validation of NFTs associated with the LinkedWearbles. The URNs provide all necessary information for Catalyst to directly call the relevant smart contracts using RPC calls.\n*   **Backpack Endpoint**: Introduce a new \"backpack endpoint\" within Catalyst. Clients can use this endpoint to request all LinkedWearables associated with a specific wallet address. This streamlines backpack management by eliminating the need to filter items provider-by-provider, as is currently required.\n\n**Smart Contract Updates**\n\n*   The existing version of the smart contracts responsible for managing third-party information must undergo an upgrade to enable the registration of new third parties.\n\n**Use Case**: Update Collection from the Builder\n![image](https://github.com/decentraland/marketplace/assets/7549152/eea8b555-c327-452d-99fa-9dafd0feb914)\n\nUse Case: Retrieve All Linked Wearables for Display in the Backpack\n![image](https://github.com/decentraland/marketplace/assets/7549152/473395de-926a-4fd3-bd7a-67e298c7a96c)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRemoving third-party APIs and implementing changes to the URN will ensure all NFT item ownership validation occurs on-chain, enhancing reliability. This model simplifies the onboarding process for new third parties by eliminating API development and maintenance costs. On the other hand, it establishes a mechanism to boost adoption among third parties and facilitates more efficient wearables management within the client interface.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x0c678c84cc5744f2a5b368ce2aeab3905624ff99 (BitcoinETF)\n\nI believe the delegated VP's are being utilized inappropriately and for personal gains in many cases.\n\nDelegated Vp's are causing harm to platform & treasury, resulting in ineffective decision making for bogus (fake - money grab) grants/projects to pass.\n\nThis ill mannered activity directly effects the DAO's treasury & platform itselft. Altough the DAO's treasury is on a fixed term budget spend per year, this doesn't mean we should be handing out FREE MONEY and receive nothing in return.\n\nRevoking the VP delegation is by no means a complete solution but it is a great start. I've mentioned about this in my previous comments. However the feedback I, received from Esteban's delegated VP fam was an extremely unpleasant experience. Because for this group, taking away their 500,000 VP would mean they end up with almost nothing, some with even less than 100 VP. Which is basically nothing. Compared to 500,000 VP.\n\nI am not saying they shouldn't have a voice but their voice should be reflected proportionally based upon the platform assets they own. Mana, Land, Select L1 skins etc.. In other words, if you want to have a stronger position in DAO why not show that by the platform assets you own? Show your support and become a Contributor or a Stakeholder so you can have more impact in decision making with your own money rather than someone else's.\n\nThis might now be an easy thing to swallow & can be very upsetting for many. Becuase going from 500,000 VP to 100 VP or less is a devastating outcome. In the grand sceheme of things I truly believe this is a must & it's a good start.\n\nI am in the opinion for all Delegated VP's to be revoved not just the Esteban's Delegated VP's. Land VP & Mana VP included.\n\nThis brings the question for those who travel frequently or those who don't want to interact with their main accounts on the regualar basis. For this group I suggest a simple solution. Verified Linked Accounts. User has to verify they will be using an alternative adress or wallet & limit only one Verified Linked Account per user. We may also implement time based Verified Linked Accounts\n\nI believe this is a great starting point\n\nPlease share your thoughts & opinions\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The objective is to ensure more reflective and fair governance decisions.\n\n**POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS**\n\n*1. Randomized Proposal Voting End Time*\n\nImplement a randomized closure period toward the end of the established proposal’s voting timeframe. The exact closing moment of the DAO proposal will not be known to voters but will occur randomly within a predetermined percentage of the closing phase of the proposal voting period. This specific percentage and the parameters for randomness will be determined based on community feedback.\n\n*2. Extension of the Voting Period*\n\nExtend the standard proposal voting period if significant voting activity occurs in the final hours or minutes. This extension will be triggered if the vote margin changes by more than a predefined percentage (to be determined through community input) within the last 24 hours. This allows stakeholders more time to evaluate and react to late swings in voting outcomes.\n\n**VOTING OPTIONS**\n\nYES: Change Governance Mechanism.\n\nNO: Leave as it is.\n\nThis is a non-binding pre-proposal poll to assess community sentiment. If approved, feedback and insights will be solicited to refine and finalize the points.\n\n- YES\n- NO\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This last-minute influx of VP can skew outcomes and undermine the democratic ideals of the DAO.\n\nGradually reducing VP over the course of the voting period, could help to incentivize early participation and will also bring more predictability, allowing community members to anticipate voting dynamics and participate accordingly, as well as discouraging strategic manipulation of the voting process.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Ultimately, the decision was made to maintain open data, leading to the emergence of new wallet analytics apps in Decentraland. However, the fact that anyone could get a detailed analytic dashboard with users names and activity for any wallet raised concerns about data privacy breaches, causing discomfort and preoccupation about privacy safeguards.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nA misalignment exists between Decentraland's data privacy policy, which has raised user concerns, and the potential conflict regarding the disclosure of user behavior.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nCatalyst's communication server exposes API endpoints that broadcast user wallets and real-time locations, enabling anyone to:\n\n*   **Track user movement**: This data can be used to create user behavior analytics, potentially revealing specific user habits and routines.\n*   **Facilitate harassment**: Malicious actors could exploit this information to harass other users on the platform.\n*   **Lack of opt-out**: Currently, there's no way for a platform user to prevent their wallet address and location from being displayed in the API results.\n\nProposed Solution: Balancing Transparency and Privacy with Anonymouse Session IDs and Metrics\n\nWhile recognizing the value of public platform metrics and analytics, an alternative approach can address privacy concerns. Instead of removing the endpoint entirely, wallets could be replaced by anonymous session IDs. Here's how it would work:\n\n1.  **Session ID Generation**: Whenever a user connects to Decentraland, a unique and anonymous session ID is generated.\n2.  **Replacing Wallets**: This session ID would replace the user's wallet address in all API responses.\n3.  **Unlinkable Sessions-Wallet**: Since new session IDs are generated for each connection, linking them back to specific user wallets would not be possible.\n\nThis API change will come along a new endpoint to help scenes validate users' positions, the operation will be as follows:\n\n*   **Input**: This API would accept a user's sessionId or wallet and a specific range of parcels within the scene.\n*   **Output**: The API would respond with a simple \"true\" or \"false\":\n\nTrue: indicates the user is present within one of the specified parcels.\nFalse: indicates the user is not present in any of the queried parcels.\n\nThis approach offers a balanced solution. Public platform metrics can still be obtained for analytics purposes and scenes will still be able to validate user’s positions while privacy is protected by anonymizing user data through session IDs.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed solution balances transparency and privacy by replacing wallets with anonymous session IDs. This approach maintains the value of public platform metrics and analytics while safeguarding user privacy.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

By linking VP to approved submissions, this initiative strives to encourage ongoing contributions and acknowledge the creators’ role in the Decentraland development.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nContent creators are integral to the vitality of Decentraland, crafting the items that define user experiences. Currently  these creators lack representation in governance. This proposal seeks to change the situation by assigning VP to creators, ensuring their efforts are recognized and rewarded.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe VP would be awarded as follows:\n\n*   Content creators must pay a submission fee of [100 USD paid in MANA](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/wearables/publishing-collections/) for each creation item submitted to the marketplace.\n\n*   Once a collection is approved, the submitting wallet will be credited with an amount of VP equivalent to the MANA cost paid during submission.\n\n*   The VP amount will be determined by the MANA's price at the time of submission or approval.\n\n*   The VP will be calculated at a rate of 1 MANA = 1 VP.\n\n*   Should a collection be rejected, the awarded VP will be deducted from the creator’s total VP count.\n\n### Policy Implementation\n\nThis policy will only apply to new submissions made after the implementation date of this proposal if approved in the next governance stage. All past submissions will not be eligible for VP based on their previous submission fees.\n\n### Snapshot Strategy Development\n\nTo accurately reflect the allocation of VP for content creators, a specific snapshot strategy will be developed and integrated into the Decentraland governance system.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal aims to ensure that creators are vested stakeholders in the governance of Decentraland. This change is expected to foster a more diverse, and engaging metaverse, directly benefiting the entire community.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Utilizing our proprietary Video Select System (VSS), users will have the freedom to choose which videos they watch, fostering a personalized and community-driven experience. This initiative will facilitate knowledge-sharing, community building, and onboarding of new users to the DCL ecosystem.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n30,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4475F233A7A5532EDDDcD95d9b1df048ec0e8889\n\n## Email address\n\njstickel@metaonedesigns.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe Decentraland platform thrives on community engagement and knowledge-sharing, yet lacks a centralized hub for educational content specific to DCL. Our project addresses this gap by establishing a Community Video Library, where users can access curated video series covering various aspects of DCL, from tutorials and showcases to discussions and interviews.\n\nOur innovative VSS ensures that each user has a personalized viewing experience. Regardless of the number of users on the land, individuals can select their preferred video to watch, without interference from others. This decentralized approach aligns with the core principles of DCL, empowering users to explore content tailored to their interests and learning needs.\n\nBy hosting video series from diverse content creators within the DCL community, we foster inclusivity and collaboration. Content creators will have the opportunity to showcase their expertise and contribute to the collective knowledge base of DCL. We have a series up right now at our land (106,50) you can look at, it is called Learning Decentraland by SinfulMedia https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/playback/937997834/rendition/1080p/file.mp4?loc=external\\&log_user=0\\&signature=021c521a77c46fc1348a1cb7fa7a0bd82df0ab62a4fc16337592910702d58a5d.\nAdditionally, new users visiting the platform can easily access educational resources, accelerating their learning curve and integration into the community.\nWhen more people participate in The Community Video Library, it will be organized across multiple floors, each dedicated to a different video series. This structure enables users to explore various topics and engage with content that resonates with their interests. Through this initiative, we envision a vibrant and interconnected community where members come together to learn, share, and collaborate within the immersive environment of Decentraland.\n\nWith your support, we aim to enrich the DCL platform, empower its community members, and attract new users by providing a valuable resource for education and engagement.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nRoadmap and milestones\nDevelopment of the Video Select System (VSS) and infrastructure setup (Already completed).\n\nOutreach to content creators and community members for video submissions (Month 1-3+).\n\nDesign and construction of the Community Video Library within Decentraland (Already completed).\n\nLaunch of the initial video series and user testing (Already up and running).\n\nImprovements based on user feedback and community engagement (Month 3+).\n\nOngoing maintenance, curation, and expansion of the video library (Continuous).\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

However, the current model also presents bureaucratic challenges and can be cumbersome for content creators.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nTo foster greater adoption and streamline the cost and maintenance of LinkedWearables, it is necessary to implement a new process and architecture capable of adapting to the demand while preventing any potential performance issues for the client. This new model can also help improve the user experience when managing LinkedWearables in-world.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe propose the following changes to the current Linked Wearables implementation:\n\n*   Remove the ThirdParties API dependency:\n    *   Enhance the URN already used for third-party wearables to provide enough information about the NFT item with a Linked Wearable associated.\n    *   Validate NFT Ownerships on-chain using a RPC Provider and the corresponding Smart Contracts.\n    *   Creating a new UI on top of the builder to manage Linked Wearable Collections\n    *   Fetching all Linked Wearables for the backpack using a new service that will feed from the builder.\n*   Allow third parties to “Pay” directly to the DAO rather than going through a 4M MANA threshold voting process.\n*   Create a migration plan for existing thirdparties.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/8bR48f1/Screenshot-2024-04-19-at-17-28-52.png)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRemoving third-party APIs and implementing changes to the URN will ensure all NFT item ownership validation occurs on-chain, enhancing reliability. This model simplifies the onboarding process for new third parties by eliminating API development and maintenance costs. On the other hand, it establishes a mechanism to boost adoption among third parties and facilitates more efficient wearables management within the client interface.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x4e5a351839117021610315c6182467365c6768d7 (aleescoda)\n\nShould the following $13,680 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe are looking for a renewal of our grant to keep [Decentraland Studios](https://studios.decentraland.org/) operational.\n\nDecentraland Studios, the platform that connects experienced creators with brands in Decentraland, has successfully facilitated deals for numerous studios and has become the go-to platform for the Decentraland Foundation to create job opportunities and hire creators. We have been working on maintenance mode since November 2023, ensuring its operations with minimal resources.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n13,680 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x256874B9FD26cBf11a4E2DE5CFFE5a877603044d\n\n## Email address\n\nstudios@decentraland.org\n\n## Description\n\nDecentraland Studios has come a long way from its creation. Our journey began with the mission to create a public registry of individuals and organizations offering their services to build content on Decentraland's platform. The aim was to provide transparency to brands looking for talented builders for event productions, wearables, 3D modeling, and SDK programming. This initiative was born out of the desire to democratize access to qualified suppliers and generate new business opportunities for creators within the Decentraland community. See our first grant proposal [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=81af5b00-02e6-11ed-8f44-ef1722f0509f).\n\nOur [second grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=81283aa0-b946-11ed-95dc-afd12ca00986) focused on creating business opportunities for our verified studios. We launched the Jobs feature streamlining job opportunities for Decentraland creators and we ran performance marketing campaigns to generate leads.\n\nThe [third grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5f962e70-22ef-11ee-8ace-3bf098daeebe) focused on enhancing the user experience by improving communication between studios and brands. To achieve this, a dashboard and a messaging system were introduced to facilitate a seamless interaction.\n\nWith the [fourth grant](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=d85bdf8e-bdfc-47cf-b6c6-6b55f7a96d93), we entered a new phase. Our focus was on platform maintenance mode using minimal resources, ensuring its operation for future market opportunities. We addressed and fixed security challenges reported through the Decentraland Foundation bounty program, details in our latest update. In this grant, we updated the studios listed on the registry, enhancing the list of creators available for potential collaborations in 2024.\n\nThis fifth grant is looking forward to continuing our maintenance mode to keep the platform running smoothly and growing steadily.\n\nOver the past 5 months:\n\n*   Unique Visitors: 6.1K\n*   Page Views: 24.7K\n*   A total of 31 job posts.\n*   10 of these job posts have generated total revenue of $52,500 for 10 different studios (shared voluntarily by some posters).\n*   713 job posts have been moderated.\n*   Onboarded Studios: 18\n*   Consultation Meetings Scheduled: 3\n\nThe historical context and achievements have brought us to this point, where we must sustain the valuable resources we have created for the Decentraland ecosystem. While we have optimized our platform to minimize costs, maintaining and operating Decentraland Studios does incur ongoing expenses.\n\nAs long as the community chooses to keep Decentraland Studios operational it will require continuous financial aid.\n\nFor this grant, we kindly request community support to ensure the sustainability and growth of Decentraland Studios. Our mission remains the same: connecting creators with brands and promoting transparency within the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMay 2024 to October 2024\n\nIn these 6 months, my role as the Day-to-Day Operations Manager will be focused on maintaining the platform's smooth operation. Our main goal is to preserve the current user base and ensure the reliability of our platform for both, creators and brands.\n\nThese are the key areas that require attention to ensure a smooth operation:\n\n*   Addressing user inquiries.\n*   Onboarding new studios.\n*   Verifying challenges from studios.\n*   Moderating job opportunities.\n*   Notifying and encouraging studios to submit proposals.\n*   Following-up posted projects.\n*   Engaging potential customers.\n*   Maintaining our presence on social media.\n*   Supporting Verified Studios.\n\nAdditionally, a direct line of communication will be maintained with the development team to address any technical issues or challenges that may arise.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": " Renewal New DAO Explorers: Mobile, VR, and Desktop (in Godot & Bevy)",
    "body": "> by 0x83f9192d59b393c8789b55d446e5d4a77075c820 (ProtocolSquad#c820)\n\nShould the following $155,560 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nOur team has made significant steps in the Explorers in the past six months, launching Android and iOS clients. Now, our main goal is to enhance the stability of the Explorers and let them to a final version. VR is working very well but the UI/UX needs to move to 3D interactions instead. Finally, the Bevy Desktop client now allows us to quickly introduce and test new features for content creators, like lights, cinematic cameras, GLTF manipulation, and so on.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n155,560 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x04812c531083054863ef354EF600A61857921466\n\n## Email address\n\ndclprotocolsquad@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/723PkKB.png)\n\n### Introduction\n\nWe are very excited to have met and achieved the objectives outlined in our latest proposal. Whether in the Godot-developed client for mobile or Bevy for desktop, it is possible to enter and explore the different worlds of Decentraland, interact with other players, customize your avatar, and discover all new places. Thanks to this solid base, today we are in very good shape to propose even more and enrich the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n### The Bevy client as a springboard for creators\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/3yu0Ckr.png)\n\nOn the one hand, we have the client made in Bevy, which, while **working very well and smoothly**, is the perfect scenario to test and iterate on new functionalities that will **enrich the content in Decentraland**.\n\nWe want to allow content creators to **add lights, set up ambient lighting**, and **access the GLTF internal content** in order to accelerate the creation pipeline based on this really solid standard. Additionally, we know some features *are long overdue* and need to be released as soon as possible, such as **cinematic camera and scrollable UI.**\n\nIterating on these new functionalities in the Bevy client first will allow us to quickly discover if there are blockers or any challenges, and **make appropriate documentation and specifications** so that both the Mobile/VR client in Godot and the Foundation Desktop in Unity can easily implement them as well.\n\n### The Mobile and VR era for Decentraland\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/n0gkf7f.png)\n\nDevelopments on the Godot client have focused on providing a *final beta product*, and this is now ready to be used. The mobile versions **are already in stores**, in a **public beta** and you *can explore* any type of scene and *interact with other players*.\n\nHaving worked in the last grant to prepare the foundations serving Mobile and VR, we can now iterate to **improve performance and optimization** to achieve a solid experience in both targets. At the same time, we want to start focusing on perfecting both products by adding ambient sounds, music, alerts and differentiating them by **adding a UX designed specifically for VR**.\n\nIn terms of optimization, we will do research to minimize annoying hiccups which, although already improved over the web client, are not tolerable for the VR version. In this sense, we will work together with Bevy if it is necessary to expose tools that allow this to be improved on the content creator's side. We'll also provide guides and development tools for content creators to test their scenes on Mobile and VR.\n\n### Old content also matter\n\nWe’re going to keep implementing the **SDK6 Adaptation Layer**, so old content is accessible from our Explorers. This is an SDK7 scene that can run the SDK6 scene converting the messages to be used by the SDK7 runtime.\n\nPublic document with this same information, just in case:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1aefap7cayJGMfEUmyHViwFRlkD4sROGfE9HALqnj1PY\n\nWatch our videos!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb8kyCvauFQ\\&list=PLBmhkGNdurqgz7OD5uDIdDVYvGkBIApCo\\&index=4\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nEach **milestone** represents two months.\n\n### Godot development\n\n*   Keep maintaining the mobile public beta until officially released\n*   **Milestone 1**: Mobile and VR\n    1.

    "title": "Should We Revoke Fraudulent IWB Gaming Grant?",
    "body": "> by 0xe945ed0530da54c1af15c6b034be9ef3e6bbe7b1 (OGContraBand)\n\nFACT - In World Buidler can't even be used by the general public except through the expired contest.  Because of this it's the very opposite of a \"platform\" tool.\n\nIns spite of this the following grant has passed https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=bf3c236b-ebcf-4e79-a3c2-26ddbfdb30eb.  While the demo looked very good, the tools should first be made accessible to all and no new user could use this.  Because of this the grant to expand IWB for gaming is fraudulent and invalid.  The in-world grants are frozen and this is litterally called \"in-world\".  This money could have been used to buy games from actual steam game developers now that the polygonal minds project may allow for direct deployment from Unity to worlds.  This budget could have been used to get actual game developers met at GDC to deploy to world. Next the team has not demonstrated any functioning games to my knowledge - correct me if I'm wrong.  If someone didn't make something fun top play after 1/2 million dollars in grants it's unlikely that they ever will.\n\nAll this painted an extremely bad picture for the anti-game-developer DAO.  The freezing of grants went down exactly like we knew it would where special insiders get a free pass to loot.  Lastly this is a 'slap in the face' to those people who actually developed games in DCL and got defunded or never got funding to begin with.\n\nIn summation this money would be much better spent and buying games already made in unity for steam and rewarding people who already made games in DCL.\n\n- Yes revoke grant\n- No keep grant\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

We will continue to provide support and monitoring for 37 current grants, including those from bidding and tendering, as well as upcoming projects.\n\nQuestions and positive comments are always welcome!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n71,200 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x658497d7681e4Fb18C65AbD5Ce066A1e3082c1e5\n\n## Email address\n\npablo.lewin@decentraland.org\n\n## Description\n\nOur daily tasks represent a continual dedication to supporting, guiding, analyzing, and ensuring accountability for grants. The Squad operates with 4 key objectives:\n\n**1) Support Grant Projects**\n\n*   Periodic Follow-up with grantees to identify problems and requests, audit the grant projects with onboardings, updating roadmaps, monthly calls and facilitating contacts.\n*   Analyze problems and requests, identify and solve them.\n*   Ensure the accessibility of information about the grants program and promote grant work through blogs on the official blog administered by the Foundation.\n\n**2) Foster Transparency and accountability**\n\n*   Write a status update monthly on grantees public roadmap, and provide spaces to share their work and gather feedback with Testing Sessions and Townhalls.\n*   Provide information about the accountability of projects by publishing concerns raised, and analyzing the cases.\n*   Maintain and update the DAO's Grants Github repo.\n\n**3) Take care of DAO Grants Treasury**\n\n*   Analyze and elevate cases to the Revocations Committee and provide support to the RC.\n*   Report on funds recovered.\n\n**4) General / DAO Participation**\n\n*   Participation in DAO ceremonials and Core Units meetings\n*   Bridge with Decentraland Foundation\n*   Maintain Documentation\n\nHere you can see [the report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JSQyFUhC0yIbXetDY2sdt_r7HZIkK6NPxYVm2YYMFyY/edit?usp=sharing) of the last 4 months of the H1 2024 Grant (our previous renewal is for 5 months and not 6, to align this renewal with the start of the Q Budget), and our [Financial Report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ue4-OIkssfASlKV8LYp6lA0MqzdWliTDJTtFuD5d0CM/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nAdditionally, after almost 2 years of the Squad's operation, we can highlight that in this last 4 month period there were no significant revocations, thanks to our diligent oversight in the DAO and the [ability to pause contracts](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=d20c8871-b7b2-4a87-b692-b84ef3331c60) for better tracking and support, ensuring funds are only received upon progress.\n\nHowever, the DAO must continue to enhance the quality and alignment of funded projects with Decentraland's goals. That's why, for this renewal, in addition to the usual tasks, we propose to focus on the following process improvements:\n\n**1) Support - Improvements**\n\n*   Systematize support flow for bids and tenders.\n*   Automate processes (e.g., onboarding emails, discord channels, end reports).\n*   Update the GSS Operational Manual.\n\n**2) Transparency and Accountability - Improvements**\n\n*   Improve tracking and presentation of impact metrics for projects supported by the DAO Treasury.\n*   Define the flow of how to review the Projects during their journey (adding technical reviews of projects with an Advisors / Board of experts).\n*   Simplify the grantees' required tasks.\n\n**3) DAO Grants and Bidding + Tender care Treasury - Improvements**\n\n*   Improve the Revocations Process.\n*   Ensure project delivery before cash out.\n\n**4) General Improvements**\n\n*   Analyze the value of projects funded per category and facilitate governance processes as needed (Categories and re-structure Budgeting).\n*   Increase the visibility of the DAO Grants Program.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur work involves ongoing support, guidance, analysis, and accountability for grant projects, aimed at enhancing the Grants Program. We're committed to transparency and have published a [GSS' Operations Manual](https://dcl-dao.notion.site/Grant-Support-Squad-Documentation-bc14cb2ffc0c4df18302bcffc6b60b2f), detailing our processes and daily tasks aligned with our goals\n\nIn the [roadmap](https://www.notion.so/dcl-dao/1a60cd1f92d742fa846c6fed9c9c2488?v=6aed029c885046e1b1b2aad7b64c0951\\&pvs=4) we are including the daily tasks explained above plus all the improvements for each area.\n\n**1) Support - Improvements**\n\n*   Systematize the Support Flow for bids and tenders.\n*   Automate processes (onboarding email, create discord Channels, end reports, etc)\n*   Update the GSS' Operational Manual.\n\n**2) Transparency and Accountability - Improvements**\n\n*   Track and display the impact metrics of the Projects: gather the info from the last 6 months and during the following period, analyze it and give feedback to the GovApp to display the information, Make a report.\n*   Technical reviews of the projects (Advisors / Board of experts): define the flow of reviewing the Projects during their journey.\n*   Optimize the Task management process of the Projects funded. How to show: the status of the projects, roadmaps, Financial reports and the Impact Metrics.\n*   Avoid duplicate efforts to the Grantees and the community members to review the information provided.\n\n**3) Take care of DAO Treasury - Improvements.**\n\n*   Improve the process of the Revocations Process: reduce the time of response + automate communications during the process.\n*   Improve the Payment process: ensure the project is delivered before cash out.\n\n**4) General Improvements**\n\n*   Grants Program Categories: Make a report to analyze the value per category + facilitate the governance process if it's needed.\n*   Grants Program Budgeting: Make a report to analyze the value per category + facilitate the governance process if it's needed.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x9937e3e274be96a624d7cd00f384eb71c741dd1b (Maryana)\n\nShould funds from the DAO Treasury be allocated to finance a new community-led project addressing issues outlined herein?\n\n## Linked Pitch Proposal\n[Holistic Improvement of Decentraland DAO Finances ](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b8f15209-19e7-4231-815b-d5fd2b1c0151)\n\n## Summary\n\nFor the last year, Decentraland DAO has been discussing how to improve its financial reporting, financial sustainability and secure its long-term financial future. This is an important decision, and community members have shared a variety of perspectives on how they wish to proceed.\n\nThis tender will launch a bidding process for the creation of a **Finance Support Service**. This will enable Decentraland DAO to take a significant step towards addressing the ongoing challenges; providing financial transparency; helping the DAO to become a more sustainable, prosperous organization.\n\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nDecentraland currently faces a number of major financial challenges, including:\n\n*   Monthly expenses surpass income\n*   Lack of diversity and strength of DAOs income streams\n*   Lack of robust financial reporting, planning and long-term budgeting\n*   Concerns around the efficacy of the grants program and spending\n*   Sell pressure on MANA and significant DAO dependence on the token.\n\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nThis tender invites service providers to provide a bid to become Decentraland’s **Finance Support Service** provider for a 6 month period.\n\nContributors and service providers are encouraged to place a bid that highlights their experience, role, and the responsibilities they would undertake. Service providers **can submit only one bid**. Services providers cannot, either directly or indirectly, deliver work as part of more than one bid (i.e. via a subcontracting relationship).\n\nSuitable contributors and service providers in this role should be qualified finance professionals able to demonstrate a track record of delivering financial work for web3 organisations and DAOs. Bid submissions for Finance Support Service must be made within two weeks of this tender process being successfully approved by VP holders.\n\nThis gives service providers and contributors the flexibility to design and propose a Finance Support Service which they feel best serves the needs of the DAO. In turn, the DAO will have the opportunity to review and ultimately decide which Financial Support Service bid is the most suitable for their needs.\n\n\n## Use Cases\n\nSuccessful delivery of the Finance Support Services would unlock a number of use cases and benefits for the DAO. This might include.\n\n*   Treasury Management will generate the single largest new revenue stream for DAO. This will fund ongoing DAO expenses in perpetuity and reduce them.\n*   Financial reporting and bookkeeping will improve decision-making, and transparency and increase accountability.\n*   Budget and Planning will improve resource allocation enable better financial management and increase the value of spend.\n*   Market Making and Treasury Management will reduce DAO's dependence on MANA. This will increase the stability, and resilience of the DAO in the face of market volatility.\n*   Finance Support Services will increase the impact of the DAO, reduce sell pressure on MANA and support price appreciation.\n\n\n## Deliverables\n\nBidders are encouraged to identify and propose those services and deliverables they feel would be of most value to the DAO.\nBids deliverables **may include** but are **not limited to**:\n\n*   Financial Reporting\n*   Bookkeeping\n*   Live Analytics Dashboards\n*   Market Making\n*   Budgeting and long-term financial planning\n*   Finance options assessments and recommendation reports\n*   Treasury Management\n\n\n## Target Release Quarter\n\n2024 Q3\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x0c678c84cc5744f2a5b368ce2aeab3905624ff99 (BitcoinETF)\n\nIn 2025 ICANN is opening up applications for new gTLD's (Generic Top-Level-Domains)\n\nRecently Ape (Bored Ape) community along with D3.inc submitted a proposal for .APE see below\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0x2b310aa9aa8fa1d955ca71ae454372229e663be6f3d7e513e9c0cc5b4f2d9fac\n\nI believe we should secure the .dcl Web2 domain name extension. I have already checked and .dcl is available.\n\nThere are many benefits associated by owning .dcl Top Level Domain\n\nSome of which are;\n\n*   Reaching 5+ Billion users\n*   Trusted & used by the worlds largest companies and brands\n*   Accredited by ICANN\n*   Universal compatibility\n*   Recurring revenue for Foundation from the renewals & sales\n*   Resolves to emails which opens the door for direct email marketing\n*   Open for all, not just Decentraland users. For those who missed out or couldn't register their desired .com .net .xyz .io may now have a chance of registering their desired names on .dcl or .mana\n*   Potential to bring in many new users through this inititative\n*   Easy, simple airdrops to all name holders via email click & claim marketing, thus bringing in potential new users.\n\nWe may choose to partner with D3.inc to follow similar path like .Ape or do all the work ourselves and keep it strictly within the Web2 ecosystem depending on the community votes.\nOverall cost would be around $500K\n\nMy personal opinion;\n\n*   This new Web2 gTLD is not to be used in-world & DAO\n*   This does not replace the current .dcl.eth naming system as it is strictly Web2 unless we decide to take a different approach like the Ape community\n*   We can assign privileges and or added utility for those who sign-in with .dcl name via magic which adds a gamification element and desire/urge to own a web2 .dcl name\n*   If we can manage to onboard these new users through L2 wearable free claims, airdops etc, this might work in our favour.\n*   Existing users may want to claim their corresdponding/desired Web2 names.\n*   Similar to .Ape the registration process will first open up to Decentraland users and then to the public. This factor alone should bring in additional new users if they really want to claim their names who previoulsy missed out on other extentions.\n*   Mass marketing potential through email marketing\n*   $500K might sound like alot but considering the fact $13M was spent on grants & the amount of new users onboarded proportinally, $500K suddenly seems like a miniscule number\n*   .dcl minimum registration is 1 year & maximum 10 years\n*   Registration fees to be kept minimal under $10 per year for all .dcl domains\n*   Decentraland Foundation to manage, & be in control of this new gTLD unless we want another 3rd party to get involved\n*   This will keep Decentraland active & innovative\n*   ENS domains gasless DNSSEC feature opened up new avenues for traditional Web2 DNS users to accept crypto payments. Maybe we can focus on how to get new users through this feature on .dcl\n*\n\nIf you have any opinions or would like to add anything drop it down below.\nIf the outcome of this proposal is positive we can take it to the next stage.\n\nIf you don't have anything constructive to say please refrain from wasting everyone's time. This goes for all alt acoount users inc HP\n\nPlease Vote; Yes or No\n\n- Yes\n- No \n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This upgraded version is called the **IWB Game Creator**.\n\n**We are limited by the inputs of the Grant Request form, so please visit the links below!**\n\n**Proposal Document**\nhttps://shorturl.at/npEK8\n\n**Presentation Deck**\nhttps://shorturl.at/itMU3\n\n**Highlight Video**\nhttps://shorturl.at/hxABQ\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n122,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n5 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe96f1c6B08b1d932Df11E78A040a75B546ab8d2B\n\n## Email address\n\nlastraum@lastslice.co\n\n## Description\n\n**Vision**\nOur vision for the IWB Game Creator is to enable anyone to become a game creator. We want to lower the barriers for creating engaging and dynamic experiences within Decentraland. We imagine tons of Decentraland Worlds populated with many different game types - from shooters to scavenger hunts, from races to mazes -  all created by Decentraland users without having to code one line.\n\n**Problem**\n**TL,DR**: There isn’t any “addictive” or “repetitive” content within Decentraland. It’s tough to create scenes, there are other metaverses making it easier to create and play within their platform, and there’s not enough reason (content) for people to stay or come back.\n\nThere are few problems within the current Decentraland ecosystem:\n\n*   The first being a high level requirement for coding experiences. Prior to the In World Builder, an extensive knowledge of the Decentraland SDK and/or other coding practices were required to develop even a simple live stream scene.\n*   Currently, Decentraland is having a hard time retaining both creators and users. The difficulty to create engaging and interactive experiences has taken a toll on the growth and activity of the platform. The lack of engaging content has driven users to other metaverse platforms and the creators have followed.\n*   Incentivization, or lack there of - both from a creator perspective and a user perspective\n\n**Solution**\nWith the IWB Game Creator, We are going to create multiple different game systems which can be clicked and placed within your Decentraland scene INSIDE Decentraland. These game systems will be complimentary to the extensive catalog of 3d assets already available in IWB.\n*ex. Imagine wanting to create a maze game. With IWB Game Creator, pick and place your environment assets from the IWB Catalog; choose and drop your puzzle pieces and clues along the maze route; add a timer for competitive gameplay; determine your win conditions and rewards. Click create and your game is immediately available to play by all visitors to your World!*\n\nEach game system will have additional customizations for the creator to vary game play. We will have 3 high level game loops that can be further customized to create many different game modes.\n**Game Systems**\n\n*   Time Based System - *Mazes, escape rooms, parkour, races, scavenger hunts*\n*   Combat System - *shooters, deathmatches, battle royales, king of the hill*\n*   Wave System - *duck hunt, asteroid, enemy wave shooter, arcade shooter*\n\n**Templates**\nInclude the “free sample” templates along with the ingredients for these games. (ie. a complete maze game, a complete pvp arena for deathmatch…)\n\n**Summary**\nWe have built the foundation for creators to build amazing scenes and experiences without coding knowledge or 3d modeling experience all done INSIDE Decentraland with the In World Builder. The IWB Game Creator makes it easy to create interactive games and experiences with the click of a button. Our goal with the IWB Game Creator is to achieve the “addictive” and “repetitive” gamer behavior  through simple, yet powerful games.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n|Task  |  Time | Notes |\n|--|--|--|\n| UX Conceptualization & Design | Month 1 | Heavy focus on UX to develop the most user-friendly solution\n| Asset Creation | Month 1 | Begin development of new assets including 3D models, animations, smart items and more for each game system\n| Core System Architecture | Month 1 | building the essential framework, data models, and scene configuration\n| Core Back End Services | Month 1,2,3 | Communication layer scene <- -> colyseus <- -> playfab\n| Core Scene Code Design | Month 2,3,4 | Design the scene code to be modular and upgradeable\n| Final Testing and Launch | Month 4,5 | Testing & refinement, public release, seamless UX day one\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x5b5cc427c1d81db4f94de4d51d85ce122d63e244 (Fehz)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Open Source all code generated using DAO funds](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=26d96924-5c53-48d6-9309-d6925233e827)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe governance proposal outlines the specifics of making open-sourcing a prerequisite for grant approval and designating the Decentraland DAO public GitHub repository for code storage.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal advocates for a significant shift in the approach of this DAO for its Grants Program by requiring that all projects funded through DAO resources make their code open source.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDecentraland DAO Grants Program has already allocated $13,272,124.00 to different projects since its creation. As of the beginning of 2023 open-sourcing the code was made a [requirement](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=77475620-7b74-11ed-ad27-015f26e7c35c) for the **Platform** category. Prior to 2023 and up till today, across all other categories, only a limited number of projects were open source and/or accessible to the community, with some of them even quitting and not creating value for the environment.\n\nTo avoid that happening, it has become evident that there is a clear need to mandate that all grant recipients publish their project code in a manner that is accessible to every creator seeking to build, advance, and enhance their projects and the platform as a whole. The barriers to entry are already too high for new creators; open-sourcing and maintaining a public repository will help to make it easier for new creators to be onboarded and for existing projects to enhance their performance and content.\n\nAll code produced with DAO funds should start being considered in terms of ‘public goods’ from now on, promoting the idea of collaboration and the ethos of decentralization of the project, fostering the modular growth of the ecosystem. The GSS has created a DAO Github REPO as a repository for [DAO Platform Grants](https://github.com/Decentraland-DAO/grants), and it can be used for all grants.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n*   Code under GNU GPL-2.0 or GPL-3, Apache 2.0, MIT or public domain\n*   Images, documentation, videos, 3D models (or any other non-code assets) under Creative Commons Version 4.0, either CC-BY, CC-BY-SA or CC0 (public domain)\n*   Any code developed before or without DAO funding is optional and not required to be open source, with the exception of code that is required for the scene to work (e.g. a scene that necessitates a server - that server should be opensourced even if developed before the grant, else the scene isn't usable).\n*   .env vars/custom APIs/databases can be considered private and no need for open source for security.\n*   If the project uses proprietary services such as AWS, Azure, GCP to manage the server or Playfab to host the server, the grantee must provide a setup guide for it to be replicated. If the server can be hosted anywhere, via a docker image for example, this is not necessary.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\n*   Accessibility and inclusive environment for creators while embracing the ethos of decentralization.\n*   Public and easy to access available repositories\n*   Enables better scalability and modular growth\n*   Increased accountability, transparency and security\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n*   From the date of approval of this governance proposal, all projects seeking funds from the DAO must commit to open-sourcing their code as a mandatory condition (this includes both Grants Program and Bidding & Tendering Process)\n*   All code generated using DAO funds must be hosted in the Decentraland DAO public GitHub repository (https://github.com/decentraland-dao), which will be overseen by the Grant Support Squad. GitHub repository set up will be a part of the onboarding process.\n*   The Grant Support Squad will possess the authority to establish the pathway and specifications necessary to manage and ensure the open-sourcing of projects within the designated GitHub repository.\n*   Failure to open source code or maintain the GitHub repository up-to-date may result in an immediate pause and potential revocation of a grant.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal marks a significant step towards transparency, collaboration, and value-driven development within the DAO Grants program. Open-sourcing of code will promote a more accessible and inclusive environment for creators while embracing the ethos of decentralization.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Limit Grants Re-Submissions",
    "body": "> by 0x5b5cc427c1d81db4f94de4d51d85ce122d63e244 (Fehz)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Limit grants re-submission to 2 every 6 months](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=541d6c80-c9b8-4175-8f92-d477bca5017b)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to set conditions on resubmitting grant requests based on prior rejections or revocations.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nIn order to re-submit a previously rejected grant request there should be additional efforts to leverage that first negative voting outcome. Moreso, grantees with revocations on their record shouldn’t be able to request grants if that revocation was due to lack of compliance or substandard grant performance.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis initiative has the purpose to contribute to a more transparent and community-driven Grants Program as well as a more balanced and reliable voting system. Acknowledging negative voting outcomes as strong community expressions and revocations as severe precedents with consequences are two steps forward in order to avoid voter-fatigue and develop further accountability on a delicate matter such as funds allocations.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo implement the following requisites upon grants requests:\n\n**1. Previously rejected request**: In order to re-submit a grant request that has been previously rejected the new proposal must include a minimum 30% reduced budget compared to the original and/or a redefined scope based on community feedback. If it's rejected again the grantee won’t be able to request a grant for 6 months.\n\n*   If the original proposal ended up with a majority voting in favor but failed to reach the VP threshold the user will be able to resubmit the proposal unmodified up to one additional time. If it fails again the user won’t be able to request a grant within a 6 month period.\n*   If the grant proposal successfully passes the voting stage, the Revocations Committee will instruct the DAO Committee not to execute or establish the vesting contract associated with the grant.\n*   In the exceptional circumstance that a grant has already passed and the vesting contract is active, immediate action will be taken not to execute the vesting contract.\n*   If either the original proposal or the modified proposal are presented by any other user the 6 month restriction will apply to that user as well.\n\n**2. Revoked**: If a user has had a revoked grant due to lack of compliance or substandard grant performance it’ll be unable to request grants for a 6 month period.\n\n*   The Revocations Committee must include either “Able to request grants” or “Not able to request grants” within its revocation statement pointing out the reason for revocation. In case the revocation was due to applying to the wrong category or any other procedural matter the restriction won’t apply but the clarification has to be done.\n\n**Implementation**\nUpon approval the GSS will incorporate and adapt their Manual of Operations to meet this new criteria and the Revocations Committee will make the necessary changes to their process as well. The Governance Squad will ensure an archive system for proposals instead of deletion in order to keep a visible track of re-submissions.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs our DAO continues to discuss core issues such as grant requests and VP distribution we believe this proposal is a step in the right direction. Honoring votes and increasing transparency and accountability are the main drivers of this initiative that is now up for the community to decide on.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Allow building simple Websites on top of Decentraland Names",
    "body": "> by 0xbc02db030361121dd43bbb2fcbcb4f9f98c1dc7d (Jedi)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Allow building simple Websites on top of Decentraland Names](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a487e27e-f687-4b70-a1be-2acb7fa4a911)\n\n## Summary\n\nAllow building simple Websites on top of Decentraland Names.\n\nThere are two options to choose from\n\n1 - Incorporate this feature into current website decentraland.org\n\n2 - Incorporate this feature into dcl.gg\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal is a small adjustment to recently passed Governance Proposal. See blow.\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4112f98e-d360-4a8a-9153-a193976113bd\n\nUnder the specifications there is a option for Simple one page Landing pages or Webpages function. I would like this to be extended from one page to 5 or 10 pages for building websites. Considering the average desktop webpage is 2.2 Mb and average mobile webpages are 2 Mb, I say we can allocate some of the 100 Mb given to DCL names for this implementation.\n\nI believe this keeps us innovative and seeing how the digital identities and decentralised domain names have become more relevant in the recent years, this will be a great addition and perhaps an even greater marketing strategy for Decentraland.\nShould DCL Names have the option to build 5-10 page websites?\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDigital Identity should be more than just converting 42-character hexadecimal addresses into a human readable names.\n\nIf we want to stay innovative we must go above & beyond what others are doing. There are a bunch of Free Web3 names names including Uniswap's uni.eth & Pudgy Penguins pudgy.eth. To be honest in terms of utility they don't provide anything fancy beside being a human readable wallet address. Decentraland names on the other hand are extremely unique and are packed with built-in utility.\n\nOne of them is the \"Worlds\" as you all might now. However it seems the overall impact we received from activating the Worlds hasn't been too succesful.\n\nSo far there are 750 \"Worlds\" deployed on 40K .dcl.eth names and\n\n54 \"Worlds\" deployed on 3.2M .eth names\n\nI wouldn't call this a great success as the numbers speak for themselves. Nothing to brag about TBH.\n\nI believe Decentraland names possess more potential & are the gateway for the platforms mass adoption.\n\nMy suggestion is to allow building simple websites on top of Decentraland names. This feature will grab the attention of Web2 users specifically. Which is what we want because our target potential users are non-crypto native Web2 users.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThere will be two options to choose from based on the community votes.\n\n1 - Incorporate this feature into current website decentraland.org\n\n2 - Incorporate this feature into dcl.gg\n\nOption 1\n\nIncorporate this feature into current website decentraland.org\n\nBy choosing this option our team will incorporate website building functions and features along with deploying functionality all within decentraland.org\n\nMy thoughts on Option 1: Decentraland.org is a full blown website with so many links, slides info etc. which can be little overwhelming for a new user to navigate. Sharing the website tied to dcl name may be very long & not easy to remember unless it can be re-directed.\n\nOption 2\n\nIncorporate this feature into dcl.gg\n\nBy choosing this option our team will incorporate website building functions and features along with deploying functionality all within dcl.gg\n\nMy thoughts on Option 2: dcl.gg is an excellent domain name and gg is a gamer tag which stands for \"Good Game\" I'm pretty sure we all knew that. Thinking if dcl.gg makes sharing the website url shorter this might also be a good solution. i.e. jedi.dcl.gg or dcl.gg/jedi\n\nPlease note; regardless of which option the community chooses, this will be all tied to DCL names. One name per website. Website to be very simple & not have any e-commerce features.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nIn my opinion this inititave, feature or added funtionality keeps us innovative from the others. Also seeing how digital identities & decentralized domains have become more relevant in the recent years, this will be a great addition to and perhaps an even greater marketing strategy for Decentraland.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThere are a few ways in how this can ne implemented. One is to implement it on the current website www.decentraland.org and the other option is to implement it on dcl.gg website.\n\nRegardless of the option, accessing these websites should be simple & frictionless. Perhaps not even requiring a crypto wallet. That is of course if we agree that our target is non-crypto native Web2 users.\n\nThis can be done with email or maybe similar to current website revamp where there are multiple sign-in options. Crypto & Social sign-in.\n\nOur Foundation team has all the tools & expertise to bring this into reality. Perhaps we can garner other communities to come to DCL through this initative. Meaning anyone who is looking or wanting to build a simple website where they don't have to pay for hosting, yearly renewals etc..\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOverall I believe this is a great proposal for Decentraland. Perhaps this can drive additional traffic from other centralized Web2 social platforms into DCL.\n\nWould be a great way to share across all social platforms & if it gains attractions others would want to use it on their social as a link similar to Linktree for example.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

By requiring reporting on key performance indicators, the DAO can ensure transparency, accountability, and effectiveness of funded projects, ultimately fostering a culture of data-driven decision-making and maximizing the impact of community contributions.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe proposal is necessary to address the need for standardized reporting on the impact of projects funded through the DAO Grants program or the Bidding and Tendering process.\nCurrently, there needs to be more visibility into the outcomes and effectiveness of these projects, making it challenging for the community to assess their success or identify areas for improvement.\nWithout clear reporting requirements, it is difficult to determine whether the allocated funds are being used efficiently and whether the projects are achieving their intended goals. Establishing a framework for reporting impact metrics will enable the DAO to track the progress of funded initiatives, identify successful strategies, and allocate resources more effectively in the future.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed policy requires all projects funded through the DAO Grants program or Bidding and Tendering process to regularly report on their impact metrics.\n\n*   Grantees will be required to provide detailed information on key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to their project's objectives, according to the category selected (Grants Program) or as set out in the Bid.\n*   Reports will need to be submitted at predefined intervals, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually, depending on the duration and scope of the project. Additionally, grantees will be expected to provide qualitative insights and analysis to contextualize the quantitative data, demonstrating the project's overall impact on the Decentraland or/and DAO ecosystem.\n*   Failure to comply with reporting requirements will be a revocation cause.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the proposal to require reporting of impact metrics for projects funded through the DAO Grants program or Bidding and Tendering process addresses the critical need for accountability and transparency in the Decentraland ecosystem. By setting the systematic measurement and reporting of project outcomes, the DAO will ensure that resources are being allocated effectively and projects align with community goals.\nThis initiative will empower community voters to make data-driven decisions, drive innovation, and maximize investments' positive impact on Decentraland's development.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Aimed at bridging the gap between design and development, this tool eliminates the need for extensive coding knowledge, making the process of creating engaging and interactive UIs accessible to a broader range of creators.\n**Current Challenges:** The existing workflow for developing UIs in Decentraland involves a multi-step process where designers conceptualize UIs using graphic design tools like Canva or Figma, followed by developers translating these designs into code. This workflow is not only time-consuming but also requires a specific skill set, limiting the number of individuals who can contribute to creating interactive experiences in Decentraland.\n**Solution:** The Decentraland No-Code UI Design Studio simplifies this workflow by providing an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that allows users to select, customize, and integrate a wide range of UI elements directly into Decentraland scenes. This tool is designed to:\n\n*   Enhance Accessibility: By removing the coding barrier, this will open up UI creation to non-programmers, significantly expanding the pool of potential creators.\n*   Increase Efficiency: This tool streamlines the UI design process with pre-built elements and templates, as well as user uploaded custom graphics, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment of ideas. This efficiency is particularly beneficial for larger teams, reducing the workload on developers and allowing designers to take a more active role in the UI creation process.\n*   Facilitate Collaboration: Introduce features that enable collaboration among multiple creators, allowing teams to work together seamlessly on a single UI project.\n*   Customize with Ease: The tool offers comprehensive customization options for each UI element, ensuring that creators can fully realize their vision without compromise.\n*   Technical Implementation and Community Engagement: Built using Next.js and hosted on Vercel, the tool promises excellent performance and accessibility. Committed to community involvement and sustainability, the plan is to open-source the entire codebase, allowing for continuous improvement and customization by the community. The tool will be hosted for the first year, ensuring its availability and reliability, and subsequently, we will encourage the DAO community to take over its hosting or individuals can always run it locally on their own computer, depending on its value and utility to the community.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Q2 2024**\n\n*   Basic UI Elements: Develop essential UI elements (buttons, labels, input fields).\n*   Enhance Drag-and-Drop: Improve user interaction with a smooth interface and preset grid systems.\n*   Initial Customization: Enable basic element customization (color, size).\n*   Alpha Release: Launch for early feedback from a select group.\n\n**Q3 2024**\n\n*   Advanced Customization: Add advanced element customization (flex directions, aligning items, justifying content, margins, etc.), drop down menus, dynamic UIs and button events.\n*   Preset drag-and-drop social media UI links.\n*   Beta Testing: Open beta for Decentraland DAO community to refine features.\n*   Collaboration Prototype: Develop initial collaborative design functionalities.\n\n**Q4 2024**\n\n*   Preset Designs: Introduce preset UI designs for quick customization.\n*   Custom Designs: Allow users to upload their own custom designs including sprite sheets.\n*   Public Release: Officially launch the tool, incorporating beta feedback.\n*   Collaboration Launch: Integrate full collaboration features.\n*   Enable optional account creation to save, continue, as well as share work progress (using it as a guest will always be available)\n\n**Q1 2025**\n\n*   Feedback Integration: Enhance user experience based on community input.\n*   Expand Library: Add new elements and templates as requested by users.\n*   Community Contributions: Encourage user contributions to the UI library.\n*   Educational Initiatives: Offer tutorials and documentation for all skill levels.\n\nProgress will be shared through regular updates on Decentraland Forum, Discord, and GitHub. These updates will include detailed documentation related to both the no-code UI application and its underlying source code, live question-and-answer sessions and video demonstrations, including how to integrate it with your Decentraland project. This approach is designed to actively engage the community, solicit valuable feedback, and ensure transparency throughout the development process.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x5b5cc427c1d81db4f94de4d51d85ce122d63e244 (Fehz)\n\nShould funds from the DAO Treasury be allocated to finance a new community-led project addressing issues outlined herein?\n\n## Linked Pitch Proposal\n[Moderation Handover](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=572da3dc-2057-4595-89d3-9a38a81d5dfa)\n\n## Summary\n\nModeration is a key role within the community as it ensures that participation is framed within basic coexistence principles which naturally demands gatekeepers for its enforcement and oversight. Opening the role for the community to decide on who should be the ones taking this responsibility is something we consider is time for, being the Bid and Tendering process the best way to proceed in that direction.\n\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nAs we continue to evolve into a more cohesive and active community we believe it’s time to re-think some of the key roles within the DAO while keeping a welcoming and safe environment that brings the best out of all members. In that spirit, we are proposing a new strategy for moderation.\n\nA first groundbreaking step was the enactment of the Code of Ethics. Its principles and guidelines are now present within the DAO and its application has been visible when needed. As a second step, it is now up for the community to leverage this learning process and decide upon new individuals to continue fulfilling task, bringing new perspectives and thrust within the specifications of this proposal.\n\nAfter the Facilitation Squad grant is over the appropriate onboarding to the selected team will be done. This will include granting required permissions, status and walkthrough tools and processes. Once the knowledge sharing is concluded, the new team will be fully operative in its functions.\n\n\n## Technical Specification\n\n**GUIDELINES & SLA**\nThe moderation team will work by the following operational guidelines and per the following SLA.\n\n*   Managing Code of Ethics within a wide-ranging scope of application, encompassing not only the official Decentraland DAO Discord server but also all other instances that are linked to the Decentraland DAO such as the Forums, the Governance Platform and in-world in Decentraland (i.e DAO Headquarters).\n*   Applying disciplinary sanctions according to what’s stated in CoE chapter IV. and backing every action with sufficient motivation and proof/evidence.\n*   Keeping an updated record of actions on a public document.\n*   Guaranteeing a “follow the sun” model and (~24 hours presence).\n*   Actively cleanup channels and take action against spam/scam accounts.\n*   Monthly written reporting on activity, actions and relevant information for the DAO.\n*   Overseeing CoE validity and proposing modifications and enhancements if required.\n\n**REQUISITES**\nAs an exclusive requisite, none of the proposed team members must have any record of disciplinary sanction (T.O, Strike or detected Alt Account). We expect a clean record of those in charge of the moderation role, which is nothing less than people with high ethical standards that live by the example\n\nSpecific accounts can be created to fulfill the role but in any case identity disclosure of all team members with the Core Units and DAO Committee will be required in order to advance in the process. This is requested as per security measures.\n\n\n## Use Cases\n\nThe Moderation Team will be responsible for what is specified in the Technical Specifications sections and its actions framed within the CoE scope of application.\n\n\n## Deliverables\n\n*   Updated and public actions log\n*   Monthly reporting on activity\n*   Enhancements program if applied\n\n\n## Target Release Quarter\n\n2024 Q3\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xc53e74d0ad1601ac02e2e1bc71823819512f9192 (r3genavantgarde)\n\nShould the problem/opportunity outlined be refined and taken to the next level?\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe Decentraland Community faces challenges that are threatening the long-term financial sustainability of the DAO. These include negative P\\&L month by month, lack of income stream diversity, sub-optimal financial reporting and planning, ineffective grants program, continuous sell pressure on MANA, and lack of robust treasury management. While these challenges are common across many DAO and can be resolved with the right corrective actions, the financial future of the DAO may be at risk without immediate intervention.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nHire service providers with the right skillset, comprising experts from Avantgarde (https://avantgarde.finance) and r3gen finance (https://r3gen.finance) to address the identified financial challenges. These contributors will focus on financial reporting, budgeting & planning and treasury management. r3gen will provide Big-4 accounting expertise, while Avantgarde will leverage its treasury management capabilities. The implementation of the treasury management will be conducted on Enzyme (https://enzyme.finance), a DeFi protocol that is best-in-class for control, transparency and trustless delegation.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nThe primary audience for this proposal is the Decentraland DAO community, key stakeholders, and delegates. r3gen and Avantgarde aim to gather feedback and build consensus among stakeholders to ensure alignment with the DAO's long-term objectives.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nThe current challenges facing the Decentraland DAO necessitate swift action. With monthly expenses surpassing income, lack of income stream diversity, and inefficiencies in financial reporting and planning, the DAO's financial future is in jeopardy. Establishing a service agreement now will enhance financial transparency, optimise treasury funds, and support the sustainability and growth of the Decentraland metaverse. By addressing these challenges now, the DAO can secure its financial future and enhance its long term impact, prosperity, and success.\n\nFor the full fledged proposal, please read more here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pzg6LgqswNBZTbIkvgXUWBQC2c_DZfS-GtS50sa0Mqo/edit?usp=sharing\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x895be97bdb9f8a244c472b18ea96dee39ddf8fe5 (dax)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Should the Revocation Committee have 5 total members instead of 7?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=dff4a650-6a1f-44d0-8711-02726d229f81)\n\n## Summary\n\nShould the Revocation Committee have 5 total members instead of 7?\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nSince 2023-07-07, the Revocation Committee has had 6 cases. In that time we've gathered enough information and experience to agree on some changes to improve how the revocation process works, the full text of which we will publish in the near future.\n\nOne of those ideas is to shrink the Revocation Committee from 7 total member slots (5 active members and 2 substitutes) to 5 total member slots (3 active members and 2 substitutes).\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe believe that having 7 total member slots is not necessary based on the workload that we have had and the processes we have already put into place. Furthermore, we anticipate that the workload going forward will be lighter than it was in the past months as there is no longer a backlog of cases to decide on.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nInstead of 7 total members for the revocation committee to be considered full, we suggest that 5 total members be considered full.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nI believe the major impact is a less complicated voting process (as fewer people need to be elected in total). In terms of actual impact to the current process, there will be little - we currently only have 4 members, so we're not even dropping anyone, just lowering the max member count.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nWhen the time comes for revocation committee elections, we should aim to fill 5 total spots rather than 7.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs we believe that 5 members can handle the workload of the Revocation Committee\ngoing forward, we suggest that this be officially amended.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xbc02db030361121dd43bbb2fcbcb4f9f98c1dc7d (Jedi)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Allow the option for building a 5-10 page websites out of DCL Names ](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=97c10d0d-aa5d-4fc2-bc45-6a813bfe2e71)\n\n## Summary\n\nAllow building simple Websites on top of Decentraland Names.\n\nThere are two options to choose from\n\n1 - Incorporate this feature into current website decentraland.org\n\n2 - Incorporate this feature into dcl.gg\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal is a small adjustment to recently passed Governance Proposal. See blow.\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4112f98e-d360-4a8a-9153-a193976113bd\n\nUnder the specifications there is a option for Simple one page Landing pages or Webpages function. I would like this to be extended from one page to 5 or 10 pages for building websites. Considering the average desktop webpage is 2.2 Mb and average mobile webpages are 2 Mb, I say we can allocate some of the 100 Mb given to DCL names for this implementation.\n\nI believe this keeps us innovative and seeing how the digital identities and decentralised domain names have become more relevant in the recent years, this will be a great addition and perhaps an even greater marketing strategy for Decentraland.\nShould DCL Names have the option to build 5-10 page websites?\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDigital Identity should be more than just converting 42-character hexadecimal addresses into a human readable names.\n\nIf we want to stay innovative we must go above & beyond what others are doing. There are a bunch of Free Web3 names names including Uniswap's uni.eth & Pudgy Penguins pudgy.eth. To be honest in terms of utility they don't provide anything fancy beside being a human readable wallet address. Decentraland names on the other hand are extremely unique and are packed with built-in utility.\n\nOne of them is the \"Worlds\" as you all might now. However it seems the overall impact we received from activating the Worlds hasn't been too succesful.\n\nSo far there are 750 \"Worlds\" deployed on 40K .dcl.eth names and\n\n54 \"Worlds\" deployed on 3.2M .eth names\n\nI wouldn't call this a great success as the numbers speak for themselves. Nothing to brag about TBH.\n\nI believe Decentraland names possess more potential & are the gateway for the platforms mass adoption.\n\nMy suggestion is to allow building simple websites on top of Decentraland names. This feature will grab the attention of Web2 users specifically. Which is what we want because our target potential users are non-crypto native Web2 users.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThere will be two options to choose from based on the community votes.\n\n1 - Incorporate this feature into current website decentraland.org\n\n2 - Incorporate this feature into dcl.gg\n\nOption 1\n\nIncorporate this feature into current website decentraland.org\n\nBy choosing this option our team will incorporate website building functions and features along with deploying functionality all within decentraland.org\n\nMy thoughts on Option 1: Decentraland.org is a full blown website with so many links, slides info etc. which can be little overwhelming for a new user to navigate. Sharing the website tied to dcl name may be very long & not easy to remember unless it can be re-directed.\n\nOption 2\n\nIncorporate this feature into dcl.gg\n\nBy choosing this option our team will incorporate website building functions and features along with deploying functionality all within dcl.gg\n\nMy thoughts on Option 2: dcl.gg is an excellent domain name and gg is a gamer tag which stands for \"Good Game\" I'm pretty sure we all knew that. Thinking if dcl.gg makes sharing the website url shorter this might also be a good solution. i.e. jedi.dcl.gg or dcl.gg/jedi\n\nPlease note; regardless of which option the community chooses, this will be all tied to DCL names. One name per website. Website to be very simple & not have any e-commerce features.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOverall I believe this is a great proposal for Decentraland. Perhaps this can drive additional traffic from other centralized Web2 social platforms into DCL.\n\nWould be a great way to share across all social platforms & if it gains attractions others would want to use it on their social as a link similar to Linktree for example.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (coalition)\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nThe proposal aims to rethink the DAO Delegation and Voting system to reward community engagement and increase accountability, representation. This could include introducing a dedicated, separate Delegates-Voters section on the governance website, establishing incentives and rewards and creating a structured framework for Delegates areas of responsibilities within Decentraland DAO.\n\n**MOTIVATION**\n\nCurrent delegation and voting system can be limited by lack of incentives, clear operating manuals and metrics for evaluation and visibility. Modifying the system will reward stakeholders, improve governance processes, and stimulate DAO participation.\n\n**POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**\n\n*   Delegates Section: Create a separate comprehensive section on the governance website detailing Delegates/Voters profiles, areas of governance, contributions and other stats/metrics.\n\n*   Incentives and Rewards: Introduce incentives for both Delegates/Voters and Delegators. Incentives could be vouchers for free NAMES registrations, wearables submissions or a percentage of DAO revenue or other.\n\n*   Rating/Tier System: Implement a delegates/voters rating system based on contributions, activity, and community feedback, leveraging the DAO badges system.\n\n*   Programs: Specify delegates/voters programs and governance areas, aligning delegates with DAO strategic direction.\n\n*   COE Agreement: Require delegates to adhere to an existing code of ethics, with public declarations of agreement.\n\n*   Stakeholder Representation: Clearly define the stakeholders each delegate represents, ensuring diverse community interests are addressed. (Content creators, LAND/NAME/ MANA holders etc)\n\n*   KPIs and Stats: Develop comprehensive KPIs for delegates/voters to measure performance and impact within the DAO.\n\n*   Evaluation and Feedback: Introduce a feedback mechanism for continuous assessment and community input on delegate performance.\n\n*   Rotation and Term Limits: Implement term limits and rotation policies to encourage fresh perspectives and prevent power consolidation.\n\n*   VP Pool: Establish a pool to distribute voting power to active and contributing delegates/voters, enhancing their governance impact.\n\n*   Specializations: Categorize Delegates/Voters  based on expertise areas.\n\n*   Guidelines: Framework with scope of work fulfilled in a structured process with clear benchmarks, methodologies and rules.\n\n*   Mission Requests: Enabling Delegates and Voters to propose specific missions-proposals aligned with the DAO's strategic objectives. This section could facilitate community-driven initiatives that support governance, financial, marketing efforts, and other key DAO areas of interest. Proposals should be actionable, with clear objectives and timelines, and must demonstrate how they contribute to the overarching goals of the DAO. A structured review process will assess proposals for alignment with strategic priorities, feasibility, and potential impact on the Decentraland and DAO.\n\n**VOTING OPTIONS**\n\nYES: Revamp Delegation-Voting System.\n\nNO: Leave as it is.\n\nThis is a non-binding pre-proposal poll to assess community sentiment. If approved, feedback and insights will be solicited to refine and finalize the points.\n\n- YES\n- NO\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This includes following up with the community’s feedback on the forum and making changes.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur roadmap for building the Decentraland Community and Ecosystem Dashboard is as follows:\nDeveloping and publishing the dashboard.\nOur team creates a list of all the sources of information relevant to the Decentraland ecosystem (we usually collect 30+ sources including official blog posts, social media, discussion forums, podcasts, etc)\nWe build a draft dashboard that is composed of the widgets we think best serve the Decentraland community based on our experience building for other projects.\nWe share the dashboard with the Decentraland community and/or team and we collect feedback.\nWe change & iterate based on the feedback and once we get final approval from the community and/or team we publish it.\nWe also do social marketing campaigns to promote the dashboard\n2\\. Maintenance and Curation of dashboard over the long haul.\nWe continue to maintain, curate, and develop the dashboard continuously as well as keep in touch with the community via the forum.\nIf we get any early traction on the Decentraland dashboard we can immediately start to build more Decentraland-exclusive widgets.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xe945ed0530da54c1af15c6b034be9ef3e6bbe7b1 (OGContraBand)\n\nIn-world grants have been frozen which goes against the manifesto of improving and investing in in-world content.  Should the following monetization system replace in-world grants?\n\nSystem:\nRather than having grants DCL-Metrics are used to distribute in-world grant funds as a percentage of user traffic generated by lands and worlds.\n\nBenefits:\n1 - There is no future projection, failed projects, rugs - everything is retroactive and simple - you get users you get reward\n2 - Reduction of corruption.  Currently new user has zero percent change of getting a grant unless maybe they have a connection to a legislator or a million dollar bill in their back pocket.  New user does not have to appease the king and queen of Decentraland.\\\n3 - Expected explosive growth.  If you don't understand why this would create explosive growth then you never tried to make more than 10 dollars on something related to art.  People go wild for the change to make a few bucks on monetization - see youtube for an example.\n\nIf you do this as soon as possible Decentraland will be saved guaranteed.  Land sales will go wild and Mana will skyrocket.  Quite frankly those complaining about the platform just don't know how to code and problems solve.  Come out to 27,24 and you'll see someone can create a game as good as Nifty Island here.  Try the Laser Gun v1.7 you'll see cool MOBA, FBS games can be made here without any help or aid by a good programmer just reading the docs, programming and debugging.  Sure there are bugs, but currently there's work arounds and a way to get what you need to get done done here and create something amazing.\n\n- Yes - replace in-world grants with monetization\n- No \n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

By outlining a short procedure and enforcement measures to be adopted by the Revocations Committee, the DAO will oversee the invalidation or revocation of grants where self-voting occurs.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nSelf-voting introduces bias and undermines the principles of fairness that should govern the allocation of resources in a decentralized environment. Furthermore, it can lead to the misallocation of funds, hindering the progress of legitimate projects and moreover, damaging trust within the community. Therefore, it becomes imperative to establish mechanisms to prevent and address self-voting in grant proposals to uphold the integrity of the Decentraland DAO and protect the treasury.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n*   A “Conflicts of Interest” section will be added to the existing [FORMAL REQUEST TO RAISE DECENTRALAND GRANTS CONCERNS FORM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd63qjesnGcUa-m6HxHJfgouJhX46AT0UfQs7oszQIxdikA3A/viewform). All complaints should be submitted this way.\n\n*   For the invalidation of grant proposals submitted by authors or requestors voting for themselves, measures should be taken considering the following scenarios:\n    *   If a community member votes for their own grant request while the voting process is ongoing, the Revocations Committee will promptly notify the DAO Committee of the situation.\n    *   If the grant proposal successfully passes the voting stage, the Revocations Committee will instruct the DAO Committee not to execute or establish the vesting contract associated with the grant.\n    *   In the exceptional circumstance that a grant has already passed and the vesting contract is active, immediate action must be taken to pause and revoke the grant.\n\n*   Add self-voting as a violation to the CoE with corresponding sanctions/enforcement measures.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAdopting a procedure to stop self-voting is a first step towards tackling conflicts of interests within the DAO, and a concrete measure to protect the treasury and the funds allocated to the grants program, promoting higher standards of  fairness, transparency and accountability among community members.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Waiting 10 months for a foundation client is a foolish business blunder that will allow competitors to take market share.\n\nDCL's main advantage over the competition is being one of the first to market with a functional product, but being slow during a bull run will give our adversaries time to catch up by developing superior products.\n\nThe 2024 bull run is DCL's opportunity to grow. We have 6 years of budget left which is plenty. With a budget reduction we have over 10 years of budget left. What are the actual fixed costs of maintaining the DAO? Do we even have any big expenses besides grants that we would need the treasury to cover? The point of the treasury is the fund growth through the community.\n\nIf we freeze grants until 2025, the bull run might be over and we would have missed this rare opportunity to grow during favorable market conditions which only happens around once every 3 years.\n\nHaving a grant freeze won't even have the intended effect of saving MANA in the treasury as we will suffer the opportunity cost of not expanding the daily active user numbers during a bull run.\n\nDaily active users = price of MANA = value of the DAO treasury\n\nThe 8m VP whale is going to continue to veto anything he doesn't like anyways, so what's the risk of having a budget reduction instead of a grant freeze? The argument of a grant freeze stopping bad grants doesn't work because the platform category can still be abused if the 8m VP whale wasn't voting. Full transparency: I was voted down by this whale so I don't have much ambition of even getting a grant for myself.... I am worried about all the other small creators and the value of my investment in MANA as the main motivations for making this proposal.\n\nBoth a budget reduction and grant freeze would save 40% of the budget, so can someone please explain to me how reducing the budget is not the better option for a game that depends on motivated small creators?\n\nDoes Morph and Facemoon not deserve their small grants? Why did people who voted yes on the grant freeze turn around and vote yes for these small creators? Does DCL Brasil not deserve a grant because an 8m VP whale said so? Does metagamimall and soul magic not deserve a grant despite being some of the top daily scenes in DCL? Does VTATV and helpimstreaming not deserve a small grant? Does Bleace not deserve the opportunity to work 40-60 hours a week for the community at a reasonable price? Does Dollhouse not deserve a 2024 grant after years of hard work building the community into what it is today? This is crazy how we decided to stop supporting community creators in a game that is 100% dependent on the work of community creators.\n\nLet's keep things civilized and professional in the comments.... I'm genuinely wondering why the community voted for a grant freeze instead of a budget reduction that would have the exact same effect??\n\nIt is the same 40% either way......\n\nI don't understand why a budget reduction is not a better solution.... please someone explain this to me, thank you.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Abstain\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "New Wearable Rarity Tier: Exotic (50 mint/supply)",
    "body": "> by 0x56469159d91eb810dce34dd13ec4ed8194bca7be (NikkiFuego)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[New Wearable Rarity Tier: Exotic (50 mint/supply)](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f059d990-8ed2-11ed-aae5-394e6c1c2226)\n\n## Summary\n\n[Canny](https://decentraland.canny.io/marketplace/p/new-wearable-rarity-tier-exotic-50-mint) feature request. Per the Foundations request we are promoting it to the final stage of governance since this affects the smart contract.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nHaving to decide between 100 mint and 10 mint is often a really difficult decision. Not only for Wearable Creators but also for projects onboarding with Wearables. This last 2 years I have made over 200 wearables and the majority of those were with 3rd party entities looking to onboard onto the platform. It's always been a pain point trying to weigh the benefits of 100 vs 10. While 10 is very expensive because you have less wiggle room to give away for any promotional needs while 100 isn't quite exclusive enough for some projects and visions.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe addition of a new Exotic Rarity Tier (50 Mint) to the publishing options would be important and would help to solve a number of problems that currently exist within the platform.\n\nOne key benefit of adding a new Exotic Rarity Tier is that it would provide content creators with more flexibility and control over their creations. Currently, creators must choose between two Rarity Tiers: Common (100,000 Mint), Uncommon (10,000 Mint), Rare (5,000 Mint), Epic (1,000 Mint), Legendary (100 Mint), Mythic (10 Mint), and Unique (1 Mint). These options can be limiting for creators who want to produce a limited number of high-quality items that are not quite as rare as a 10 Mint item, but rarer than a 100 Mint item. By adding a 50 Mint Rarity Tier, creators would have a new option that falls between these two extremes, allowing them to more accurately reflect the value and rarity of their creations.\n\nAnother benefit of adding a new Rarity Tier is that it could help to address some of the issues related to scarcity and demand on the Decentraland platform. Currently, the Mythic (10 Mint) tier is highly coveted, and as a result, items at this tier are often sold at a premium price. This can create a situation where only the most financially well-off users are able to afford Rare items, which can lead to feelings of exclusivity and inequality within the community. By adding a 50 Mint Rarity Tier, there would be more options available to users who are looking for unique and valuable items but may not be able to afford the high prices of Rare items. This could help to create a more inclusive and equitable market for wearable items.\n\nFinally, the addition of a new Rarity Tier to the publishing options would be a valuable addition to the platform, providing content creators with more flexibility and control over their creations and helping to address issues related to scarcity and demand. It would also create more opportunities for users to find unique and valuable items that fit their budget and interests. When the user base grows again this will also provide another rare category for mass audiences.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe are proposing the addition to the option to submit Exotic (50 Mint) to the publishing pipeline. This tier would be put in between Legendary and Mythic tiers. As well as a new tab in the marketplace as shown in the example here: ![Img](https://i.imgur.com/148tLDt.png)\n\nIt is suggested that the rarity background color be Red as it is one of the few colors left that hasn't already been used. It is suggested that the name be \"Exotic\" to describe it's unique nature.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nAddition of the new Rarity Tier: Exotic would impact the way the current smart contract works as all rarity tiers are determined there. This would require a minor change to that contract to deploy the new tier.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe new rarity tier would be integrated in the following areas:\n\n*   Wearable submission interface. Selection menu of rarity types. Added in between Mythic and Legendary options.\n*   Marketplace rarity option filters. Added in between Mythic and Legendary options.\n*   Backpack filter and sorting mechanisms. Exotic wearables should be sorted in between Mythic and Legendary wearables.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we believe this addition of Exotic tier will provide new opportunities for creators to create interesting projects and provide an even more creative way to innovate new wearables. We believe this tier will also interest some other micro & macro communities that have yet to jump into Decentraland. **If there is anything that Doki and I can do to assist in the integration of this new tier we are willing to help!**\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Add GBM Auctions dApp as a stand-alone Decentraland auction house",
    "body": "> by 0x89a1d730aa1e78a0ede8dea988acecff0a6e99a9 (Szjanko)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Add GBM Auctions dApp as a stand-alone Decentraland auction house](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=df55f21a-f2b2-456b-ad12-e185d326705d)\n\n## Summary\n\nImplement GBM Auctions dApp as a stand-alone auction house for the Decentraland marketplace, where users can utilize Bid-to-Earn auctions to list and purchase their assets while earning $MANA whenever they are outbid.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Decentraland marketplace currently does not offer any type of auctioning. Auctions are a great price discovery tool for rarer items, ensuring sellers get the best market price. GBM Auctions is an incentivized auction mechanism where bidders make money when they are outbid- it’s a battle-tested product with over 70,000 auctions completed and over $200m in bidding volume. We believe the outcome of adding GBM will mean more activity on the marketplace, both for the buy and sell side and also better sales prices – all while members get a more rewarding experience earning $MANA.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, users can only sell for a fixed price using the Decentraland marketplace. This is not ideal, especially for rarer, more hard-to-value items- as it is difficult to come up with a starting price. Members either end up overpricing and not getting any traction, or under-pricing and leaving money on the table.\n\nA price discovery system like an auction fixes this, allowing the market to dictate the price. We propose utilizing GBM Auctions which is a gamified version for web3 assets specifically where bidders make money when they are outbid- introducing not only auctions into Decentraland but a Bid-to-Earn component too.\n\nThe game theory rockets activity as bidders are now incentivized to participate. It’s proven to generate more traffic and much higher sale prices- GBM’s existing partners have seen a 200% increase in sales price. For the bidders it also makes the experience more rewarding where they either win the item or earn $MANA.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe propose to use GBM Auction’s dApp as a stand-alone auction house. They can still sell via fixed price through the existing marketplace but now they also have a choice to use the separate auction house.\n\nThe dApp has the Bid-to-Earn bidding mechanism back end but also a front template which can be Decentraland branded to make it a more seamless experience. The fact that the front end is done already means the dApp is light effort to deploy. It can also be hosted as a subdomain, something like auctions.decentraland.org.\n\nIncentives are paid out in real time and in $MANA (or whichever currency the auction is listed in). Ultimately the incentives come out of the final sales price, however there is a degree of control a seller can have in deciding the maximum incentive they are willing to give.\n\nYou can see a full video demo specifically for Decentraland here\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/17a10b9f893045c78eec311ff442e8b9?sid=584be386-dd72-4198-9749-3e544fb36b71\n\nThere is no upfront investment required. No fixed costs or monthly running fees. GBM charges a 2% fee only on sales made through GBM auctions. Fixed-price sales and other non-GBM transaction methods are exempt from this fee. Full project management support is also included.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nWe envision the impact of utilizing the auction house dApp will be more activity both on the buy and sell side, as well as users simply having fun with the mechanic -keeping them returning. It can also serve as a new revenue stream for the Dao as well.\n\nFirst of all, it will be adding an auction feature which is currently missing from the marketplace, this in itself should get more people involved. The pitfalls of only having fixed price have already been described above.\n\nGBM takes this a step further, as it gamifies the bidding process where bidders make money when they are outbid. People are now incentivized to participate. Furthermore, the way the mechanism calculates the incentive payout is based on how much price discovery is being done- the higher a bidder places their bid from the current point, the higher their reward would be. This way it attracts more people into the auction as well nets better prices.\n\nWe can point to an empirical study that proved how the GBM auction system has a higher first bid, higher bids overall, a higher selling price, a higher revenue for the seller, fewer bids and takes less time to reach its final bid than an English auction.  You can find it here:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1r-Z8xS1MenfWrPwpXqpoQ0pkGjGqv5Cm/view?usp=sharing\n\nThere are also case studies with GBM’s previous clients:\n\nSongaday increased their revenues by 200%\nhttps://www.gbm.auction/case-studies/song-a-day\n\nAavegotchi increased their revenues by 160%\nhttps://www.gbm.auction/case-studies/aavegotchi\n\nCryptograph was able to price unpriceable assets created by major celebs/influencers like Vitalik Buterin and Paris Hilton\nhttps://www.gbm.auction/case-studies/cryptograph\n\nAnother positive impact is this becoming a new revenue stream for the DAO as they can add in their own transaction fee on the auction house. As more items are being listed for sale and being sold for a higher price, the DCL DAO can earn a % as well.\n\nThe worst case scenario in any auction, although unlikely with GBM due to their incentivization, is that a seller is not happy with the final price and does not want to part with their asset. The GBM dApp however has a solution- a cancellation feature. After an auction ends there is a grace period where the seller can cancel the auction if they are not happy with the price. They will have to pay out the accrued incentive costs, as well as any transaction fees – so there is an element of penalization as you would not want sellers to cancel too often leaving disgruntled buyers. It's also a way of finding the market value of their item at any given time, so there is a small cost associated- but does allow them to keep their asset if they are not happy with the final price.\n\nAn undesirable scenario could also be that the auction house is simply not used, however, this is again unlikely due to the reasons listed above and also would not be impactful as the community still has the choice to keep using the existing marketplace. Furthermore, there is no upfront investment required to set up the auction house so we can’t see a downside for this.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nRegarding implementation, firstly we would like to highlight that the GBM team is on hand to support. There are no extra charges for this.\n\nFor the implementation itself- we had initially begun this process by polling the community with 3 options.\n\nOption 1 was a deeper whitelabel integration which had GBM integrated directly within the current marketplace infrastructure. Option 2 was utilizing the GBM dApp as a standalone auction house. Finally, option 3 was not to implement at all.\n\nThere were in total 8.5m votes between options 1 and 2 and zero votes for not implementing at all, showing support from the community for an integration of some sort. The second stage of the governance procedure also received zero votes to abstain completely. From the first stage poll, the lighter lift option 2 was the ultimate winner.\n\nThe exact steps if the proposal should pass would be to get the Foundation access to the GBM codebase after an agreement is signed off.  GBM will also create a dedicated group with the relevant parties and include their CTO and wider tech team so there is ongoing communication. The dApp can be deployed and then hosted under a DCL subdomain.\n\nAuctions can be listed and incentives can be paid out in $MANA. Everything is done on chain, and on Polygon, so gas costs will also be negligible.\n\nThere are no upfront set-up costs, GBM only takes a 2% fee on the final winning bid so this reduces risk further. GBM's fee is paid automatically via smart contracts, so less admin is required.\n\nThe dApp route allows the quick pilot of a stand-alone DCL auction house and the process can also be done iteratively. If the results do end up being on par or better than GBM’s other clients then at that time we can look at a deeper white-label integration i.e. option1, and would have data by then to support this too.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe believe adding in the GBM Auction house dApp will make for a great addition to the existing marketplace, firstly by adding in an auction mechanism as well as a Bid-to-Earn gamified experience. This should have a big impact on activity, both on buying and selling and this has been proven from their existing clients and case studies already.\nGBM has completed over 70,000 auctions and is working with The Sandbox, Rarible, Unstoppable Domains and Aavegotchi just to name a few. The founders are fully doxxed and have been working in the blockchain space since 2018, whilst being involved as early as 2013.\n\nHugo McDonaugh, CEO, DCL Username ‘ObiWanKenobi’ - https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugomcdonaugh/\n\nEdouard Bessire, COO\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/edouardbessire/\n\nGuillaume Gonnaud, CTO\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaume-gonnaud/\n\nThroughout this governance process we’ve had high engagement and voting. With this level of enthusiasm, we believe the dApp will be used by the community and be a value add to the whole Decentraland ecosystem by increasing volumes and floor prices.\n\nThere is no cost to implement, they are happy to support integration and it does not force people to choose only this method, so we cannot see any down side.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The main goal of this team will be to keep sustaining and fostering creativity within the platform and safeguarding prior investments made by the DAO as well as lowering the barrier entry for new creators. Moreover, the team will be responsible for  facilitating effective communication between the Decentraland DAO and the Decentraland Foundation to enhance collaboration and provide support for technical inquiries and requests.\n\nThe proposal outlines a technical plan including not only support migration processes and bug resolution, but also collaborate and maintain the [SDK7 Goerli Plaza Repo](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-goerli-plaza) in coordination with the Foundation, as well as the enhancement and extension of libraries, for ensuring compatibility and innovation.\n\nWe want this to also mark the initiation of the DAO's efforts to recruit technical teams, aiming to improve the platform and provide more robust support for the entire community.\n\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nDecentraland Content Creators are currently facing a critical challenge with the transition to SDK7. Current scenario shows that from ~24.000 active scenes in Genesis City, for the ones that had at least one active user (in the last 3 months), 45% are deployed in SDK7, while 55% are still deployed in SDK6. The migration process involves significant changes, and without dedicated support, developers may face obstacles, leading to disruptions in project timelines, increased development costs, and potential user experience issues.\n\nMoreover, many projects which have been successful on previous SDK versions, now face the risk of complications that could render them obsolete in the short term. This situation not only jeopardizes the innovation and creativity these projects bring to the metaverse but also raises the specter of wasted funds that the DAO has previously invested in these projects.\n\n\n## Technical Specification\n\n**Basics requirements for presenting a bid**\n\n*   Verifiable background working with Decentraland\n*   Background & Portfolio\n*   Explanation of the approach the team will take to address each of the assigned responsibilities and tasks.\n*   Provide a list of three references, at least one of which is in the Decentraland community that can attest to your character and/or commitment to Decentraland.\n\n**Working Terms**\n\n**Overview & Scope of Work**\n\nThe migration process entails substantial changes, and without dedicated support, developers face obstacles that could lead to disruptions in project timelines, increased development costs, and potential user experience issues. The team’s scope of work must include a comprehensive technical plan, that contains the development, documentation, deployment of scenes migrated to the SDK7, and clear service level agreement.\n\n**Team Lead** - [FULL SCOPE OF WORK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ekV\\_-0cXYojYtxo3mZl3yboO4KQ3-EPP39ndUQbnQtU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nTeam lead will also fulfill a Technical Liaison role to facilitate effective communication between the Decentraland DAO and the Decentraland Foundation. This role will act as a bridge to enhance collaboration and provide support for technical inquiries and requests.\n\n**Migration, Bug Resolution y Libraries Enhancement**\n\n*   Migrate repositories to SDK7\n*   Technical guidance & support for migration\n*   On-demand assistance\n*   Deployment strategy\n\n**Workshops**\n\nDevelop, detail, and conduct a series of technical workshops focusing on SDK7.\n\n**Documentation**\n\nReview all SDK documentation (https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/). Fix and complete with Foundation’s review and approval\n\n**Support Hours & Response time (SLA)**\n\nThe team should be accessible for 6 hours each day during working days, both synchronously and asynchronously. The expected response time should fall within the range of 24 to 48 hours.\n\n**Communication Channels**\n\nThe team should have the capability to respond across various communication channels, such as Discord, Forums, and email for formal communication. The team will also update on their progress in the Monthly Townhalls. The team will work in public letting the community see their working pipeline and progress.\n\n**Conditions for Projects requesting migration assistance**\n\n*   Open-Source projects with their corresponding GitHub repo (https://github.com/decentraland-dao)\n*   Actively maintained\n*   Compliant with DCL Code of Ethics\n\n**Basic Metrics (with evidence) but not limited to**:\n\n*   Supporting Hours\n*   Bugs tracking, recording and reporting\n*   Supported Projects\n*   Migrated repos\n*   Documents updated\n*   Bugs resolved\n*   Satisfaction Survey each Q\n\n\n## Use Cases\n\n*   DAO-Foundation Collaboration\n*   Smooth SDK7 Migration\n*   Timely bug resolution\n*   Enhanced platform feature development\n*   Transparent documentation review\n*   Open-Source project support\n*   Lower entry barriers\n\n\n## Deliverables\n\n*   Roadmap (1st week after approval)\n*   6 Workshops\n*   Monthly reports\n\n\n## Target Release Quarter\n\n2024 Q2\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

In that spirit, we are proposing a new strategy for moderation.\n\nOver the past year, many efforts have been done towards this end, being the Code of Ethics our most tangible outcome. The CoE sets the bar for how we want to address our disputes and the minimum level of respect required to jump into any debate. This is not capricious, it’s a statement of core principles that we stand for and that require monitoring and gatekeeping.\n\nNaturally, this task comes with the responsibility of imparting disciplinary actions when required and this is something not to be taken lightly. Although guidelines and principles are stated, there’s judgment calls to be made in every action in order not to escalate or roadblock a valid exchange. Although this sense of righteousness of the moderation role is often perceived as partial or biased, it's something inherent to the activity but that stills demands for enhancements and afterthoughts.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThat’s why we are proposing to open the moderation role and transition this vital position to the most apt and willing in order to renew energies and bring fresh air and ideas. To this end we propose to create a new moderation team focused on managing the Code of Ethics application within our DAO ecosystem.\n\nAfter the Facilitation Squad grant is over the appropriate onboarding to the selected team will be done. This will include granting required permissions, status and walkthrough tools and processes. Once the knowledge sharing is concluded, the new team will be fully operative in its functions.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nDecentraland DAO Community + Stakeholders: Need for effective moderation that balance the needs of the community while upholding the principles of decentralization, user empowerment, and inclusivity.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\n*   Plurality: Opening the role to the community gives the chance for new perspectives to arise and secure a free-speech environment within the voted guidelines.\n*   Avoid stalling: Allowing new initiatives and enhancements to come from a new team with a fresh start.\n*   Timing: The community has grown and learned over this time, gaining some shared coexistence principles that have led us to this point.\n*   Transition: The new moderation team will start in its functions by the time the Facilitation Squad ends its grant, allowing a smooth transition and ensuring independence.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "[IMPLEMENTATION] Freeze All non-Platform Grant Spending",
    "body": "> by 0x5b5cc427c1d81db4f94de4d51d85ce122d63e244 (Fehz)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Freeze All non-Platform Grant Spending](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f89c4380-6727-11ee-badc-c701988a02c8)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal will work as a complementary document to help outline the specification and implementation pathways for the recently approved “Freeze All non-Platform Grant Spending\".\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines a clear pathway towards the implementation of the proposal aforementioned, specifying its timing, better defining the definition of Facilitation squads, and budget percentage allocation.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe approval of the [“Freeze All non-Platform Grant Spending”](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=a89f79f1-7171-4982-8ca1-5a21b5872373) binding proposal has been an urgent measure, driven by community sentiment following multiple submissions and resubmissions of previously revoked and rejected proposals.\n\nFurthermore, the primary objective of this proposal was to enact a freeze on grant spending for anything other than platform grants, to enhance and prioritize the technical capabilities of the Decentraland ecosystem throughout  2024 or until a proposal to reverse this decision is approved. The rationale behind this policy is that this is an intent to streamline focus, hoping to eliminate distractions and stress within the DAO, and allowing the prioritization of platform development.\n\nThe proposal functioned as a means to establish a policy and, although the proposal's spirit was distinctly articulated and garnered substantial community support, some gray areas needed to be clarified before implementing the changes. Consequently, the author and other community members recognized the necessity for an additional complementary proposal to outline these specifications.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n*   Freeze Grant requests for all categories, except Platform and Core Units.\n*   No new Core Units will be deployed. Only Governance Squad, Grant Support Squad, and Facilitation Squad will be eligible to apply in those categories for the remainder of 2024.\n*   Reduce the Core Unit budget to a maximum of 10% from its current 15% allocation of the quarterly budget.\n*   Leave the Platform budget at 50%, as was [just passed](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=e0fd0b17-a304-4c57-8897-4a830280d74c).\n*   The remaining 40% would go towards the DAO treasury and will not be considered part of the Grants Program budget allocation. Therefore, it won’t be considered an unspent budget when it comes to other proposals looking to use unspent grant money for different purposes. (i.e. [Treasury Diversification](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=060ede06-a9bf-40a2-ab3e-ce8dd53bf759)).\n\n\n## Impacts\n\n*   The outlining and definition of the implementation pathway for the Grants Freeze recently approved will allow more predictability and transparency. It will also set the expectations of all community members regarding the Grants Program till this measure is replaced or revoked.\n*   By reducing the allocated budget for Grants we will be able to save money from the DAO treasury.\n*   By focusing our spending on Platform-related grants we will empower builders in the Decentraland ecosystem to keep creating the technical foundations of the DCL infrastructure and tooling.\n*   By maintaining but reducing the Core Units budget allocation we will ensure the continuity of the DAO operations while optimizing the investment.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n1.  All grant proposals that were created while the binding Governance proposal voting period was open (From Jan 26, 2024, 2:18 AM  UTC to Feb 9, 2024, 2:18 AM UTC), will be considered valid. The approved Grant proposals will be funded.\n2.  All grant proposals that were created after the approval of this binding Governance proposal, would not be considered valid. Therefore, even if the proposal was approved by the community it won’t get funded by the DAO.\n3.  The Governance Squad will suspend the creation of proposals from other categories that are not Platform or Core Units immediately.\n4.  Once the budget allocation for the Core Units category is determined by the approval of this (or another) binding Governance proposal, the Governance Squad will update the quarterly budget allocation for the remaining categories.\n5.  The Grant Support Squad will update the Grants Program Documentation and onboarding following these definitions.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt is in the best interest of the long-term health of the Decentraland ecosystem to look towards building strong foundations. By aiming the Grants Program on platform improvements,  we will hopefully be able to invest and solve the technical issues we’re currently facing, to enable a better experience and lower the barriers of entry to our decentralized virtual world.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (coalition)\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis proposal suggests the introduction of a customizable text box to serve as the biography (BIO) section in Decentraland DAO members' [profiles](https://decentraland.org/governance/profile/?address=0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418) allowing the community to include custom text information, personalizing their presence within the DAO.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe proposed Bio section is seen as a space where members can share a wide range of information. This could include professional links, personal statements, or other relevant content that members wish to showcase, thereby deepening community connections within Decentraland and allowing members to share more about themselves, their interests, views, and networks.\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nThe current DAO profile page doesn’t provide the ability for members to provide any text info.  This feature can facilitate networking, collaboration, and a deeper understanding of the diverse backgrounds within the DAO.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nCustomisable text box with a character limit in the biography (BIO) section of Decentraland DAO member’s profiles that should adhere to community guidelines(COE).\n\n**The text box use cases:**\n\n*   Add links to other platforms(fb,ln).\n\n*   Write brief introductions/info that reflect their personalities or DAO visions.\n\n*   Share information about ongoing projects or seek collaborative opportunities.\n\n*   Ability to include any text, links, or information community members deem relevant.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n*   Governance: Describing personal visions for the future of Decentraland and DAO and how they wish to contribute.\n\n*   Networking: Sharing links to portfolios showcasing their work or projects.\n\n*   Collaboration: Linking to social media accounts to connect with members on different platforms.\n\n*   Branding: Writing a personal statement or bio that highlights individual interests, skills, or experiences within the DAO, virtual worlds or blockchain space.\n\n*   Promotion: Sharing information about ongoing projects or initiatives within Decentraland, seeking collaborators/support.\n\n*   Educational Content: Linking to blogs, articles, or educational resources authored by the  members or deemed valuable for the community.\n\n**Key implementation steps:**\n\n*   UI/UX: Incorporating the text box into an existing profile.\n\n*   Frontend:  Asynchronous data send/retrieve.\n\n*   Backend: Storage of the text content.\n\n*   Moderation Tools: Mechanisms for monitoring and moderating the content to adhere to DAO guidelines(COE).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe introduction of a customizable text box in DAO member profiles can be a step towards advancing personalization and community engagement in Decentraland and DAO. This feature aligns with the DAO's values of openness and collaboration,allowing members to express themselves more fully and build more meaningful connections.\n\nVOTING OPTIONS\n\nYES: Add a Bio section.\n\nNO: Leave as it is.\n\n- YES\n- NO\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Meanwhile the Code of Ethics don't apply to anyone calling me a troll without any evidence to prove such. The Moderator just FEELZ that way. No evidence that my grants were anything less than serious.\n\nI don't appreciate my grants being deleted. I don't appreciate the prohibition of commentary on certain proposals. This commentary is being denied from the whole community, not just me because I am banned. The community cannot post their comments on one of my proposals due to some backdoor decisions without a DAO vote.\n\nIt is looking more and more like there are owners of this Decentraland entity and it's the people who are making decisions without shareholder's consent. Are they the true owners and operators of this Decentraland Organization? If they have the authority to delete grants and authority to prohibit all from being able to comment on the proposals they don't like, is it truly decentralized? This organization clearly has people operating this behind the scenes which would make this not a true DAO.\n\nMy grant that was deleted was about a grant generator that would help people make better grants for Decentraland. This was a serious grant. I am not sure how this is any less serious than 600 NFT posters in Decentraland. So if they consider my serious grants as troll grants, but why are the other grants they favor, not considered troll grants? Why weren't their grants deleted?\n\nAlso a governance proposal which was serious, but would revoke someone's grant that they favor (who also admitted to bribery). They decided behind close doors to delete the ability to comment on that particular proposal. I am not sure what they are worried about, because I have NO ability to comment on the forums or in their discords. So there is no means of communication from me except elsewhere outside their platform. They are actually preventing all DAO members from the ability to communicate with others.\n\nThis proposal aims to make the decisions relating to grants and proposals to be untampered with without permission of the DAO. A \"Yes, Stop interfering without DAO Vote\" would STOP the backdoor decision making that would prohibit commentary by all non-banned people to comment on governance or grant proposals. It would also prevent the deletion of non-malicious governance or grant proposals without expressed permission from a DAO vote.\n\nIf you vote \"No, Let the interfere without DAO Vote\" then they would have the ability to continue what they are doing behind close doors without a DAO decision.\n\n***\n\n**Non-Malicious governance or grant proposals** means any grant proposal that does NOT try to hack platform, steal funds from DAO voters via wallet hacks, or lacks technical security issues.\n\n- Yes, Stop interfering without DAO Vote\n- No, Let the interfere without DAO Vote\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Let's just stick with what works and keep it simple.\n\nRun it like would be optimal as a business. Customer money spent = GP grant power and VP= Voting power. You spend $10,000 in wearable submission fees or MANA or land you get 10,000 VP and GP. But if you vote  on a grant with your 10,000 GP it goes away since that value went to the grant. If the grant passes. If it does not you get your GP back since it was not invested. The value of your GP will be equal to the funds that are put into the DAO  based on whatever transaction. Royalties from Land Purchases, MANA, Wearable Submission fees etc etc any method that puts funds back into the DAO.\n\nCustomers always right. Run it like a company.

    "body": "> by 0x2faab28f398c330430157893a48edc3799d99159 (LandLordDao)\n\nProposal Background:\n\nDecentraland (DCL), as a leading decentralized virtual world, has been committed to promoting community involvement and project innovation. Through the DCL Grant program, many developers and creators have been able to realize their dreams, bringing more value and diversity to the Decentraland community. However, to further enhance project sustainability and applicants' long-term commitment to the Decentraland ecosystem, we propose a new initiative: requiring all DCL Grant applicants to hold at least 5% of the funding amount as long-term investment during the sponsorship period.\n\nProposal Objectives:\n\nEnhance applicants' commitment to project success.\nPromote responsible use of funds, ensuring that sponsored projects can continue to develop.\nStrengthen the connection between applicants and the Decentraland community, encouraging more long-term investment.\nFurther enhance the stability of MANA and LAND assets by increasing the hodling behavior in Decentraland.\n\nProposal Details:\n\nHolding Requirement: All DCL Grant applicants must agree to HODL at least 5% of the funding amount during the sponsorship period. This means that if a project receives a grant of $100,000, they would need to hold at least $5,000 worth of sponsored MANA or LAND assets as a long-term 3years investment.\n\nImplementation: Applicants will need to declare their willingness to comply with this requirement in the application form and provide a transparent mechanism to prove their holding status of MANA or LAND assets. This can be achieved through smart contracts or other blockchain technologies to ensure transparency and verifiability.\n\nOversight and Enforcement: The Decentraland DAO  GSS will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of this policy and conducting regular checks on holding status. Failure to comply with the holding requirement may result in the revocation of sponsorship or other penalties.\n\nExpected Impact: Through the implementation of this proposal, we expect to encourage more project applicants to have a longer-term consideration for the Decentraland ecosystem, while also bringing more stable and high-quality projects to the community.\n\nConclusion:\nThe initiative for DCL Grant applicants to HODL at least 5% of the funding amount is a proposal aimed at promoting project sustainability, enhancing community commitment, and stabilizing the economic ecosystem. Through this policy, we can ensure not only the effective use of funds but also encourage applicants to establish closer ties with the Decentraland community, jointly driving the prosperity and innovation of the ecosystem. We invite all community members to support this proposal and work together to build a more open, inclusive, and innovative Decentraland.\n\n- YES\n- N....O\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Developer advocates we could say.\n\nGaming is key to retain users and the DAO can take action and own products to solve the decline of user traffic in the last 3 months: https://dcl-metrics.com/\n\nWith this proposal also we can make a more efficient use of funds\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nTest for 3 months the creation of a new figure \"Platform unit\".\n\nThese will be the tasks and goals for these people:\n\n*   **Main task: Enhance and expand gamification with proper tooling and gaming frameworks or products**\n*   Increase Synergy between projects\n*   Create bidding and tendering proposals Gamification oriented\n*   Row together in a common direction\n*   To provide support to different projects\n*   Attract more creators: e.g. Promote the platform doing IRL workshops\n*   Evaluation of granted projects\n*   Evaluation of grant proposals\n*   Participation and contribution to the DAO from a technical perspective\n\nIndividual candidates can present a proposal with following requirements and specs:\n\n*   Proven curriculum demonstrating experience and technical skillset, if the candidate want to preserve privacy, GSS can check and express the veracity of the information.\n*   With working hours from 20h per week minimum.\n*   Transparency will be necessary, workflow can be adapted from other core units like the GovernanceApp squad.\n*   Budget can include variable entries, where extra budget will be returned to the DAO, e.g.: hiring other devs and modelers, server and infrastructure, events, workshops, travels.\n\nAt end, 3 candidate proposals will be selected to represent the role.\nOnce selected and work started, some metrics can be:\n\n*   Weekly worklogs\n*   Development of products and tooling in progress\n*   Support hours\n*   IRL Events / workshops\n*   Reports\n*   Created bidding & tendering proposals\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nDecentraland builders, developers and new users to come.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nGamification is key to attract and retain users if driven the proper way.\nWe have an importante decline on user traffic metrics (https://dcl-metrics.com/).\nAlso it's stated that the DAO needs a change due to drain of funds and low value of $MANA.\n\nWe have been funding several projects. However, although we have some collabs between them especially with wearables, there is not much integration.\n\nMoreover for example, several games developed a mining mechanic, and separatedly we dedicated funds for the same feature on different projects.\n\nAlso there is lack of a kind Developer Advocate figure, for the DAO as well for Decentraland Foundation.\n\nApart from this, it's cheaper for the DAO having units than buying products to businesses.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Dixon)\nMetamine (MetaDoge)\nKnights of Antrom (Matt)\nFoundation (Wacaine)\nMusic festivals, etc. (Nico Earnshaw)\nMaybe some more that I cannot remember but I can do this task more from now on.\n\n### Attract more creators\n\nAligned with the ambassador role, I’m so motivated to visit different GameDev education centers and do workshops, by bringing creators that can exponentially bring more communities.\n\n### Evaluate and analyze finished grants\n\nI can work on analyzing funded projects, create objective reports that can contribute to learning how to be more efficient when choosing which projects to fund.\n\n### Participation and contribution to the DAO from a technical perspective\n\nAs a DAO citizen, with technical knowledge and economically covered, I can be more involved on my spare time. I already do but to bring good improvements it requires effort on details instead of just a quick daily forum review\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n*   **Mainly to serve to the DAO**\n*   Weekly worklog: To provide transparency of the realized work.\n\nThere will be some flexible and variable tasks to better adapt the needs depending the moment and requirements:\n\n*   Gamified captcha service: to ease playability while ensuring security.\n*   Support for other mid-junior devs.\n*   Create a “Game Dev Alliance” discord server, I already created one months ago really, or consider creating a new section on DAO discord.\n*   Analyse common needs between projects in order to implement global systems instead of replicating, and paying funds repeatedly to develop similar features, like mining.\n\nWhat probably can also deliver:\n\n*   Start a game framework similar to playfab.\n*   Start super-transaction queuer service to bind off-chain and on-chain actions (similar used at GolfCraft)\n*   Grant product report by demand.\n*   In general, what is stated in the Abstract and Description sections.\n*   Support to other teams interested on contributing to the DAO\n\nThe DAO has spent quite $MANA resources funding different games and experiences, the spending of resources can be more efficient with people working as other **platform units**, similar to what we can consider a DAO employee.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

In that time we've gathered enough information and experience to agree on some changes to improve how the revocation process works, the full text of which we will publish in the near future.\n\nOne of those ideas is to shrink the Revocation Committee from 7 total member slots (5 active members and 2 substitutes) to 5 total member slots (3 active members and 2 substitutes).\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe believe that having 7 total member slots is not necessary based on the workload that we have had and the processes we have already put into place. Furthermore, we anticipate that the workload going forward will be lighter than it was in the past months as there is no longer a backlog of cases to decide on.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nInstead of 7 total members for the revocation committee to be considered full, we suggest that 5 total members be considered full.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs we believe that 5 members can handle the workload of the Revocation Committee\ngoing forward, we suggest that this be officially amended.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This show is now one of the longest running DCL livestreams and serves as a valuable marketing resource for both DCL avatars & the platform itself, here are some rough stats:\n\n*   20-30 average concurrent viewers per stream (mostly active on https://kick.com/morph-bot)\n*   10+ unique chatters per stream\n*   Peak viewership of 75-100 concurrent viewers during special events: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HE4sRmL61I\n*   \\~300 lifetime stream hours\n\n### Weekly top-3 event, 2 years running\n\nI founded Diamond Hands Thursdays as a way to livestream Decentraland and foster a community event, after several months of organizing this event I was able to legitimize it via DG where they upgraded it with a verified schedule and music acts/prizes - it continues as the staple of my livestream as I host a table every Thursday and is often found in the Top 3 most active scenes.\n\n![DHC](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F1fXqIIWAAIIJRL?format=jpg\\&name=4096x4096)\n\n### DCL Avatars in the mainstream\n\nMorphBot will be appearing for non-profit in a mainstream triple-A game alongside SpongeBob and other major IP characters thanks to DCL's unique IP system, he is a boss character in the story mode that must be beaten multiple times.\n\n![Spongebob](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GB2CW06bwAAB1m8?format=jpg\\&name=4096x4096)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nAs this grant is retroactive, I hope the milestones and work above speaks for itself. I believe my presence evangelizing DCL in external metaverse groups has had a positive impact on how Decentraland is viewed in the larger metaverse community, as well as propagating our standards and concepts beyond the platform itself.\n\nAs I am a smaller streamer, I have proposed the grant with this in mind and attempted to keep the value to a fair market rate. I do believe I have brought consistent value as mentioned above, and that it has been a successful marketing endeavor, albeit at a smaller scale than many influencer level initiatives.\n\nFinally, I believe having a DCL avatar in a mainstream video game (Over 1,000,000 races during Beta wave 1) will be a significant presence in yet another non-metaverse community, potentially leading to further excitement around DCL's wearables engine and VRM avatars.\n\nWhether this grant is successful or not, I will always continue to stream and attempt to improve Decentraland's avatar system. I hope that I can continue to bring value to this space and others, as it has done much for me as well.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x0d2d5a968127d3fea9dc5032c78724620980a62d (dclchess)\n\nShould the following $18,600 grant in the Social Media Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nDevelop monthly reward program for creators and hire full time marketing expert to support all projects in the DCL ecosystem.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n18,600 USD in MANA\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n4 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x0d2D5a968127d3feA9dc5032c78724620980a62d\n\n## Email address\n\ndclmana777@proton.me\n\n## Description\n\nDCL would significantly benefit if a monthly reward program was setup to give wearables and emotes to creators making valuable contributions to the community. Creating monthly incentives for the continual development of film club, game jam, fashion week, etc would stimulate the community to produce enough marketing content to return the price of MANA to a new all time high. The original poll I created a month ago for this idea can be seen here: https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=19a178a2-40a8-4e89-a948-1f13552dcda1\n\nThe process to do this would be to create new mythic/legendary wearables and emotes 2.0 every month and distribute them as rewards to content creators based on the merits of their work. I would ultimately be managing the program but would look to involve trusted community members as much as possible. To reduce risks of personal bias I would like to create a committee of 10-20+ members to help me make decisions and oversee operations.\n\nPrimary goals:\n\\-Provide dedicated marketing support for all projects in DCL\n\\-Onboard 10-50+ popular social media content creators into DCL (and their followers)\n\\-5-10x current daily active users\n\\-5-10x marketplace publishing and purchasing activity\n\\-5-10x the amount of new games/land development in genesis city and worlds\n\\-5-10x social media activity related to DCL\n\\-Promote DCL's advantages over other platforms, specifically emotes 2.0 and worlds\n\\-Establish a content creator fund for cost effective sustainability of the Create-To-Earn system\n\\-Establishing DCL as the definitive leader of the metaverse trend\n\nThe second part of my proposal is to personally offer my own marketing expertise and experience to all projects in DCL. This would take the form of spending up to a few hours every week (per person) in direct contact with anyone trying to create anything in DCL. I would provide detailed marketing strategies and possibly content creation services for everyone, from the most active scenes to someone launching a wearable or trying to gain more followers for their web2 accounts.\n\nI have a lot of ideas and passion for DCL which I would like to express through a full time DAO sponsorship instead of being hired multiple times as a independent freelancer. The results would be significantly less effective if I charged individual creators for marketing because their limited budgets should instead be spent on improving their products. As a community marketing manager, my role is to support all projects with numerous weekly hours spent on the creation of personalized marketing strategies. As the developer of the Create-To-Earn system, my role is to create monthly rewards for content such as film club, game jam, fashion week, art, architecture, etc. The following list of actions would enter the creator into possibly winning one of the monthly wearables:\n\n\\-Create an engaging high quality video about DCL\n\\-Create a fun and original game in genesis city or worlds\n\\-Publish a wearable or emote to the marketplace\n\\-Create a high quality art/architecture scene in genesis city or worlds\n\\-Contribute to foundation events\n\\-Onboard new social media creators\n\\-Host events in DCL\n\\-Etc... Generally anything that creates significant value for the DCL community\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n1.  Get in contact with everyone who needs marketing support for their DCL related projects\n2.  Establish price agreements with multiple wearable/emote creators for the monthly film club rewards\n3.  Begin to significantly increase all social media content related to DCL\n4.  Generate cost effective marketing strategies for creators in DCL to expand sustainably without DAO support\n5.  Promote the film club to engage the community and onboard as many new creators as possible\n6.  Work with the foundation's marketing team and provide support where needed\n7.  Create inworld events and weekly meetings for the film club's community led management to organize itself\n8.  Enable community members to easily find ways to work together on large marketing projects\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x2bbd17c07e6f178ba6f51e1b526a43125662c248 (Bleace)\n\nShould the following $24,000 grant in the Social Media Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis initiative focuses on producing vertical content that community members can post on their own accounts, featuring the Decentraland logo prominently to enhance brand visibility and recognition. Through an open call I ensure an equitable opportunity for all community members to participate and share their unique perspectives and experiences within Decentraland. This approach not only democratizes content creation but also fosters a sense of ownership and pride among community members.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n24,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2bBd17c07e6F178BA6F51e1B526A43125662c248\n\n## Email address\n\nsupport@bleace.com\n\n## Description\n\nFor those who know me in Decentraland, I am Bleace, but my real name is Ryan Lannom, a multimedia specialist with a rich background in film, video editing, and social media content creation. With a Bachelor's Degree in Multimedia Film and Video from Florida Atlantic University and an extensive career, including five years as an Associate Producer/Video Editor for CBS Sports, my journey has been a continuous effort to improve and grow.\n\nThe power of short-form and live-stream content on social media platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram is undeniable. Yet, a cursory search of #Decentraland on these platforms reveals a concerning trend: an overwhelming presence of negative content that overshadows the innovative and community-driven aspects of the Decentraland experience. This proposal aims to counteract this negative perception by dedicating 40-60 hours weekly to the creation of positive, engaging, and informative short-form content in collaboration with Decentraland community members.\n\nThe core objective of this proposal is twofold: firstly, to significantly increase the volume of positive, brand-aligned content related to Decentraland across major social media platforms, thereby improving the public perception of the Decentraland community. Secondly, to empower community members by providing them with the tools and photo and video content to share their stories and experiences from their own account especially for those who may not have the means to do so, creating a more vibrant, engaged, and positive online community.\n\nThrough extensive content creation within Decentraland, showcased across YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, and Instagram, I have gained invaluable insights into the platform's ecosystem and its audience's desires. My work for Dollhouse in 2023, resulting in nearly 100,000 views on TikTok and YouTube, underscores the potential impact of targeted, high-quality content. Yet, several pressing questions have emerged: Why is Decentraland not more widely recognized? Why are its engagement and event attendance not reflective of its technological advancements? Why doesn’t Decentraland have a Top-10 Music Performance in terms of number of active attendees? When people see my content on TikTok or YouTube why are they guessing it’s Sandbox, Roblox and not Decentraland and not even knowing Decentraland exists? Having the technology expand is great, but that means nothing if no one knows about it or a want to use it.\n\nDrawing from my extensive experience both within and outside Decentraland, I've noticed a significant gap in resources available to many community members. I've been fortunate to invest in state-of-the-art equipment, including a high-performance Alienware PC equipped with an RTX 3090 GPU, 128GB RAM, and a 12th Gen i9 CPU, alongside a 32GB RAM laptop, a Mac Pro desktop, and an iMac. All these are connected to a fiber internet connection in Brooklyn, NYC. This arsenal of technology allows me to present Decentraland in its finest form and explore innovative content-creation methods. With access to advanced software, I'm equipped to bring new perspectives and elevate the community's digital presence.\n\nWebsite: https://www.ryanlannomdesign.com/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/bleace\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nPhase 1\nCalendar Setup: Launch an online booking system for community members to schedule photo shoots, video recordings, and live stream sessions.\nCommunity Outreach: Initiate a campaign to inform and encourage community members to fill the calendar with their events.\nFirst Content Drops: Produce and share the initial batch of content created from scheduled events and collaborations.\nPhase 2\nWeekly Events Launch: Start hosting weekly events in Decentraland, beginning with the Wellness Week build and expanding to other community spaces.\nDJ Bookings: Secure commitments from DJs and performers, both from within and outside the Decentraland community, for upcoming events.\nPhase 3\nContent Amplification: Increase the frequency and variety of content produced, aiming for at least one post per day across multiple platforms.\nCollaboration Deepening: Strengthen ties with community members through featured content projects, highlighting individual talents and stories.\nEvent Variety Enhancement: Introduce new event formats and collaborations to diversify content and engage broader audiences.\nPhase 4\nPerformance Review: Analyze content engagement data, community feedback, and overall project impact to assess the achievement of initial goals.\nFeedback Integration: Incorporate community suggestions and lessons learned into the project’s future direction.\nScaling Strategy: Develop and share a plan for scaling successful aspects of the project, including potential new content formats and partnership opportunities.\nProgress Sharing\nMonthly Updates: Share detailed progress reports with the community via Decentraland’s official channels, social media, and live stream Q\\&A sessions.\nReal-Time Engagement: Utilize Discord and Twitter for ongoing project updates, sneak peeks behind the scenes, and direct community interaction.\nTransparency Portal: Establish an online dashboard where community members can track project milestones, upcoming events, and real-time content production efforts.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Open up discussion for a Metaverse Layer 2 that developed by DCL ",
    "body": "> by 0x05060fa97e54a812d1e15cec6c34e79f74ebd0b3 (MetaDoge)\n\n**Disclaim: This is not a grant proposal and the proposal aims at opening up discussion at this very moment.**\n\nDecentraland is facing serious challenges. In 2020, DCL was the one who led the narrative of both the Web3 & Web2 metaverse and people were incentivized to trade to play and build in DCL. However, we can see a declining trend with fewer users, and developers and shrinking market capitalization.\n\nFor the competition layout, In Web2, we have metaverses like Roblox or Fortnite that have excellent user experience (since they are huge teams and have years of experience..) In Web3, new metaverses emerging like Nifty Island on ETH or Bitmap on Ordinals have a strong economic hook to Web 3 users, and they all have posed huge threats to DCL.\n\nMy worry here is If we only follow the traditional route of product development, and before we have a \"good\" platform, the market cap of DCL will be squeezed by its competitors, and that will consequently affect the price of MANA as well as the budget of both foundation and DAO. If that happens, it is logical to believe that the development speed will be slower and slower due to the shrinking budget and put us in a weak position on the market (imagine the foundation cut more people and the DAO can fund fewer and fewer projects.)\n\nThus at the very moment, we might need to think of some measures, and this brings us to the topic of \\*\\* A potential Ethereum Layer 2 that focuses on Metaverse, developed by DCL Foundation and the DAO. And it could potentially become the infrastructure of more projects like Decentraland. \\*\\*\n\n**Why a Layer 2?**\n\n1/ New Story\n\nIt provides a new narrative for Decentraland that fits the trend of launching Layer 2. Which can easily cause more attention from the public. ( Last cycle our Metaverse story was pretty effective and successful)\n\n2/ New Tokens as incentives to attract contributors and players.\n\nBy launching a Metaverse Layer 2, we can have a new token (think about ARB, OP or Blast), and **use part of the token as an incentive for people to play and develop in both Decentraland and this Layer 2 as a whole.** I have thought about directly using MANA as the incentive, but the truth is that we don't have enough MANA in the DAO to use,  using a new token means it can be more sustainable. Plus, a new layer2 token can trigger more expectations from the users.\n\n3/ Sensibility\n\nFor so long, we have relied on Polygon as the side chain for wearable trading, so if we have a chance, why we do not use a layer 2 chain developed by us? And if more metaverse projects are developed on this new layer 2 chain, \\*\\*Decentraland will truly become the infrastructure of web3 metaverse, as we will have a layer 2 chain for transactions, and we have open-source reference clients. \\*\\*\n\n**Is this feasible?**\n\nYes, I believe with the help of the Foundation and the DAO, this will be feasible. The foundation got direct resources from key investors like Grey Scale, DCG etc which could be potential backers of the scheme. Both the foundation and  DAO have gathered a bunch of top talents who know about Web3 and Metaverse. Good backers plus a good team will form a good foundation for this layer 2.\n\n**Risk?**\n\nThe risk here also lies on the application side as there are full challenges along the way with a lot of uncertainties, both technical and operational. However, with the resources that DCL and DAO accumulated for years, it already has a better chance than others.\n\n**Last, I want to emphasise that layer 2 should not affect the current efforts on platform enhancement by the foundation and the DAO, ideally, they should be working in parallel.** And if we could raise more funds, and with more people, this would be possible.\n\nI do not want to get into too many details as this proposal is here to gather community consensus, for now, the only ones who care about DCL are the DAO and the community, any decisions should be pushed by all of us to make it happen. If there are people who are interested in this idea, we can create a channel on Discord for further discussion and invite some people from the foundation to join as well.\n\n- Ye, Create a dedicted channle in DAO discord for this topic\n- No, it's not a priority now\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Add GBM Auctions dApp as a stand-alone Decentraland auction house",
    "body": "> by 0x89a1d730aa1e78a0ede8dea988acecff0a6e99a9 (Szjanko)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Integration of GBM Auctions in Decentraland’s Marketplace](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f948fa30-6575-41c1-a2e5-57be5fc8ce4e)\n\n## Summary\n\nAdd in the GBM Auctions dApp as a stand-alone auction house for the Decentraland marketplace, where users can utilize Bid-to-Earn auctions to list and purchase their assets while earning $MANA whenever they are outbid.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Decentraland marketplace currently does not offer any type of auctioning. Auctions are a great price discovery tool for rarer items, ensuring sellers get the best market price. GBM Auctions is an incentivized auction mechanism where bidders make money when they are outbid- it’s a battle-tested product with over 70,000 auctions completed and over $200m in bidding volume. We believe the outcome of adding GBM will mean more activity on the marketplace, both in terms of listing items and people bidding and also better sales prices – all while members get a more rewarding experience earning $MANA.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, users can only sell for a fixed price using the Decentraland marketplace. This is not ideal, especially for rarer, more hard-to-value items- as it is difficult to come up with a starting price. Members either end up overpricing and not getting any traction, or under-pricing and leaving money on the table. This, we believe, has led to a slump in activity and listings- especially during the bear market where many users chose to sit on their assets instead of take to the market for fear of inadequate interest.\nA price discovery system like an auction fixes this, allowing the market to dictate the price. We propose utilizing GBM Auctions which is a gamified version for web3 assets specifically where bidders make money when they are outbid- introducing not only auctions into Decentraland but a Bid-to-Earn component too.\nThe incentivization rockets activity as bidders are now incentivized to participate. It’s proven to generate more traffic and much higher sale prices- GBM’s existing partners have seen a 200% increase in sales price. For the bidders it also makes the experience more rewarding where they either win the item or earn $MANA.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe specifically propose to use GBM Auction’s dApp as a stand-alone auction house, so users can have another option. They can still sell via fixed price through the existing marketplace but now they also have a choice to use the separate auction house.\nThe dApp has the Bid-to-Earn bidding mechanism back end but also a front template which can be branded with Decentralands colors and logo to make it a more seamless experience. The fact that the front end is done already means the dApp is light effort to deploy and will only need a day or two of dev work. It can also be hosted as a subdomain, something like auctions.decentraland.org.\nIncentives are paid out in $MANA (or whichever currency the auction is listed in) and happen in real time. Ultimately the incentives come out of the final sales price so there is a degree of control a seller can have in deciding what is the maximum incentive they are willing to give. The whole mechanism is completely self sustainable and requires no new liquidity to be added in.\nYou can see a full video demo specifically for Decentraland here\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/17a10b9f893045c78eec311ff442e8b9?sid=584be386-dd72-4198-9749-3e544fb36b71\n\nThere is no upfront investment required. No fixed costs or monthly running fees, unless you would like GBM to set up and host everything, in which case there is monthly fee of around $1000, but if the foundation can do this themselves there is no cost. GBM charges a 2% fee only on sales made through GBM auctions. Fixed-price sales and other non-GBM transaction methods are exempt from this fee. Full project management support is also included.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe believe adding in the GBM Auction house dApp will make for a great addition to the existing marketplace, firstly by adding in an auction mechanism as well as a Bid-to-Earn gamified experience. This should have a big impact on activity, both on buying and selling and this has been proven from their existing clients and case studies already.\nGBM has completed over 70,000 auctions and is working with The Sandbox, Rarible, Unstoppable Domains and Aavegotchi just to name a few. The founders are fully doxxed and have been working in the blockchain space since 2018, whilst being involved as early as 2013.\n\nHugo McDonaugh, CEO, DCL Username ‘ObiWanKenobi’ - https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugomcdonaugh/\n\nEdouard Bessire, COO\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/edouardbessire/\n\nGuillaume Gonnaud, CTO\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaume-gonnaud/\n\nThere is no cost to implement, they are happy to support in integration and it does not over ride or force people to choose only this method, so we can not see any down side.\n\nThe first stage poll for this proposal also had a high level of engagement and backing from the community with close to 8.5m VP votes pushing for some sort of GBM integration and zero votes opting for leaving this out. With this level of enthusiasm we do believe the dApp will be used by the community and be a value add to the whole Decentraland ecosystem by increasing volumes and floor prices.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

A User clicks an object or image in-game.\n2.  Which loads the games lobby.\n3.  Choose your game and choose single/multiplayer.\n\n*   Single player can add bots to play against.\n*   Multiplayer will load the active tables where the user can spectate or join.\n\n4.  Play game\n\n### Who?\n\nI built the SNAP game.\n\n*   **GITHUB:** [SNAP on GitHub](https://github.com/ERC20s/UNO/tree/main/src/uno)\n*   **DCL:** [Play in Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/play/?position=13%2C-1)\n\nIt may seem like a simple game but it actually took a lot of time to build.\nPutting one card on top of the other, seems like a simple task. XD.\nBut when you include:\n\n*   Card designs\n*   In-game UI\n*   Game mechanics\n*   WSS messaging to the server\n*   Sorting of data on the server\n*   Server-side game rules\n*   Multiplayer activity\n*   Adding/removing bots\n*   And more...\n\nIt became quite complex but I learnt a lot from this experience.\nUnfortunately SNAP was built heavily in SDK6 and now **SDK7** has a react based UI system so SNAP will need to be completely rebuilt from scratch.\n**So let's rebuild better!**\n\n### Things I Learnt from SNAP:\n\n1.  Most of the logic, cards and players can be easily applied to different card games.\n    So this time I want to build with multiple game choices in mind to easily add more in the future **\\[POKER] \\[CHEAT] \\[CUSTOM] \\[RUMMY] \\[SNAP] \\[WAR]**.\n2.  **Cards is more fun with more players!** So this time I will focus on synchronising games across different LANDs. Making sure that if one build changes their UI/code then it won't affect the others.\n3.  LAND owners don't really want to run their own server and pay $12 a month. So I want to make sure the wss endpoints are bulletproof and anyone can connect!\n4.  **Storage.** I will try to minimize in-game storage. It shouldn't take more than a few MB to add to your existing build.\n5.  **Who's missing?** This time we need **hosts** that can create and control when a game starts! To make sure that everyone is in the game!\n6.  **Competition is good.** Sometimes more than 8 people wanted to play at the same time. So now we will split the users onto different tables and create a multi-table tournament. This could allow for large competitions of 1,000+ participants and allow for **big prizes**!\n7.  **Points?** Some card games are points based, we'll add that. But I want to stress that we are not building a gambling platform!\n8.  **Leaderboard.** Because why not..\n9.  **Statistics.** To show how popular we are!\n\n### How to Deploy?\n\nLAND owners can deploy a build to their LAND by:\n\n*   Uploading a template via [Decentraland Builder Pools](https://decentraland.org/builder/pools). \\[Good for non coders]\n*   Cloning from GitHub and customizing. \\[Good for coders]\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### What games will I build first?\n\n**First game I want to build is a kind of property game based around decentraland.** Where you need to collect MANA cards and LAND cards but there are a bunch of action cards to make life difficult like\n\n*   \"You win a hackathon! Take a LAND card from any opponent\"\n*   \"You didn't back up your private key!? You lose 10 MANA.\"\n*   \"Great event! Everyone buys your NFT for 5 MANA!\".\n*   Players can charge their opponents for rent and the winner is the person who reaches 100 LAND first.\n*   Been dreaming of this for a while.. haha\n*   \\[**A complicated game with lots of rules will be a good basis to test the system.**]\n\n**Then I'll add SNAP again.**\n\nI will add as many games as possible until the money runs out.\nIf you want to see a specific card game then let me know.\n(I believe this will become a successful part of the DCL brand and could potentially be added to the UI globally)\n\n*   **\\[Month 1-3]:**\n    Build the server-side infrastructure that can handle everything\n*   **\\[Month 3-5]:**\n    Build the interface in decentraland.\n*   **\\[Month 5-6]:**\n    Deploy to (13, -1)/Test/Opensource\n*   **\\[Month 6-8]:**\n    Add more games!\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should the DAO create a Grant Program Pricing Guide?",
    "body": "> by 0x153b2252eddcb3690ae6f5e9f38be13779e1364d (REDACTED)\n\nA common issue with grant budgets is the wide disparity in costs of common elements. From server costs to wearable creation, it isn't uncommon for the prices of identical services to be vastly different. Over the remainder of 2024, we will focus on creating a Pricing Guide that sets clear expectations for what the DAO is willing to spend. Working with creators and developers familiar with Decentraland, we will establish a benchmark for what is a reasonable amount of money to spend on a wide range of the most common and fundamental items found in Grant Program budgets.\n\nBy creating this price guide, the Grant Support Squad, Revocation Committee, or whatever team in the future is responsible for holding grants accountable will have a tangible and already agreed-upon list of costs teams are expected to be spending on services.\n\nThis will reduce the padding of budgets that many feel is all to common, and also remove the need for the community to police these costs in the forums when projects submit budgets.\n\nIt is all too common that you will see someone with a line item for \"Server Costs\" or \"wearable creation\" that those in the community intimately familiar with those processes question, \"Why do you have $5,000 for server costs?\" or \"How many wearables will you be creating for $10,000?\"\n\nIf you are going to come to the DAO for money to create your game, or finance your Music event, you will need to know exactly how many wearables you intend to create, how many hours of video you plan on streaming, and only then will you be allowed, VP threshold met or not, to proceed with your grant.\n\nThe creation of this Pricing Guide will not be done in a silo, and while the Facilitation squad, GSS, or I may drive the process behind getting it done, it will be the people in the community who create wearable, host servers and are intimately familiar with building in Decentraland that will tell us what things should cost.\n\nAs with everything in the DAO, this pricing guide, once created, will have to be voted on by the community. Though server cost and wearable creation are the examples given, this Pricing Guide will include a thorough breakdown based on all previous budgets and community feedback on items that should be included, like hourly rates for different types of work and travel expenses.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

I can't help but notice how much more similar DCL was when Laser Tag Everywhere was being distributed for free.  Remember my grant had possibility of making teams version even!?  Did you notice this?  Is Nifty island basically the same if my Laser Tag would have been funded and expanded full time?  IMO yes 100%\n\nPut in the comments do you think the ideas were stolen from my grants possibly funneled to devs by those same legislators saying no in DCL?  Is DCL being intentionally destroyed and attacked?  Do you think those \"big shot\" No voters on my grants are also on the development teams and investment boards of Nifty Island?  Notice how they hype it!  Or do you think these VP work for the communist state-entities of USA such as Walmart & TaylorSwift and they are here to make sure capitalism cannot be created by deleting all business opportunities for the poors just like in real life?  I think both probably IMO.  No doubt with that kind of VP they have access to ask Jerome Powell to print another million of communism-dollars.\n\nI have been watching some game play of Nifty, DCL can do most of this very few features are missing for example - 1 - camera shake / earthquake / rumble / spin  2 - NLA mixing of emotes in DCL if walking can't trigger gun fire emote / can only trigger when inactive.  Gun fire / Player Hit / Player Dies need added into the actual pre-built emotes like walk jump so they can mix correctly in combination for instance walk-shoot,\n\n- Yes I noticed this because I'm smart\n- No, I am not very observant\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xc375b0a133f49dbf3c6418895d6d024be2d8f84a (noh0mie)\n\nShould the following $16,000 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWith tax filing season beginning in the US, I want to create a tool for the Decentraland community for helping with tax tracking of Wearables transactions. While there are services like Koinly or CoinTracker for helping with NFT tax tracking, it would be better to have an open source tool for determining the cost basis and tax exposure specifically for any Decentraland wearable transactions.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n16,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xc375b0A133F49DbF3C6418895d6d024BE2D8F84a\n\n## Email address\n\nwyattlovesgrapes@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nTracking your cost basis of Mana and sales of wearables right now is annoying, I want to make that way easier.\n\n**Key Benefits**\n\nHaving a community tool for Wearables tax tracking would have the following benefits:\n\n1.  **Easy Wearables Transaction Tracking** - Will scrape data from your wallet to specifically track Mana and Wearables transactions. Will have a Google Sheets and Apps Script interface in the Alpha release and become a simple a webapp in the final product\n2.  **Free To The End User & Open Source** - Koinly or CoinTracker would require you to have a premium subscription to handle the average transaction volume a user sees buying wearables in a year, which is lame. Some users like myself prefer to file taxes without this added third party cost or track manually.\n3.  **Will Output CSV** - Compatible with major tax software like Turbo Tax or FreeTaxUSA for filing form 8949 or other requested filing formats for other countries. Will work with multiple countries base currencies for determining tax basis.\n\n**Potential Bonus Features**\n\n1.  Tracking other currencies - Additional tracking for relevant tokens like Matic, Eth, etc\n2.  Additional exchanges for historical prices sources - Tiingo supports like 40+ exchanges so you can accurately calculate your cost basis on the day of a sale. To start I'll use major ones like Coinbase(GDAX), Kraken, Binance but will add more on request or just because!\n3.  Track NFT sales on other chains - Track Eth NFTs or Solana\n4.  Track other stuff - Alerts for malicious nfts/token air drops, what do you own the most of(wearble, top creator, etc)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Plan Outline**\n\nWith tax season quickly approaching I will be completing the majority of development in sprints throughout the month of February, targeting a working Alpha release which can be shared with initial users.\n\n1.  Jan 29 - Feb 7 | Develop a functional prototype in Google Sheets:\n\n*   Currently I have connected in Apps Script to the PolygonScan Api to pull ERC-721 and ERC-20 Tx info from my wallet and to the Tiingo Api to get historical data to cross reference the cost of mana against. I am able to see corresponding transactions in the console based on the Tx hash of Mana going in/out during a wearable transfer.\n\n*   The next step is to cross reference this data based on the Tx Hash to determine how much Mana was spent during each Tx or categorize the Tx as needing more information such as in the case of a transfer in or out to ones self or someone else. I will sort the transactions into separate categorized sheets and begin to calculate account overview data based on the wallet address\n\n*   The final step of the prototype will be to move variables being assigned within Apps Script into cells of Google Sheets so the end user can easily pass data through like their wallet addresses or timeframes.\n\n2.  Feb 7 - 21 | Develop a UI prototype in Google Sheets:\n\n*   Take all that data and make it pretty, also probably add/sort some more data because I'm sure I'll think of some things along the way.\n*   Add sheets in correct format for popular tax software for CSV output.\n*   Develop a Alpha deploy plan where users can duplicate a master Google Sheet and track their wearable transactions.\n\n3.  Feb 21 - 28 | Test and Deploy\n\n*   Stress test everything and deploy the Alpha release by Feb 28 with 48 days till tax day.\n\n4.  Feb 28 - April 30 | Troubleshoot, Update, Migrate\n\n*   Migrate to a js based web app front end (thinking FlutterFlow as its easy and can be self deployed)\n*   Provide ongoing support for Alpha users, fix bugs and issues in sheets version\n*   Add bonus features\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x153b2252eddcb3690ae6f5e9f38be13779e1364d (REDACTED)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should all code generated using DAO funds be open source?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e82e640a-aa4a-4353-8183-63339e76cfd0)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe governance proposal outlines the specifics of making open-sourcing a prerequisite for grant approval and designating the Decentraland DAO public GitHub repository for code storage.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal advocates for a significant shift in the approach of this DAO for its Grants Program by requiring that all projects funded through DAO resources make their code open source.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDecentraland DAO Grants Program has already allocated $13,272,124.00 to different projects since its creation. As of the beginning of 2023 (https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=77475620-7b74-11ed-ad27-015f26e7c35c) open-sourcing the code was made a requirement for the **Platform** category. Prior to 2023 and up till today, across all other categories, only a limited number of projects were open source and/or accessible to the community, with some of them even quitting and not creating value for the environment.\n\nTo avoid that happening, it has become evident that there is a clear need to mandate that all grant recipients publish their project code in a manner that is accessible to every creator seeking to build, advance, and enhance their projects and the platform as a whole. The barriers to entry are already too high for new creators; open-sourcing and maintaining a public repository will help to make it easier for new creators to be onboarded and for existing projects to enhance their performance and content.\n\nAll code produced with DAO funds should start being considered in terms of ‘public goods’ from now on, promoting the idea of collaboration and the ethos of decentralization of the project, fostering the modular growth of the ecosystem.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n*   From the date of approval of this governance proposal, all projects seeking funds from the DAO must commit to open-sourcing their code as a mandatory condition.\n\n*   All code generated using DAO funds must be hosted in the Decentraland DAO public GitHub repository (https://github.com/decentraland-dao), which will be overseen by the Grant Support Squad.\n\n*   Failure to open source code or maintain the GitHub repository up-to-date may result in an immediate pause and potential revocation of a grant.\n\n*   GitHub repository set up as part of the onboarding process.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal marks a significant step towards transparency, collaboration, and value-driven development within the DAO Grants program. Open-sourcing of code will promote a more accessible and inclusive environment for creators while embracing the ethos of decentralization.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Providing simple, non-technical error explanations and possible troubleshooting steps can improve user satisfaction and retention.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPotential error messages will be rewritten in everyday language and each message will be accompanied by a set of recommended actions that users can take to resolve the problem. In the event that, due to complexity, it is not feasible to assign a precise description to each error message, a generic reason will be shown. This message should also appear alongside tips for possible solutions, such as checking your computer's time synchronization, ensuring VPNs are not in use, and other relevant steps.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nAnticipated impacts include reduced frustration among users when these incidents occur and possible resolution of the problem by the user.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nImplementation will involve the development team rewriting error messages and creating a list of tips or comprehensive troubleshooting guide that will be included in the same place where the error appears or alternatively in the Decentraland documentation.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy implementing user-friendly error messages, we can reduce user frustration and discontent, improve the overall experience, and potentially decrease the volume of support requests on the Discord server.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x5b5cc427c1d81db4f94de4d51d85ce122d63e244 (Fehz)\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to transition the  moderation role within these two options: 1) DAO Committee or 2) Moderation team hired through bidding and tendering. The objective is to renew this essential role and open a new chapter based on our frameworks and learnings.\n\nAs we previously stated, Facilitation Squad will continue to be committed and manage moderation during the grant period, but will also lead and coordinate a process for appointing a new moderation team based on community consultation in the short term.\n\nLooking towards to evolve into a more cohesive and active community we believe it’s time to re-think some of the key roles within the DAO while keeping a welcoming and safe environment that brings the best out of all members. In that spirit, we are proposing a new strategy for moderation.\n\nOver the past year, many efforts have been done towards this end, being the Code of Ethics our most tangible outcome. The CoE sets the bar for how we want to address our disputes and the minimum level of respect required to jump into any debate. This is not capricious, it’s a statement of core principles that we stand for and that require monitoring and gatekeeping.\n\nThat’s why we are proposing to open the moderation role and transition this vital position to the most apt and willing in order to renew energies and bring fresh air and ideas. We are confident in saying that we are down the right path and hoping that the feeling of a more tolerant environment is shared.\n\n**VOTING OPTIONS**\n\nTo that end we are proposing two options to accomplish this transition:\n\n1.  Creating a Moderation Committee: would include establishing eligibility criteria, framework, compensations and SOW for a 3 people committee elected within a three-staged process: an open call, interviews conducted by the current moderation team, and a final voting using the hiring category.\n\n2.  Bidding and Tendering process for a moderation team: would include open bids for an internal or external moderation team and define a SOW and SLA for operating.\n\n- Moderation Committee\n- Bidding and Tendering Process\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The project leverages VR technology to create inclusive spaces for community connection and exploration, promoting empathy and improving quality of life.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n100,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x3A2cC2A5b269ac124170A64A128F1F92A80f9819\n\n## Email address\n\nriccokoc@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n***\"We're here to discuss and refine the idea, focusing on inclusivity and impact. Your feedback is crucial in shaping the project to better serve its intended audience. As the project evolves, we'll hold a vote to gauge community interest and support. Thank you for your valuable input and engagement.\"***\n\n\"Empathy Vision\" is an innovative initiative aimed at fostering empathy and inclusivity in the virtual world, particularly for individuals with disabilities. The project utilizes non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to support its mission of providing access to virtual experiences for disadvantaged individuals.\n\nThrough \"Empathy Vision,\" anonymous buyers have the opportunity to purchase NFTs representing virtual assets created by the project team. These virtual assets, ranging from digital art to interactive experiences, serve as contributions to the project's goal of creating a more inclusive virtual environment.\n\nA unique aspect of \"Empathy Vision\" is its focus on accessibility. A portion of the proceeds from NFT sales is allocated to the acquisition of MetaVR headsets, which are then distributed to individuals with disabilities. These headsets enable users to access virtual content and interact with the virtual world, thereby enhancing their overall virtual experience.\n\nThe process is simple: buyers acquire NFTs through decentralized marketplaces or platforms, knowing that their purchase contributes to a greater cause. By supporting \"Empathy Vision,\" buyers not only gain ownership of unique digital assets but also help provide access to virtual experiences for disadvantaged individuals.\n\nThrough the combination of NFTs, virtual assets, and accessibility initiatives, \"Empathy Vision\" aims to bridge the gap between virtual and real-world communities, fostering empathy, understanding, and inclusivity for all.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n\"The roadmap of the Empathy Vision project consists of several key steps:Community Building and Awareness: We'll start by building our community and raising awareness about our project. We'll engage with disabled individuals, supporters, and volunteers through communication and outreach efforts.Development and Testing Phase: In the second stage, we'll develop and test the core components of our project. We'll design virtual reality experiences tailored to the needs of disabled individuals and refine them based on user feedback.Accessibility and Usability: The third step involves making our project fully accessible to disabled individuals. We'll optimize user interfaces and experiences to ensure that everyone can fully benefit from our project.Community Engagement and Growth: In the fourth stage, we'll focus on increasing community engagement and growth. We'll organize events to encourage participation from disabled individuals and supporters and conduct outreach efforts to reach wider audiences.Sustainability and Expansion: Lastly, we'll strengthen our project with long-term sustainability and expansion strategies. By solidifying financial resources and forming partnerships, we'll ensure the long-term success of our project and reach even broader audiences.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x2faab28f398c330430157893a48edc3799d99159 (LandLordDao)\n\nShould the problem/opportunity outlined be refined and taken to the next level?\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThis proposal aims to tender a professional team to develop an innovative Ask Me Anything (AMA) feature for Decentraland (DCL). The feature will allow users to interact in real-time within DCL's metaverse environment, ask questions, and receive immediate responses, thereby enhancing community engagement and user experience.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nImplement a user-friendly AMA interface that enables users to easily ask questions and browse answers within the metaverse.\nEnsure real-time and interactive AMA sessions.\nProvide a robust backend management system for organizers to plan, monitor, and manage AMA events.\nEnsure system security to prevent misuse and inappropriate behavior.\nSupport multiple languages to cater to a global user base.\nProject Requirements:\n\nA professional team familiar with Decentraland and blockchain technology.\nExperience in developing similar social interaction platforms.\nCapability to provide comprehensive project management and support.\nDeep understanding of user experience and interface design.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nThe team's professional capabilities and project experience.\nFeasibility and innovation of the project plan.\nReasonableness of the budget and cost-effectiveness.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nWhy the Decentraland DAO Should Invest in the AMA Feature Development\nMarket Conditions and Trends\nGrowing Interest in Virtual Spaces: The global interest in virtual spaces and metaverses is on a significant rise. With more people spending time in virtual worlds for work, socializing, and entertainment, enhancing user engagement in platforms like Decentraland is crucial.\nDemand for Interactive Experiences: Users in digital environments increasingly seek interactive, dynamic experiences. An AMA feature caters to this demand, offering a new level of engagement.\nIncreasing Competition in the Metaverse Domain: With competitors like The Sandbox, Axie Infinity, and others gaining traction, Decentraland needs to continuously innovate to maintain and grow its user base.\nTechnological Advancements\nBlockchain and Smart Contract Evolution: Advancements in blockchain technology and smart contracts enable more secure, transparent, and interactive features like AMA within the metaverse.\nImproved Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Technologies: As VR and AR technologies become more accessible and advanced, integrating features that utilize these technologies can significantly enhance user experience in Decentraland.\nUser Engagement and Community Building\nFostering a Strong Community: AMAs are known for building and strengthening community bonds. In a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) like Decentraland, community engagement is vital for growth and sustainability.\nEmpowering Users with Knowledge and Interaction: The AMA feature allows users to directly interact with influencers, experts, and each other, fostering a sense of belonging and empowerment.\nCompetitive Edge\nUnique Selling Proposition (USP): Offering a robust AMA feature could be a significant USP for Decentraland, setting it apart from other metaverse platforms.\nFirst-Mover Advantage: Being one of the first in the metaverse space to implement a sophisticated AMA system could position Decentraland as an innovator and leader.\nEconomic Benefits\nAttracting New Users and Investors: Innovative features like AMA can attract new users and investors, potentially increasing the platform's token value and overall market capitalization.\nMonetization Opportunities: The AMA feature can open up new monetization channels through sponsorships, premium access, and more.\nAlignment with Decentraland’s Vision\nEnhancing User Autonomy and Experience: As a platform built on the principles of user autonomy and decentralized governance, introducing features that enhance user interaction aligns perfectly with Decentraland's ethos.\nConclusion\nInvesting in the AMA feature is not just a response to current market trends and technological advancements but also a strategic move to strengthen Decentraland's position in the competitive metaverse landscape. It aligns with the growing demand for interactive digital experiences, enhances community engagement, offers a competitive edge, and opens up new economic opportunities, all while staying true to the ethos of Decentraland’s decentralized, user-centric vision.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

QUESTION 1 Do you remember approving this MAJOR DECISION?\n\nOnce user completes quest, user is given 3 choices to \"Jump In\" - Genesis Plaza is only 1 of 3 options.  Instead sending users to the top-performing properties like Ice Poker, Wonder Mine it seems certain insiders have forced their lands on the jump ins similar to how specific wearables were shown in genesis plaza.  I have provided a screen shot to the default option I got when playing - Doll House.  QUESTION 2 - do you approve of default the \"place highlight\" jump in locations?\n\nNothing personal against Sinful, Buffalo, Stoney etc but this is damaging to the platform and none of the decisions went through the DAO to my knowledge (prove me wrong).  These buildings will typically not feature a live event where the top performing properties are \"always on\".   Secondly Doll House is famous for \"skampily clad\" persons, cage dancers and broadcasting content that some parents would take issue with.  It has only avoided age restriction due to insider action - the same way this is the new genesis plaza without a DAO vote.\n\nMy weed farm got age restricted.  I didn't complain at all because I can see where some parents won't want their kids to see it and certainly I could understand if I'm not eligible to be a \"jump in\" for genesis plaza or in this new onboarding.  I don't take an issue with drag story hour myself, but think it's asking for trouble having this as a jump in point and simultaneously not age restricted specifically with the Doll House.   DCL says they want to be inclusive - we should try to be respectful to those with more conservative values as well.\n\nFinally as a new user and new developer the insider actions are unwelcoming.  It feels like the cards are always stacked against the new user, we are outsiders who will always be oppressed by the oligarchs of DCL.\n\n- Yes, Yes\n- Yes, No\n- No, Yes\n- No, No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Check our last proposal here: https://shorturl.at/cHV03\n\nFull Proposal: https://shorturl.at/jtwL0\n\nMetaTrekkers’ mission has always been to become an immersive platform that allows artists to tap into endless opportunities in the metaverse. We want to use Decentraland DAO’s support to become an artist-supporting platform\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n150,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n4 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x50a83425d537e39a0b7f884dCC07e6f4F37A09F3\n\n## Email address\n\nhello@metatrekkers.io\n\n## Description\n\nMetaTrekkers, with over 2 years of experience in Decentraland, specializes in organizing events such as concerts and art shows. We understand that a vibrant environment relies on a close-knit community with access to diverse features, fostering interaction and engagement within the metaverse. Our goal is to be the platform that unites artist and metaverse-user communities, rewarding them for participating in a variety of entertainment events, sessions, and talks.\n\nEstablishing MetaTrekkers as an artist and entertainment platform, which constantly develops new concepts based on community involvement, will provide a ramp for Decentraland to multiply its reach and an incentive for artists and fans alike to discover the endless possibilities featured in a socially active, virtual environment. The possibility for the Decentraland DAO and the platform to become a hub for visionary artists who want to explore the virtual environment and experiment together with their following relies on investing in the proper partnership and communication opportunities, like the MetaTrekkers x Venice Music collaboration and the development of a Decentraland onboarding standard, which will be made available to all Decentraland venues through an open-source kit.\n\nBeatTrekkers 1\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/ZtJIsBl.png)\n\nBeatTrekkers 2\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/Z3GhMjY.png)\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/D79Wp01.jpg)\n\nBeatTrekkers is currently the biggest DJ battle series of events in the metaverse, BeatTrekkers is MetaTrekkers’ biggest initiative to date as it successfully concluded two (2) series already which engaged a total of thirty-six (36) competing artists, twenty-four (24) guest artists, the Decentraland and MetaTrekkers community, plus new audiences.\n\nSince we aim to give back to the community as much as we can, one of the main rewarding ideas within BeatTrekkers is to give fans & supporters access to the artists’ work, aside from live performances, in the form of wearables, and NFTs, we aim to constantly add value to both the user and artist’s experience, which is why using the grant to market and advertise the platform and events will be a direct investment into increase notoriety and exposure for the artists, bringing visitors and users to Decentraland and allowing us to offer increasingly attractive rewards for the community.\n\nThe BeatTrekkers series has the potential to become a platform for Decentraland to onboard artists in the music industry. We believe that by partnering with Decentraland, we can provide a unique and immersive experience for music fans and help grow the Decentraland community.\n\nAs BeatTrekkers, we have a proven track record of delivering high-quality music events & believe that our experience can help Decentraland reach wider audience. We commit to working with Decentraland to create a series of unforgettable events.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we are requesting a grant of $150,000. This funding will be used to cover the costs of marketing, event production, and artist fees. We believe that this grant will pay off in the form of increased awareness and adoption of Decentraland, as well as providing a fun and immersive experience for art and music fans.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nBeatTrekkers 1st Series (Finished Project)\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/ZwfuL34.png)\n\nCompilation of BeatTrekkers Series 1 Event Posters https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rQ_RrSOu9dg0jm262g7Oo-JPh4Fv-IDpdZl3TeNK4x0/edit\n\nBeatTrekkers Series 2 Series (Finished Project)\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/zTJIJYr.png)\n\nCompilation of BeatTrekkers Series 2 Event Posters\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\\_GkDKgJEWd402wq5Besd6FbjVgFo3qIS?usp=sharing\n\nBeatTrekkers Series 3 (Future Project)\n\nDescription:\n\nBeatTrekkers is a unique, innovative entertainment concept developed by MetaTrekkers NFT.

On top of that, we all agree that DCL needs to improve by an order of magnitude before it is going to be truly ready for mass adoption.\n\nRemoving the other categories will remove a great deal of the noise and stress within the DAO and allow the focus to return to building the platform.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nStop funding grants outside of the Platform category for all of 2024\n\nDo not allow Platform grants that are primarily focused on creating art.\n\nDo not allow the Platform grant to be used to fund private business enterprises.\n\nAllow funding to remain for Facillitaion Squad as they are responsible for promoting the DAO as well as moderation in working on improving communication with the Foundation which will continue to need improving if Decentraland is ever going to live up to it's potential.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nBest case scenario DAO saves lots of money and emotional stress on the community\n\nIn the worst case scenario, the dao saves lots of money on needless things and wastes some on some bad platform grants.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nWhen this Prop passes, all existing grants can run their course, and no new ones can be submitted other than Platform improving ones or any future Facilitation Squad grants.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt is in the best interest of the long-term health of Decentraland to focus on building a strong foundation. By focusing all of the Grant program energy on platform improvements we will be able to remove a lot of the noise, distraction, and bickering that currently plague the DAO.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xa01d51e047cd9b69850ebe2b472c54d458b378c2 (Huepow)\n\nWriting my first proposal for the integration of **World ID 2.0** (PROOF OF PERSONHOOD, ZERO-KNOWLEDGE PROOFS, SEMAPHORE) **passport** , created by Sam Altman, Alex Blania, into the Decentraland ecosystem as a revolutionary step towards ensuring a secure, humanlike and innovative metaverse. With the advent of advanced technologies and the growing concerns regarding digital identity verification, it's imperative that Decentraland adopts a mechanism that distinguishes real users from bots or secondary accounts effectively. World ID 2.0 presents an optimal solution to these challenges\n\n**Challenge Overview**\n\nDecentraland faces significant challenges in maintaining the integrity and value of its ecosystem due to the ease of creating multiple accounts. This issue particularly affects airdrops and the economy around wearables and chat interactions, as individuals can exploit these systems by accumulating assets through numerous accounts, thereby dropping them them on the market diluting their value and harming the genuine community engagement\n\n**Worldcoin Integration: A Solution**\n\nWorld ID 2.0 offers a unique and innovative approach to verifying human identity. Built on the Ethereum blockchain and running on the Optimism super chain, World ID 2.0 provides a decentralized and secure method of human identification through iris scanning technology. This technology is encapsulated in the Orb, an open-source device designed to ensure that each digital identity corresponds to a real human being without infringing on personal privacy\n\n**Benefits to Decentraland**\n\n1.  **Enhanced Security and Authenticity**: By integrating World ID 2.0, Decentraland can significantly reduce the presence of bots, duplicate accounts and malicious privat autonomous AI agents, ensuring that each account corresponds to a unique individual\n\n2.  **Fair Distribution of Assets**: World ID 2.0 identity verification system allows for equitable distribution mechanisms, such as airdrops, by ensuring that only verified human users can participate, thereby maintaining the value and scarcity of wearables and other assets.\n\n3.  **Innovation and Leadership**: Implementing World ID 2.0 positions Decentraland as a pioneer in the metaverse space, leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve issues of digital identity and asset distribution.\n\n4.  **Open-Source Collaboration**: With World ID 2.0 and the Orbs being fully open-source right now, Decentraland has the opportunity to contribute to, and benefit from, ongoing developments and community-driven enhancements in digital identity technology and future UBI distribution\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe integration of World ID 2.0 into Decentraland is not just a strategic move to enhance security and fairness but also a bold step towards embracing the future of digital interaction, identity verification, and community governance. With the rapid advancement of AI and autonomous agents, it's crucial that Decentraland leads the way in adopting technologies that secure and enrich the user experience.\n\nI believe that now is the opportune time to implement this integration, setting a first move in the metaverse community and ensuring a vibrant, humanlike  and secure future for all Decentraland users\n\nWhat is World ID 2.0? - [Link](https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/introducing-world-id-2.0)\n\nWhat is  ZERO-KNOWLEDGE PROOFS, SEMAPHORE - [Link](https://worldcoin.org/blog/worldcoin/intro-zero-knowledge-proofs-semaphore-application-world-id)\n\nWhat is PROOF OF PERSONHOOD? - [Link](https://worldcoin.org/blog/worldcoin/proof-of-personhood-what-it-is-why-its-needed)\n\n- Fully support the integration\n- upport, but have concerns\n- Undecided or need more information\n- Have specific concerns against the integration\n- Completely against the integration\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should stale profiles be removed from the Content Servers? (GOV)",
    "body": "> by 0xb8782cf628357ce2751a4ea3007934048fbaa672\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Should stale profiles be removed from the Content Servers? (DRAFT)](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ef127574-c39f-4544-8343-9f2abd32b087)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal addresses the accumulation of dormant profile entities in the content servers, outlining the necessity for their removal to optimize server resources and the synchronization time for new nodes.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nEstablish and implement a content server policy for the removal of stale profile entities, aiming to enhance server resource utilization and synchronization efficiency, particularly for new nodes. The focus is on profiles that have remained inactive for over a year.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe motivation stems from the accumulation of dormant profile entities on content servers that don't hold any value, impacting resource optimization and synchronization efficiency. The proposal seeks to address this by establishing a default behavior to permanently remove profiles inactive for more than a year. This approach aims to enhance synchronization processes, minimizing the download of unnecessary stale data during node synchronization.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nA new process will be implemented on the content servers to routinely assess all existing profiles and determine whether they should be retained. Currently, some nodes host over 2 million profiles, each consisting solely of information related to avatar configuration and outfit details.\n\nIn the event of a profile entity being lost or deleted, returning users will only need to reconfigure their avatar and outfit. No tangible content or ownership data would be compromised, given that ownership information is blockchain-based. Additionally, all owned assets remain accessible, as the 3D models for each asset will persist on the content servers.\n\nA profile entity is composed of a definition file, two snapshot PNG images (body.png and face.png), and an entry in the local database on the server. Through this cleanup process, these resources can be released, streamlining the system's efficiency.\n\nYou can validate the content of a profile entity by executing the following HTTP request and ensuring that it does not retain any historically valuable data. The profile entity works solely as an avatar configuration, capable of being reconstructed at any given time.\n\n`curl --location 'https://peer.decentraland.org/lambdas/profiles' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \\ --header 'Accept: application/json' \\ --data '{\n  \"ids\": [\n    \"0xAddress\"\n  ]\n}'`\n\n\n## Impacts\n\n*   The bootstrapping time for a new Catalyst node will see a substantial improvement. Currently, the process involves handling 2 million profiles and conducting blockchain validations for each profile entity, taking approximately 36 hours to start a new node.\n\n*   Enhance the efficiency of queries on the content server database for quicker resolution of user profiles.\n\n*   Reduce the storage footprint per Catalyst node by releasing several gigabytes of data.\n\n*   In the event of a profile deletion, a returning user will retain all their assets. The user will only need to navigate through the avatar configuration window, a fast and straightforward process.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nA new process will be created on the content servers to implement the stale profiles policy. This process will periodically scan all profile entities in the database, comparing their timestamps with the current date. If an entity's timestamp is older than a year, its database entry, associated entity file, and images will be removed from the server.\n\nThe development of this process will be executed in stages:\n\n*   Dev Stage:  Initially, it will be developed and tested in a development Catalyst in zone environment using Sepolia network. Once proven effective after testing it will move to a peer-testing node to revalidate its functionality with production data.\n\n*   Pre-Production: The peer-testing nodes contain all the production data, yet they function independently as standalone nodes. Any impact on these nodes does not propagate elsewhere. To validate the policy, it will undergo testing using this node with production data, with continuous monitoring of database changes for profile entities and tracking disk storage size. The process will be operational on a pre-production node for a minimum of one month to ensure its functionality aligns with expectations.\n\n*   Production: To mitigate risks, prior to applying the new version, backup snapshots of the servers will be generated. This precautionary measure ensures a viable disaster recovery pathway in case unforeseen issues arise during the rollout. A new catalyst version will be created and gradually be rollout to the nodes, once its behaviour is confirmed in a couple of production nodes it will be shared with all the catalyst owners to perform the upgrade.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed policy for the permanent removal of stale profile entities, those inactive for over a year, presents a solution to optimize server resources and improve synchronization efficiency for new Catalyst nodes. By implementing this policy, the content servers can be more efficient and minimizing the download of unnecessary, dormant data during synchronization.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x858343382132b9ab46c857a7d52fdbafc039f784 (Zino)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Refine Grant Categories and percentage of budget (Stage B)](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c5f7d542-1c21-4196-a0bf-6e65fa347c1b)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Grants Support Squad, with support of the Decentraland community, is considering changes to the budget distribution within the Grants Program. The goal is to reallocate funds based on community feedback and the historical usage of categories.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nAccording to the [Poll Proposal](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=ca29c34c-a5ab-41b4-80f1-482f3970550c) to improve the DAO Grants Program that passed, and the [Binding Governance Proposal](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=17b5f760-45e6-11ee-ab1f-97157a05bdec) which defined the current categories, we are moving forward with Stage B from the poll mentioned.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe are presenting a draft proposal of budget distribution, that takes into account the community feedback to reduce the percentage of allocation of budget from less used categories along with the increase of budget in categories that were used the most.\n\nTo come to these percentages, we have analyzed the [history of grants funded](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1an1YaLi0yZ7sqwCK5d9ydxfvU3cnzyIqI0V83RVarJ4/edit#gid=1942432593), which shows where the funds were allocated per Quarter, year, category, team/group requesting the fund, and which of those had concerns. We have also used as reference the amount of DAI allocated per category, taking the Q1- 2024 ($2,058,595) into account. We propose the following:\n\n*   Platform: 50% ($1,029,297.50)\n*   Core Unit: 15% ($308,789.25)\n*   In-world building (ex in-world content): 15% ($308,789.25)\n*   Community Experiences: 10% ($205,859.50)\n*   Social Media: 4% ($82,343.80)\n*   Sponsorship: 2% ($ 41,171.90)\n*   Accelerator: 2% ($ 41,171.90)\n*   Documentation: 2% ($ 41,171.90)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nFor more context, to propose this draft we considered the feedback gathered from the mentioned [poll ](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=ca29c34c-a5ab-41b4-80f1-482f3970550c), the governance proposal that passed to create the [category Community Experiences](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=17b5f760-45e6-11ee-ab1f-97157a05bdec), the rejected draft regarding the [budget distribution](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=d5c1c190-362c-11ee-be2d-676a2489bc16) in which the community expressed the need for platform category to have the higher percentage of the budget, and the Revocations Committee recommendations.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe proposed changes in the budget will have the following impact:\n\n*   A more efficient use of the budget based on historical community needs and requests\n*   A focused investment in the improvement of  Decentraland platform\n*   Reduction of budget from unused categories towards the allocation of the ones that will contribute to enhancing community engagement.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n*   The Grant Support Squad will update the DAO Documentation, following the specifications of this Governance Proposal.\n*   The Governance Squad will add the New Category - community experience- into the GovAPP, inside the Request a Grant section.\n*   The DAO Committee will calculate the new Budget for implementation in Q2 2024, considering the new distribution.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAllocating fewer funds to categories less used, allows the allocation the budget based on the community needs, avoiding abolishing categories completely. Category budget distribution helps maintain clarity about project requirements for the community of grantees to comply with the expected impact.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xd6c957f9a6411f35d01baae2658758f277408878 (Rizk)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Decentraland DAO Treasury Diversification ( Phase A )](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed44f5dd-bcf4-4e31-b41b-b48744c973d2)\n\n## Summary\n\nProposing strategic diversification by Investing 50% of quarterly unused Grant Program funds into Ethereum, enhancing resilience, liquidity, and long-term stability, Aligning with DAO's goal of stability in the decentralized virtual world.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nComparing our Decentraland DAO to other entities, organisations, or treasure boxes, we can observe that most of them always have a diversification of assets and investments to enhance their stability, reduce risks, and increase the overall value of their investments in the long run. In contrast, our DAO's value is closely tied to the assets we currently hold, which is primarily MANA.\n\nAfter analysing and understanding the importance of these assets to Decentraland and the DAO, as discussed in my article [Metaverse Triangle:DAO & Decentraland & MANA](https://medium.com/@rizk\\_57979/mana-decentraland-and-daos-the-metaversetriangle-015264ee17ac) , where I explained the value of MANA in our treasury and its impact on the DAO's overall value. The article highlights how a robust MANA treasury can positively influence the DAO's value, and vice versa. But a crucial piece should come into play: Ethereum. Which is worth considering the role of Ethereum in our strategy.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDecentraland runs on Ethereum, serving as the infrastructure for our virtual world. It ensures secure ownership, smooth transactions, and the intelligence behind smart contracts. Given our close connection to Ethereum and its impact on our assets and infrastructure—such as land transactions, MANA, and most of our contracts that is built on Ethereum—I believe that expanding our ETH holdings in the coming years will not only diversify our assets in the DAO but also provide long-term support to the chain we are built upon.\n\nThis strategic move can offer several benefits. It can enhance the DAO's resilience, and present opportunities to establish a liquidity pool in the future. Accumulating a substantial amount of ETH over time can make MANA more liquid and stable. Additionally, considering the increasing strength and deflationary nature of Ethereum, will contribute to long-term stability, and offers opportunities for liquidity pool establishment and staking income when we have enough eth at some point.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo strategically boost our Ethereum holdings, I propose using 50% of the unused funds from the [Grant Program's quarterly structure](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=bfab7b70-7b75-11ed-ad27-015f26e7c35c) . The program operates across four quarters with the formula,\n\n*5,500,000 \\* 0.7 = 3,850,000 mana/Q*\n\nAnd after I observed the unused amount of fund for the 2023 I found that we had the following approx unused fund for each quarter of 2023.\n\n        *  Q1: Grant program paused.\n        *  Q2: $880,000\n        *  Q3: Nearly zero (over budget)\n        *  Q4: $400,000\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nStarting the allocation and scaling of funds into Ethereum represents a definite positive impact on Decentraland DAO. This strategy brings benefits such as enhanced resilience, increased liquidity, long-term stability, and the potential to generate stable income through the establishment of a liquidity pool when the time comes.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nBased on the fluctuations and community poll results, I suggest utilizing 50% of each quarter's unused budget to gradually invest in ETH. DAO Committee members should:\n\n1- Take responsibility for implementing this proposal alongside their daily tasks and operations.\n\n2- Monitor quarterly unused budgets.\n\n3- Incrementally invest steadily and strategically in ETH each quarter, following this approach:\n\n               *   In Q2: Use 50% of Q1's unused fund \n               *   In Q3: Use 50% of Q2's unused fund \n               *   In Q4: Use 50% of Q3's unused fund \n               *   In Q1 (for the following year): Use 50% of Q4's unused fund\n\n**For those quarters that the Grant program get paused:** 30% of the total quarter budget (3,850,000 \\* 0.3 = 1,155,000 mana) will be allocated to buy ETH.\n\n**For revoked Grant funds:** Grants that receive a final decision from the revocation committee to be revoked will be added entirely to the 50% of the unused budget in the quarter of revocation, regardless of the original quarter of creation and vesting of that grant.\n\n*For example*, if the total unused fund for Q3 was $500,000, So **$250,000** will be used to buy ETH within that quarter, at that point, if a grant that got vested on Q1 and got revoked on Q3 with an amount of **$50,000**. Then, The total amount allocated for buying ETH in that quarter (Q3) will be $250,000 + $50,000 = **$300,000**.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this analysis highlights the need for diversification in Decentraland DAO's asset portfolio, especially considering the close tie to MANA. The proposed strategy emphasises the importance of Ethereum in enhancing the DAO's resilience and long-term stability. The specified approach of utilising 50% of unused funds for ETH investments, alongside careful monitoring, and quarterly scaling, aims to ensure a steady and strategic growth. This well-considered plan.\n\nThis initiative marks our first step towards diversifying the DAO, opening doors for further expansion and adaptability. It's crucial to note that these Ethereum investments are intended for long-term growth and not for short-term trading or profit-taking. This commitment aligns with our overarching goal of fostering stability and adaptability in the ever-evolving landscape of decentralised virtual worlds, reinforcing the DAO's position for sustained success.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

With the recent Implementation of \"Worlds\" to Eth names I'm surprised this doesn't already exist. Maybe it's in the works maybe not. Either way I wanted to shed some light on the subject. Not only will this just be another cool feature. It also resolves my previous proposal to lengthen unique names. I'm realizing now this maybe the only way to lengthen unique names. Considering DCL names are Eth Names only with .DCL.ETH instead of just .ETH. Allowing Eth names will give users the ability to add more characters to their name. For users who preferred name exceeds the current limit of 15 characters. This will allow us to have names of 18 characters. Making it possible for me to finally present my real Artist Name \"OfficialCryptoCube\".\nCertainly not certain but personally feel like. This shouldn't effect the sales of DCL names. As it's still a better deal for one trying to create a \"World\". Considering Eth names have a lease policy & DCL names are forever.\nPlease Help me upvote this Idea Fam!  For 3 years I've been hoping to present my Artist name proper and It's still not possible Lets make that change. #2024 🧊\n\n- Implement Eth Names As Unique Names\n- Do Not Implement Eth Names As Unique Names\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Integration of GBM Auctions in Decentraland’s Marketplace",
    "body": "> by 0x89a1d730aa1e78a0ede8dea988acecff0a6e99a9 (Szjanko)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe proposal suggests implementing GBM Bid-to-Earn auctions within Decentraland's marketplace.\n\nGBM Auction is a gamified auction mechanism where bidders make money if they are outbid. This can be in $MANA or whichever currency the auction is listed in and the percentage can be customizable by the auction creator.\n\nFor sellers this would incentivise users to participate and boost price discovery. GBM’s existing partners have seen a 200% increase in sales price.\n\nFor bidders & the community it would make use of the marketplace more rewarding and engaging where they either win the item or make money. Everybody walks away with something.\n\nGBM has completed over 70,000 auctions and is working with The Sandbox, Rarible, Unstoppable Domains and Aavegotchi just to name a few. The founders are fully doxxed and have been working in the blockchain space since 2018, whilst being involved as early as 2013.\n\nHugo McDonaugh, CEO, DCL Username ‘ObiWanKenobi’ - https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugomcdonaugh/\n\nEdouard Bessire, COO\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/edouardbessire/\n\nGuillaume Gonnaud, CTO\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaume-gonnaud/\n\n**Case Studies:**\n\n*   **Aavegotchi Experience:** Implementing GBM auctions led to a 160% increase in revenue. Aavegotchi's platform offers both a traditional P2P marketplace and GBM auctions ([Aavegotchi Auctions](https://dapp.aavegotchi.com/auction?status=live\\&itemType=all)).\n*   **Song A Day’s Success:** Transitioning to GBM auctions tripled their revenue in 100 days. High-profile endorsements, such as from Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, highlight its effectiveness ([Brian Armstrong Tweet](https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/1689482512203169793?s=20)).\n*   Other collaborations include Sandbox, Upland, and most recently with Unstoppable Domains, where again the asset sold for more than 100% higher than when English auctions were used.\n*   An empirical study also proved how the GBM auction system has a higher first bid, higher bids overall, a higher selling price, a higher revenue for the seller, fewer bids and takes less time to reach its final bid than an English auction — all other things being equal.  You can find it here:\n    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r-Z8xS1MenfWrPwpXqpoQ0pkGjGqv5Cm/view?usp=sharing\n\n**Statistics:**\n\n*   GBM auctions have successfully completed over 70,000 auctions\n*   Had over $200m in volume run through their bidding engine\n*   Generated over $54 million in revenue for their partners,\n*   Bidders across the world have earned over $6 million in incentives\n\n**Integration Process:**\nThe integration of GBM's dApp is a straightforward process, taking approximately 1-2 days for basic setup, where the customizable GBM dApp is used as the auction house and hosted by Decentraland as a subdomain. Alternatively, a more advanced implementation where GBM is integrated into the existing Decentraland marketplace itself, offering deeper customization, would require around 1-2 weeks of development time.\n\nEither option would include free white glove service and support from the GBM team working with the DCL devs for the smoothest possible integration.\n\n**Fee Structure:**\nThere is no upfront investment required. No fixed costs or monthly running fees. GBM charges a 2% fee only on sales made through GBM auctions. Fixed-price sales and other non-GBM transaction methods are exempt from this fee. Full project management support also included.\n\n**Links:**\nGBM Website:\nhttps://www.gbm.auction/\n\nGBM Auction Deck :\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jrxCZWzxIi3kB63yuMVGXsBK2yU_z1NrhmkehCNfJHg/edit?usp=share_link\n\nDecentraland demo:\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/17a10b9f893045c78eec311ff442e8b9?sid=584be386-dd72-4198-9749-3e544fb36b71\n\n**Voting Options:**\nThis poll seeks the community’s opinion on integrating GBM-style auctions into Decentraland's marketplace. The three options for this poll are the following:\n\n1.  **Full Integration of GBM Auctions:** This option proposes to fully integrate GBM auctions into Decentraland's marketplace. Under this model, GBM auctions would be integrated into the existing marketplace infrastructure which currently does not have auction capability. This approach aims to create an incentivized and dynamic marketplace with everything in one place. Users can still opt for existing sales mechanisms if they wish, GBM is just another option for them. Implementation support is included for free from the GBM team. Please see following mock-up of what it could look like:\n\n2.  **GBM Auctions as an Additional Option:** This choice suggests adding GBM auctions as an alternative alongside the existing marketplace structure. The Decentraland branded GBM dApp would act as a stand alone auction house, but still hosted under Decentraland's domain. It provides sellers and creators the flexibility to opt for either the traditional method or the GBM auction model for listing their assets and is also a lighter lift development wise. Implementation support is included for free from GBM team. Please see following video which shows exactly what this could look like:\n    https://www.loom.com/share/17a10b9f893045c78eec311ff442e8b9?sid=584be386-dd72-4198-9749-3e544fb36b71\n\n3.  **No Integration:** The third option is to retain the current marketplace model without integrating GBM auctions. This choice favors maintaining the existing system without introducing the new auction mechanism.\n\n- Yes, Full Integration of GBM Auctions into the marketplace\n- Yes, Add GBM Auctions dApp as a stand alone Decentraland auction house\n- No Integration\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should LinkedWearables be shut down?",
    "body": "> by 0x5e5d9d1dfd87e9b8b069b8e5d708db92be5ade99 (paralax)\n\n**What are linked wearables?**\n\nLinked Wearables are a solution for integrating third-party NFTs as wearables in Decentraland. The implementation involved third-party creators applying to the DAO for registration, with approved entities added to a Third Party Registry on the Polygon network. These registered parties can then upload 3D assets for their NFTs. To enable wearables, third parties must build a resolver API mapping their NFTs to items with a standardized API endpoint for Decentraland clients.\nThese third-party wearables differ from current Decentraland wearables in that publication fees vary based on collection size, and they cannot be independently traded in any marketplace. They serve as 3D representations of the source NFTs without having their own tradable tokens.\n\nMore details here: https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=14e76cc0-2bc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240\n\n**What is the problem with them?**\n\nThe concept of Linked Wearables is promising in expanding the scope of NFT functionality and utility. However, the current implementation raises significant concerns regarding the performance of the Decentraland client.\nThe in-world experience with linked wearables mirrors that of any regular wearable usable in Decentraland. Users can view and equip them from their backpacks. The main difference lies in the validation process that happens behind, where a Catalyst node, instead of consulting the blockchain, verifies ownership of the asset by using the third-party resolver API.\n\nWhen retrieving a profile from a Catalyst node, various validations are conducted to ensure that any equipped items in the profile genuinely belong to the associated wallet. In this architecture, the third-party API has a direct impact on the response time for resolving a Profile from a Catalyst node. As an example, Catalyst nodes offer an endpoint to request profile batches. If even one Profile in the batch has a linked wearable equipped, a slow third-party resolver API can significantly delay the entire batch response, leading to delays in rendering user profiles in the client.\n\n**What is the situation with the existing LinkedWearables providers?**\n\nCurrently, there are 19 API resolvers, but 5 of them have been inactive for several months. In July 2023, this performance issue was communicated to the third-party providers, requesting them to adhere to a Service Level Agreement with a target response time of 500 milliseconds. Additionally, providers were requested to implement a new endpoint capable of processing validations in batches while maintaining compliance with the specified SLA.\n\nRegrettably, the majority of providers failed to meet the SLA, and only a few implemented the newly requested endpoint with some of them responding with wrong validations.\n\nTo illustrate this concern, refer to the chart below, showing the average response time recorded by Catalyst nodes for third-party resolver responses. Unfortunately, the majority fall outside the desirable green area, surpassing the 500-millisecond threshold. Notably, some responses even take between 4 to 6 seconds, highlighting the severity of the issue.\n\n![times](https://i.postimg.cc/0Q4K4ZNV/times.png)\n\n![process](https://i.postimg.cc/PfLS5R1r/process.png)\n\nThis poll aims to seek consensus on shutting down all resolver APIs to improve client performance. While the product holds significant potential for extending the utility of NFTs, the existing implementation has the potential to negatively impact all users, including those who don't possess any 3P items. The previous DAO poll didn't progress to the draft or governance stages. Hence, it can be revisited to re-formulate a more effective implementation strategy that ensures optimal client performance.\n\n- yes\n- no\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xb8782cf628357ce2751a4ea3007934048fbaa672\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should stale profiles be removed from the Content Servers? ](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=3f4b6775-c43b-4e60-98d6-9133a6e2e4c2)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal addresses the accumulation of dormant profile entities in the content servers, outlining the necessity for their removal to optimize server resources and the synchronization time for new nodes.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nEstablish and implement a content server policy for the removal of stale profile entities, aiming to enhance server resource utilization and synchronization efficiency, particularly for new nodes. The focus is on profiles that have remained inactive for over a year.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe motivation stems from the accumulation of dormant profile entities on content servers that don't hold any value, impacting resource optimization and synchronization efficiency. The proposal seeks to address this by establishing a default behavior to permanently remove profiles inactive for more than a year. This approach aims to enhance synchronization processes, minimizing the download of unnecessary stale data during node synchronization.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nA new process will be implemented on the content servers to routinely assess all existing profiles and determine whether they should be retained. Currently, some nodes host over 2 million profiles, each consisting solely of information related to avatar configuration and outfit details.\n\nIn the event of a profile entity being lost or deleted, returning users will only need to reconfigure their avatar and outfit. No tangible content or ownership data would be compromised, given that ownership information is blockchain-based. Additionally, all owned assets remain accessible, as the 3D models for each asset will persist on the content servers.\n\nA profile entity is composed of a definition file, two snapshot PNG images (body.png and face.png), and an entry in the local database on the server. Through this cleanup process, these resources can be released, streamlining the system's efficiency.\n\nYou can validate the content of a profile entity by executing the following HTTP request and ensuring that it does not retain any historically valuable data. The profile entity works solely as an avatar configuration, capable of being reconstructed at any given time.\n\n`curl --location 'https://peer.decentraland.org/lambdas/profiles' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \\ --header 'Accept: application/json' \\ --data '{\n  \"ids\": [\n    \"0xAddress\"\n  ]\n}'`\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed policy for the permanent removal of stale profile entities, those inactive for over a year, presents a solution to optimize server resources and improve synchronization efficiency for new Catalyst nodes. By implementing this policy, the content servers can be more efficient and minimizing the download of unnecessary, dormant data during synchronization.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Also same process for spaces as well.\n\nWorking with the Ape community is they have a form can fill out for a tweet or retweet or spaces. However that is also gatekeeped since they can decide or not if they like the request depending on their objective opinion.  Decentraland does not even have that and is closed off by gatekeepers that unless apart of the core DAO or community does not even know who to contact for this. This process will make it more Decentralized. We can have a VP threshold for each (retweet, tweet, and spaces hosting)\n\nOpen all ideas for this.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This unit's mission is to: ***Enable users to make better decisions** by providing the information and technical infrastructure to do it **in a quick, easy, and delightful way***. They are responsible for maintaining and improving the **DAO Governance dApp, TransparencyOS,** and its ecosystem.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n133,399 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x3bf800b6F5c987b3738432068f789b7d131F1698\n\n## Email address\n\ngino@decentraland.org\n\n## Description\n\nFormed in January 2022 with a Community Grant from the Decentraland DAO, the DAO Governance Squad has evolved into a comprehensive product development team. Emphasizing open, agile methodologies, we engage with the community for feedback, enhancing the decentralized governance of the DAO, the Governance dApp, and its ecosystem. See **[how the platform looked back in January ‘22](https://web.archive.org/web/20211228134526/https://governance.decentraland.org/)** when we started developing it and how it looks now to understand the value delivered by our team.\n\nFor this Grant period, following community input on Core Unit's Grant proposals recently, we’ve **decided to cut our budget by 25%.** This decision stems from the recent downturn in the crypto and metaverse markets. While the situation is improving, **we believe in building efficiently during this market conditions to prepare for the next bull run**. Additionally, **the Governance platform has reached a level of maturity** that allows us to optimize our workload. Our focus now will be on implementing binding community decisions, improving existing features, maintaining critical platform aspects (like security and third-party integrations), and introducing some new features.\n\nA team like us must exist to ensure the continuity, decentralization, and security of the DAO ops but at this point, the effort is not the same as it was so **charging the DAO for the same workload that we had in the past looked unfair**. **The team will maintain all the current responsibilities** towards the community and in the future might look into other promising projects in the ecosystem.\n\nThe team will follow [agile development practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) to ensure a lean implementation of DAO governance requirements and continuous improvement of such features. The team will update the community via Project Updates, gather feedback using Canny, and answer questions at the open DAO Town Hall meetings and Discord server. Monthly Demo recordings will be provided as well.\n\nThe same Grant operational conditions detailed in the [original founding proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) still apply and the grant will be provided as a vesting contract in DAI assigned to 2-out-of-3 signatures [wallet](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x3bf800b6F5c987b3738432068f789b7d131F1698/transactions/history).\n\nCheck our [changelog](https://github.com/decentraland/governance/releases), our recorded [demos](https://www.notion.so/840079520e8742d0be9fa07bf2fe60f7?pvs=21), and the last project update with **a recap of all things shipped in the previous 6 months** [here](https://decentraland.org/governance/update/?id=7e3483f5-3b99-11ee-9496-2daa447e4bf3).

Providing simple, non-technical error explanations and possible troubleshooting steps can improve user satisfaction and retention.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPotential error messages will be rewritten in everyday language and each message will be accompanied by a set of recommended actions that users can take to resolve the problem. In the event that, due to complexity, it is not feasible to assign a precise description to each error message, a generic reason will be shown. This message should also appear alongside tips for possible solutions, such as checking your computer's time synchronization, ensuring VPNs are not in use, and other relevant steps.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy implementing user-friendly error messages, we can reduce user frustration and discontent, improve the overall experience, and potentially decrease the volume of support requests on the Discord server.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The reasons for resubmission are:\n\n*   Several key VP holders supported the grant idea and were inclined to vote 'YES.' However, due to a limited budget and competing funds in the same category with DCL Metrics, they opted to vote for them instead.\n*   The previous grant was overly technical. This time, I'll highlight practical use-cases for better understanding.\n*   Additionally, we've made a progress that we're eager to share.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n24,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x64ac332de46656CEf7733375252CaC593997CE57\n\n## Email address\n\ndigalgfund@pm.me\n\n## Description\n\nThis grant is aimed to bring AI technology to Decentraland through Open Source tools.\n\nObviously, AI & LLMs (Large Language Models) have changed the world in the last year. We hear from all that we will not interact with the world in the old manner. That's why we need to stay updated in this field in Decentraland.\n\nThis proposal outlines an advanced AI integration system with applications in virtual environments and language processing. It includes a customizable AI character, multilingual interaction capabilities, and diverse backend setups compatible with various LLMs like OpenAI and Open Source Models. Key tools such as MemGPT and AutoGen enhance AI character detailing and interaction.\n\nThe system's use cases are versatile, covering virtual guides in Decentraland for navigation and information, interactive storytelling and roleplay, AI companions for social interaction, innovative educational modules, and AI-driven customer service representatives, decorations, quests, audio & speech features.\n\nProgress from the last proposal:\n\n1.

    "title": "Should we add a second sun in the sky to match the Decentraland logo?",
    "body": "> by 0xd6eff8f07caf3443a1178407d3de4129149d6ef6 (Canessa)\n\nObjective:\nTo remain on brand by having our sky match the Official logo of Decentraland.\n\nProblem:\nRight now we have one sun in the sky in Decentraland, but our logo shows two suns on it. There is no clear reasoning as to why the logo has two suns. Without clear purpose, this logo remains unrelated to the actual world of Decentraland.\n\nConsiderations:\nThe Decentraland logo has had two distinct versions over time. The first consisted of two suns, a mountain range, and trees in the foreground. A later version, first seen in 2018/2019, also had two suns, with two prominent mountains as well. The constant between these two versions has been having two suns in the sky. In more recent times, the Decentraland DAO has created a derivative of the main logo, also with two suns in the sky.\n\nBenefits:\nStorybuilding is the most important aspect of good gaming experiences. Online fantasy worlds thrive off of creativity and uniqueness. Our logo is very distinct, as having two suns set Decentraland apart from other online platforms that adhere to the traditional one-sun sky. By adding a second sun to our sky, we can offer our users a unique visual effect, one that they cannot experience in the real world. To many of us, it does not make sense why we have two suns in our logo, and only one sun in our sky. There is a disconnect between our branding and what our world really looks like. By putting a second, smaller sun in our sky, we will be one step closer to building a cohesive and recognizable brand. Pictures of avatars with two suns in the sky will be more easily distinguished as Decentraland, and we will begin to build brand recognition.\n\nAs more users transition from Web2 to Web3, I believe it is important to build a strong brand representation here in Decentraland. This is one small way that we can improve our brand recognition across a global audience.\n\nPlease see additional images in the replies to this post. They will give you visual ideas of what the second sun might look like.\n\n- Yes, put a second sun in the sky\n- No, keep it like it is\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

After 2+ years of hard work, we utilized multiple events, especially the MetaMine seasons, to showcase our capability in effectively attracting brands to Decentraland and generating relatively large and sustainable traffic. And we have consistently worked towards reducing costs to make our project more sustainable by asking for smaller and smaller grants.\n\nhttps://github.com/MetaLiveStudio/MetaGamiMall_GA\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n38,800 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x654387b2c3A4E8E95fa13b03A48a24285503cD8c\n\n## Email address\n\nmetalivestudio@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n![2](https://i.imgur.com/4HUm5TE.jpg)\n\n**Main Achievements During the Last Grant Period in Six Months**\n\n**- Top 3 trendy scenes in Decentralnd for most of the time in the past 6 months (feel free to verify now)**\n\n**- 6,000+ new players onboarded to Decentraland, which is 20%+ more than what we promised in the last grant (Based on Playfab).**\n\n**- 220+ DAU (Daily Active Users) for Meta GamiMall Coins collecting via Main Scene, Side unified Scenes, and Coins smart wearables (Based on Playfab).**\n\n**- 22+ brands onboarded via 2 MetaMine Season 3.**\n\n**- 500+ wearables claimed in the Mall.**\n\n**- 50M+ coins were collected during the last grant period.**\n\n**- 100k+ views on Twitter solely for MetaMine-related tweets.**\n\n![3](https://i.imgur.com/y4S705t.png)\n\n**What’s Next?**\n\n**1/ Onboard more brands and players via MetaMine Season 4**\n\nAs always, we will onboard both Decentraland community projects and outside projects into MetaMine with their wearable sponsorship for the players, making announcements together to expose Decentraland.\n\n**2/Provide diverse types of incentives to attract both creators and players**\n\nRather than purely relying on providing wearable rewards as incentives, we plan to add new mechanisms and host more events with rewards to attract more contributors and players. For example, a long-term collecting game contest, builder contest, social media contest etc.\n\n**3/ Host more small-scale events to provide diverse experiences**\n\nOther than the MetaMine large-scale event, we aim to create a bi-weekly event with our collaborators and bring their community into Decentraland. This will help to provide a more sustainable excitement on top of our basic experience, which will in the end contribute to user retention.\n\n**Meta GamiMall Project Strategy**\n\n**Goal: Brands, Users, Retention**\n\n**Explanation: Meta GamiMall is a Metaverse mall with game features, rather than a game.** Our primary goal is to onboard as many brands and players into Decentraland as possible and keep them engaged. Instead of focusing on a highly entertaining experience, we concentrate on providing players with sufficient incentives, diverse routes to obtain the incentives, and a fair system to encourage prolonged participation. Simultaneously, we guide players to explore promotional materials for brands, increasing exposure and their willingness to participate in our experience. We will break down these details here due to the text limitation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dfYj4Nv0H1lUH\\_0oHgOMnJGbaGlrt33mP8kxcO0m5yE/edit?usp=sharing\n\n**Economic Sustainability**\n\nAlthough this is the 3rd time we have requested a grant, we have been working on our projects for 2 years and 3 months. Due to the absence of incentives for traffic generation from DAO or the Foundation, we still rely on DAO funds to operate our project, onboard brands, and maintain the user base. \\*\\*However, we continue to enhance the efficiency of the fund by requesting smaller grants while providing the same level of contribution to Decentraland (both traffic and brand onboarding).\\*\\*We sincerely hope this rationale makes sense to you as we attempt to save the budget for the DAO while ensuring our project can continue.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Month 1 Rebasing**\n\n*   Scene optimization (Model simplification, interaction simplification etc.)\n*   Expereince level up (Repolish the leaderboard feature to fit in the need of our new seasonal contest etc.)\n*   2 bi-week events (A community contest + Onboard a new community, the same as most of the below bi-week events)\n*   Social Media and Community Management\n*   Debug\n\n**Month 2 MetaMine Season 4 Preparation**\n\n*   MetaMine Season 4 documents preparation (Pitch deck and videos)\n*   MetaMine Season 4 Brands BD & Onboarding\n*   Expereince level up (Adding a Lucky Wheel mini experience to provide some extra surprise for players etc.)\n*   2 bi-week events\n*   Community Management\n*   Debug\n\n**Month3 MetaMine Season 4 Preparation**\n\n*   MetaMine Season 4 Brands BD & Onboarding\n*   Brands Materials preparation including making wearables and advertising materials etc.\n*   2 bi-week events\n*   Community Management\n*   Debug\n\n**Month 4 MetaMine Season 4 Pre-warm**\n\n*   Release the Teaser video\n*   Releasing advertisements to some niche metaverse community.\n*   Brands Materials preparation including making wearables, advertising materials etc.\n*   Listing wearables models in the mall and adding them to our reward-claiming smart contract.\n*   Promotion for MetaMine Season 4 on social media with all the brands onboard\n*   2 bi-week events\n*   Social Media and Community Management\n*   Debug\n\n**Month 5 MetaMine Season 4 Launch**\n\n*   Emergency Preparedness： Based on the previous experience, due to the large traffic that we might have. The start month of MetaMine Season 4 will be full of unexpected situations and bugs, thus need to reserve more time for this part.\n*   2 bi-week events (MetaMine Season 4 serious events)\n*   Social Media and Community Management\n\n**Month 6  MetaMine Season 4 Ongoing**\n\n*   MetaMine Season 4 Series Event with some of the onboarded brands.\n*   Develop at least one collaborative game with our partner using our unified scene technology.\n*   2 bi-week events\n*   Social Media and Community Management\n*   Debug\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The pause will have a maximum duration of three months then, the procedure will be as follows:\n\n*   The Grant Support Squad (GSS) will check if the project has caught up and If the project is on track again:\n    *   A new vesting contract can be created, requested by the GSS, with the period and funds remaining according to the original time frame proposed and considering the duration of the pause.\n    *   The original vesting contract will be unpaused if the project is on track according to the original roadmap and goals.\n\n*   If the grantee requests an extension of the pause granted (not exceeding three months), the project will be sent to the Revocations Committee (RC).\n    *   After that, if the project is on track again, a new vesting contract will be created, requested by the RC, with the period and funds remaining according to the original time frame proposed and considering the duration of the pause.\n\n*   if the grantee requests another extension to the Revocations Committee, the project should pass through a poll (created by a member of the Revocations Committee) to the Community, where they decide by a simple majority if the extension should be granted again.  ​​\n\n*   If the grantee decides to step down, the vesting contract will be revoked.\n\n[![J5SnQ6l.md.png](https://iili.io/J5SnQ6l.md.png)](https://freeimage.host/i/J5SnQ6l)\n\n[Flow](https://app.mural.co/t/decentralandflow6946/m/decentralandflow6946/1704371275228/693d92f9d9d0ec1e05022c09d8face3e41363c5b?sender=u736ceabf2ee729f706f15836)\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish a clear and fair framework for managing delays in projects funded by the DAO\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nInclude the requirement and the new flow proposed in the Grants program documentation.\nAlso, in the public [Grant Support Squad - Manual of Operations](https://www.notion.so/dcl-dao/Grant-Support-Squad-Manual-of-Operations-bc14cb2ffc0c4df18302bcffc6b60b2f?pvs=4)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish a clear and fair framework for managing delays in projects funded by the DAO\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The goal is to reallocate funds based on community feedback and the historical usage of categories.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nAccording to the [Poll Proposal](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=ca29c34c-a5ab-41b4-80f1-482f3970550c) to improve the DAO Grants Program that passed, and the [binding governance proposal](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=17b5f760-45e6-11ee-ab1f-97157a05bdec) which defined the current categories, we are moving forward with Stage B.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe are presenting a draft proposal of budget distribution, that takes into account the community feedback to reduce the percentage of allocation of budget from less used categories along with the increase of budget in categories that were used the most.\n\nTo come to these percentages, we have analyzed the [history of grants funded](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1an1YaLi0yZ7sqwCK5d9ydxfvU3cnzyIqI0V83RVarJ4/edit#gid=1942432593), which shows where the funds were allocated per Quarter, year, category, team/group requesting the fund, and which of those had concerns. We have also used as reference the amount of DAI allocated per category, taking the Q1- 2024 ($2,058,595) into account. We propose the following:\n\n*   Platform: 50% ($1,029,297.50)\n*   Core Unit: 15% ($308,789.25)\n*   In-world building (ex in-world content): 15% ($308,789.25)\n*   Community Experiences: 10% ($205,859.50)\n*   Social Media: 4% ($82,343.80)\n*   Sponsorship: 2% ($ 41,171.90)\n*   Accelerator: 2% ($ 41,171.90)\n*   Documentation: 2% ($ 41,171.90)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nFor more context, to propose this draft we considered the feedback gathered from the mentioned [poll ](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=ca29c34c-a5ab-41b4-80f1-482f3970550c), the governance proposal that passed to create the [category Community Experiences](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=17b5f760-45e6-11ee-ab1f-97157a05bdec), the rejected draft regarding the [budget distribution](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=d5c1c190-362c-11ee-be2d-676a2489bc16) in which the community expressed the need for platform category to have the higher percentage of the budget, among the Revocations Committee recommendations.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAllocating fewer funds to categories less used, allows to allocate the budget based on the community needs, avoiding abolishing categories completely.\nCategory budget distribution helps maintain clarity about project requirements for the community of grantees to comply with the expected impact.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should streaming in Decentraland be made easier?",
    "body": "> by 0xe945ed0530da54c1af15c6b034be9ef3e6bbe7b1 (OGContraBand)\n\nStreaming seems to be a central focus in Decentraland, yet it's difficult for users to do.  Most other platforms (facebook, youtube even theta) allow the user to simply generate stream key and use OBS.  Do you think Decentraland should provide the same service?\n\nThere may be a cost associated with network server traffic and monitoring so possibly the user need to pay X Mana to generate the stream key.  With moderation streaming on land / world using this feature can be a privilege lost to the wallet upon streaming any extreme/graphic/illegal content.\n\nI believe many more land holders will stream if this is an option and when they do of course they want to invite friends, people from other platforms.  This alone could see a big increase in users I believe.  If done right I think it can cover costs for servers and moderators too.  What do you think?

    "title": "Should stale profiles be removed from the Content Servers? ",
    "body": "> by 0x5e5d9d1dfd87e9b8b069b8e5d708db92be5ade99 (paralax)\n\nEach time a user logs into Decentraland with a Wallet, a Profile entity is generated and deployed to the Catalyst node and stored in a content server, subsequently synchronized with all the other nodes in the network. This Profile entity has details such as avatar configuration, including body shapes, eye colors, hair, and the current outfit. Presently, certain nodes have approximately 2M profile entities, and whenever a new node is initiated, it must download all these profiles and create a local copy.\nThe existing Garbage Collection system exclusively eliminates older versions of a Profiles, specifically when modifications are made on the same account or wallet. However, it is important to note that any profile entity ever created and uploaded to a catalyst server remains indefinitely. In essence, while changes to a profile trigger the removal of previous versions, profiles created years ago and left dormant on the platform persist forever. This perpetual retention accumulates profiles that may no longer serve any active purpose or will never be used again.\n\nIt's also important to highlight that the profile entity works solely as the avatar's configuration, while ownership and asset information associated with a wallet is securely stored on the blockchain. In the event that a profile entity is lost or deleted, users would only need to reconfigure the avatar and its outfit, no tangible content or ownership data would be compromised and all owned assets would be available.\n\nThis DAO poll is to gather consensus on the permanent removal of stale Profile entities from the Decentraland content servers. Managing stale content is necessary for optimizing server resources and improving efficiency. The proposed deletion rules for Profiles is detailed below:\n\nPermanently remove any profile that hasn’t had an update in over a year. After a years of inactivity, the profile entity may be removed from the content server.\n\nIf this policy is implemented, it would serve as the default behavior for managing stale profiles. This approach ensures that snapshots of profiles remain coherent, preventing the need for nodes to download extensive profile snapshots during synchronization. By minimizing the download of unnecessary stale data, this policy enhances the efficiency of the synchronization process.\n\n- yes\n- no\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (LordLike)\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nThis proposal gathers opinion about the introduction of a submission fee for [linked wearables](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/wearables/linked-wearables/#what-are-linked-wearables). Currently, the DAO bears all expenses related to the curation of linked wearables. To mitigate these substantial costs a submission fee could be implemented.\n\n**MOTIVATION**\n\nThis fee can enhance the quality of wearable submissions, mitigate the influx of non-serious entries and act as a compensation of expenses currently held by the DAO. It can be one of important steps in ensuring the long-term sustainability and quality of the ecosystem.\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION**\n\nThis is a non-binding pre-proposal poll to assess community sentiment. If approved, a working group will be formed to facilitate broader discussions and inputs, **including the review of fees paid to curators for linked wearables**. The finalized points will be submitted in next governance stages.\n\n**VOTING OPTIONS**\n\nYES: Implement a Linked Wearables Submission Fee.\n\nNO: Leave as it is.\n\nShare your thoughts related to this proposal on the [DAO Discord](https://discord.gg/CtbMGuSVjr) or in the comments.

As the game progresses folks can pop out to help beta test and work out any bugs.  Phase 1 - basic multiplayer mechanics testing joining a game, acting as host, test multiple games in 1 scene scenario.  Phase 2 - random number drawings and bingo card as sloppy text blob with auto marking, test winning feature, marking.  Phase 3 make it look nice and hone in on completion, manual markings feature, triggering emotes and sounds.  Phase 4 convert to smart wearable.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

We propose dividing POIs into specific categories to reflect their unique value and characteristics within the virtual environment.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n1.  To ensure that POIs provide distinct value to users.\n2.  To align POIs with Decentraland’s diverse offerings and standards.\n3.  To recognize the unique qualities of various POIs and their contribution to Decentraland.\n\n**Proposed Categories:**\n\n1.  **Venue POIs:** Places that regularly host events, such as clubs and event spaces.\n2.  **Art POIs:** Permanent installations that are valuable for their artistic merit, independent of events.\n3.  **Commercial POIs:** Locations representing commercial entities (e.g., brand stores) maintaining a presence in Decentraland.\n4.  **Legacy POIs:** Landmarks that showcase the history and evolution of Decentraland.\n5.  **Memorials.** Places dedicated to honor someone who has passed.\n6.  \\[Additional categories can be added based on community input.]\n\n**Implementation:**\nThis will be a non-binding pre-proposal poll to gauge community sentiment.

The pause will have a maximum duration of three months then, the procedure will be as follows:\n\n*   The Grant Support Squad (GSS) will check if the project has caught up and If the project is on track again:\n    *   A new vesting contract can be created, requested by the GSS, with the period and funds remaining according to the original time frame proposed and considering the duration of the pause.\n    *   The original vesting contract will be unpaused if the project is on track according to the original roadmap and goals.\n\n*   If the grantee requests an extension of the pause granted (not exceeding three months), the project will be sent to the Revocations Committee (RC).\n    *   After that, if the project is on track again, a new vesting contract will be created, requested by the RC, with the period and funds remaining according to the original time frame proposed and considering the duration of the pause.\n\n*   if the grantee requests another extension to the Revocations Committee, the project should pass through a poll (created by a member of the Revocations Committee) to the Community, where they decide by a simple majority if the extension should be granted again.  ​​\n\n*   If the grantee decides to step down, the vesting contract will be revoked.\n\n[![J5SnQ6l.md.png](https://iili.io/J5SnQ6l.md.png)](https://freeimage.host/i/J5SnQ6l)\n\n[Flow](https://app.mural.co/t/decentralandflow6946/m/decentralandflow6946/1704371275228/693d92f9d9d0ec1e05022c09d8face3e41363c5b?sender=u736ceabf2ee729f706f15836)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish a clear and fair framework for managing delays in projects funded by the DAO\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This gap can result in purchasing decisions with possible dissatisfaction.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed feature would integrate a button within the Marketplace interface. Upon clicking, users would see a real-time preview of selected wearables on their avatar in Decentraland, offering a more interactive and informed shopping experience.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nIncludes increased user engagement and satisfaction, potentially leading to higher sales and a more vibrant Marketplace.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThis would involve collaboration with the Decentraland development team to design and integrate the feature and seamlessly incorporated into the existing Marketplace interface.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nImplementing a \"View in Decentraland\" button would reduce the gap between the digital store and the virtual world enhancing user satisfaction and potentially increasing sales in the Marketplace.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x1b35f4d22b2c8bc706bcfcc383a1ca77fb4fc600 (punkpink)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Should the user be able to change the case of their NAME?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=67aa36f7-80fb-4fa3-87eb-d5fd7ff87a11)\n\n## Summary\n\nA proposal to allow users to modify the case (uppercase/lowercase) of their registered names in Decentraland.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines the importance and benefits of allowing users to alter the case of their registered names after the initial registration. It emphasizes the impact on personal and brand identity, accommodating the need for proper capitalization in names and brand titles.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe inability to modify the case of a registered name can lead to inconsistencies with personal or brand identity. This limitation can be particularly significant for brands where specific capitalization is integral to their image. Implementing this change will enhance user experience and brand representation in Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed change involves updating the Decentraland name registration system to allow users to adjust the case of their names. This would include both technical updates and a user-friendly interface for making these adjustments.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe proposed change is expected to enhance user satisfaction by providing greater control over their virtual identity. It will also benefit brands in maintaining consistency with their real-world branding.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe implementation would require:\n\n1 - Technical development to support case changes in the name registration system in a way that is visible everywhere on the platform (world and all Decentraland websites).\n\n2 -A user interface update to allow easy editing of name cases.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nImplementing the ability to change the case of registered names will significantly benefit users and brands in aligning their virtual identity with their real-world representation. This small change could have a considerable impact on user satisfaction and brand perception within Decentraland.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

To reduce overall cost for this project, we will work with an existing collection: The WANDERER Collection and redesign the digital outfits meet the design and technical requirements of Decentraland wearables while retaining their original aesthetics as much as possible. This will serve as a pilot program and our long-term goal is to elevate the utility of digital fashion by enabling users to seamlessly transition their stylish digital outfits to Decentraland. We want to create digital wearables that are thoughtfully designed for Decentraland avatars, not only meeting the technical requirements but optimizing aesthetics as well. These wearables serve as the initial point of engagement for new users, playing a crucial role in showcasing the allure of the Decentraland metaverse.\n\nThis initiative is a direct response to the need for more sophisticated virtual attire, catering to users seeking high-quality, trendsetting options for their avatars. By effectively bridging the gap between digital fashion and the distinctive aesthetics of the metaverse, our project aims to enhance user experiences and foster a vibrant virtual fashion community within Decentraland. We envision these efforts contributing to the platform's appeal and positioning Decentraland as a leading hub for innovative and stylish digital fashion experiences.\n\nWith a proven track record of launching visually stunning digital garments, our team is poised to contribute valuable and aesthetically pleasing content to the Decentraland community. Our collaboration with global designers fosters a dynamic ecosystem, showcasing diverse and culturally rich virtual fashion. This not only contributes to the vibrancy of the Decentraland community but also positions the platform as a hub for cutting-edge digital fashion.\n\nIn conclusion, Mononoke boasts a team with expertise in leveraging cutting-edge technologies, ensuring the seamless integration of digital outfits within the Decentraland platform. Our project's potential to redefine the virtual fashion landscape, enhance user engagement, and contribute to a sustainable and inclusive metaverse makes it a worthwhile investment for the future of Decentraland.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe expect the project to take a total of 5 weeks.\n\nWeek 1: Initial Development\n\nRedesigning The WANDERER Collection to meet Decentraland wearables' technical requirements while preserving original aesthetics.\n\nDefining concise technical specifications for digital garments.\n\nPrototyping initial designs for quick testing.\n\nWeek 2: Review & Revise\n\nReviewing outfits to ensure they meet aesthetic and technical requirements.\n\nGathering quick user feedback and making rapid adjustments.\n\nFinalizing technical specifications for seamless integration.\n\nWeek 3: Marketing and Community Engagement\n\nEngaging with the community to announce the upcoming launch.\n\nWeek 4: Continue Community Engagement\n\nContinued community engagement\n\nWeek 5: Launch\n\nOfficial launch of The WANDERER Collection in Decentraland.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Check our last proposal here: https://shorturl.at/cHV03\n\nFull Proposal: https://shorturl.at/jtwL0\n\nMetaTrekkers’ mission has always been to become an immersive platform that allows artists to tap into endless opportunities in the metaverse.  We want to use Decentraland DAO’s support to become an artist-supporting platform\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n150,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n4 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x50a83425d537e39a0b7f884dCC07e6f4F37A09F3\n\n## Email address\n\nhello@metatrekkers.io\n\n## Description\n\nMetaTrekkers has been developing, organizing, and hosting events in Decentraland for more than 2 years, whether it’s concerts or art shows, we have learned that the foundation for a thriving environment is a tight-knit community with access to a range of features that allow it to benefit from the interaction and engagement inside the metaverse. Knowing this, MetaTrekkers wants to become the platform that brings the artist and metaverse-user communities together and rewards them for their participation in various series of entertainment events, sessions, and talks.\n\nEstablishing MetaTrekkers as an artist and entertainment platform, which constantly develops new concepts based on community involvement, will provide a ramp for Decentraland to multiply its reach and an incentive for artists and fans alike to discover the endless possibilities featured in a socially active, virtual environment. The possibility for the Decentraland DAO and the platform to become a hub for visionary artists who want to explore the virtual environment and experiment together with their following relies on investing in the proper partnership and communication opportunities, like the MetaTrekkers x Venice Music collaboration and the development of a Decentraland onboarding standard, which will be made available to all Decentraland venues through an open-source kit.\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/CJnZwCM/Image-1-proposal.png\n\nBeatTrekkers is currently the biggest DJ battle series of events in the metaverse, BeatTrekkers is MetaTrekkers’ biggest initiative to date as it successfully concluded two (2) series already which engaged a total of thirty-six (36) competing artists, twenty-four (24) guest artists, the Decentraland and MetaTrekkers community, plus new audiences.\n\nSince we aim to give back to the community as much as we can, one of the main rewarding ideas within BeatTrekkers is to give fans and supporters access to the artists’ work, aside from live performances, in the form of wearables, and NFTs, we aim to constantly add value to both the user and artist’s experience, which is why using the grant to market and advertise the platform and events will be a direct investment into increased notoriety and exposure for the artists, bringing visitors and users to Decentraland and allowing us to offer increasingly attractive rewards for the community.\n\nThe BeatTrekkers series has the potential to become a platform for Decentraland to onboard artists in the music industry. We believe that by partnering with Decentraland, we can provide a unique and immersive experience for music fans and help grow the Decentraland community.\n\nAs BeatTrekkers, we have a proven track record of delivering high-quality music events and believe that our experience can help Decentraland reach a wider audience. We are committed to working with Decentraland to create a series of events that will be truly unforgettable.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we are requesting a grant of $150,000. This funding will be used to cover the costs of marketing, event production, and artist fees. We believe that this grant will pay off in the form of increased awareness and adoption of Decentraland, as well as providing a fun and immersive experience for art and music fans.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nBeatTrekkers 1st Series (Finished Project)\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/pKPsb7K/BT1-Schedule.png\n\nCompilation of BeatTrekkers Series 1 Event Posters https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rQ_RrSOu9dg0jm262g7Oo-JPh4Fv-IDpdZl3TeNK4x0/edit\n\nBeatTrekkers Series 2 Series (Finished Project)\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/YdJkpJJ/BT2-schedule.png\n\nCompilation of BeatTrekkers Series 2 Event Posters\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1\\_GkDKgJEWd402wq5Besd6FbjVgFo3qIS?usp=sharing\n\nBeatTrekkers Series 3 (Future Project)\n\nDescription:\n\nBeatTrekkers is a unique, innovative entertainment concept developed by MetaTrekkers NFT.

    "title": "Decentraland DAO Treasury Diversification ( Phase A )",
    "body": "> by 0xd6c957f9a6411f35d01baae2658758f277408878 (Rizk)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Decentraland DAO Treasury Diversification ](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5d11931b-32c3-4cea-81c9-25e45835374b)\n\n## Summary\n\nProposing strategic diversification by Investing 50% of quarterly unused Grant Program funds into Ethereum, enhancing resilience, liquidity, and long-term stability, Aligning with DAO's goal of stability in the decentralized virtual world.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nComparing our Decentraland DAO to other entities, organisations, or treasure boxes, we can observe that most of them always have a diversification of assets and investments to enhance their stability, reduce risks, and increase the overall value of their investments in the long run. In contrast, our DAO's value is closely tied to the assets we currently hold, which is primarily MANA.\n\nAfter analysing and understanding the importance of these assets to Decentraland and the DAO, as discussed in my article [Metaverse Triangle:DAO & Decentraland & MANA](https://medium.com/@rizk\\_57979/mana-decentraland-and-daos-the-metaversetriangle-015264ee17ac) , where I explained the value of MANA in our treasury and its impact on the DAO's overall value. The article highlights how a robust MANA treasury can positively influence the DAO's value, and vice versa. But a crucial piece should come into play: Ethereum. Which is worth considering the role of Ethereum in our strategy.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDecentraland runs on Ethereum, serving as the infrastructure for our virtual world. It ensures secure ownership, smooth transactions, and the intelligence behind smart contracts. Given our close connection to Ethereum and its impact on our assets and infrastructure—such as land transactions, MANA, and most of our contracts that is built on Ethereum—I believe that expanding our ETH holdings in the coming years will not only diversify our assets in the DAO but also provide long-term support to the chain we are built upon.\n\nThis strategic move can offer several benefits. It can enhance the DAO's resilience, and present opportunities to establish a liquidity pool in the future. Accumulating a substantial amount of ETH over time can make MANA more liquid and stable. Additionally, considering the increasing strength and deflationary nature of Ethereum, will contribute to long-term stability, and offers opportunities for liquidity pool establishment and staking income when we have enough eth at some point.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo strategically boost our Ethereum holdings, I propose using 50% of the unused funds from the [Grant Program's quarterly structure](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=bfab7b70-7b75-11ed-ad27-015f26e7c35c) . The program operates across four quarters with the formula,\n\n*5,500,000 \\* 0.7 = 3,850,000 mana/Q*\n\nAnd after I observed the unused amount of fund for the 2023 I found that we had the following approx unused fund for each quarter of 2023.\n\n        *  Q1: Grant program paused.\n        *  Q2: $880,000\n        *  Q3: Nearly zero (over budget)\n        *  Q4: $400,000\n\nBased on these fluctuations and the previous community poll results, I suggest using 50% of each quarter's unused budget to gradually invest in ETH. DAO Committee members should monitor quarterly unused budgets and incrementally invest steady, and strategically ETH investments in each quarter, following this approach:\n\n        *   In Q2: Use 50% of Q1's unused fund \n        *   In Q3: Use 50% of Q2's unused fund \n        *   In Q4: Use 50% of Q3's unused fund \n        *   In Q1 (for the following year): Use 50% of Q4's unused fund\n\n**For those quarters that the Grant program get paused:** 30% of the total quarter budget (3,850,000 \\* 0.3 = 1,155,000 mana) will be allocated to buy ETH.\n\n**For revoked Grant funds:** Any funds revoked from grants will be added entirely to the 50% of the unused budget in the quarter of revocation, regardless of the original quarter of creation and vesting of that grant.\n\n*For example*, if the total unused fund for Q3 was $500,000, So **$250,000** will be used to buy ETH within that quarter, at that point, if a grant that got vested on Q1 and got revoked on Q3 with an amount of **$50,000**. Then, The total amount allocated for buying ETH in that quarter (Q3) will be $250,000 + $50,000 = **$300,000**.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this analysis highlights the need for diversification in Decentraland DAO's asset portfolio, especially considering the close tie to MANA. The proposed strategy emphasises the importance of Ethereum in enhancing the DAO's resilience and long-term stability. The specified approach of utilising 50% of unused funds for ETH investments, alongside careful monitoring, and quarterly scaling, aims to ensure a steady and strategic growth. This well-considered plan.\n\nThis initiative marks our first step towards diversifying the DAO, opening doors for further expansion and adaptability. It's crucial to note that these Ethereum investments are intended for long-term growth and not for short-term trading or profit-taking. This commitment aligns with our overarching goal of fostering stability and adaptability in the ever-evolving landscape of decentralised virtual worlds, reinforcing the DAO's position for sustained success.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Discord with \"Forums\", \"Server Guide\" features will allow users to find all information in few seconds.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n95,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n12 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x41eb5F82af60873b3C14fEDB898A1712f5c35366\n\n## Email address\n\ntheankoudev@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nDecentraland Creators Community idea has began from issues that came with grant proposals regards 3d modelling tutorials and assets libraries. DAO spent thousands of dollars for this grants, and end up with barely usable result.\n\nThere are lots of issues that creators and users encounter nowadays without solution:\n\n*   low quality free assets (lack of quality, lack of source files, lack of guidelines, user unfriendly content)\n*   outdated documentation (lack of in-depth information from advanced/expert creators, broken links, missing information)\n*   builder and curation process issues (builder bugs, thousands of questions regards curation process)\n*   overloaded awesome repository with lack of assets for 3d content creators (most of awesome repository resources are more focused on source code development content)\n*   impossibility to find content created with Grant Proposals (video-tutorials, documentations, GitHub repositories)\n*   lack of communication with curators (forum topic messages limit, inactive curators)\n*   lack of activity in creators channel at official discord\n\nSolution that community will provide for issues listed above:\n\n### Discord Server\n\nThis is a core of Decentraland Creators Community.\n\nLink to that Discord Server should be added to Decentraland Documentation and official Decentraland Discord Communities.\n\nWith features (server guide, forums, voice chat, text chat, bots), Discord is a great solution for creators community needs. For now, there are no better alternatives than discord.\n\nCommunity will provide active support to users, do a voice calls, meetings, streams, interviews, write guidelines at Advanced Documentation and do assets for Assets Studio.\n\nDiscord Server is solution that will engage and grow new creators and users to Decentraland.\n\n### Advanced Documentation\n\nThis is a very well managed Discord Forums.\n\nEach forum will contain guidelines, each guideline will contain text information with pictures, link to YouTube tutorial (if needed), and link to Assets Studio repository (if needed)\n\nTo achieve best navigation inside forums, \"Servers Guide\" feature will navigate users throughout all guidelines with simple, sorted way. Optionally, it's able to manually navigate inside forums.\n\nCreators will write guidelines with different levels of difficulty (Basic, Advanced, Expert) for payment from this grant proposal.\n\nUsers will use this guidelines to learn, practice in creation of emotes, wearables, and 3d assets.\n\n### Assets Studio\n\nAssets Studio is Discord Forum Guidelines and GitHub Repository with assets made by creators and sorted in folders. This solution provide a huge reduce of risks and expenses for DAO.\n\nCreators idea should pass vote through DAO pre-proposal. If vote pass, we will discuss budget and start project.\n\nAssets will include:\n\n*   models, textures, thumbnails\n*   source files\n*   scripts and addons (optional)\n*   guidelines and YouTube tutorials (from discord forums)\n\nI will hire creators from Decentraland for each category (Discord Server, Advanced Documentation, Assets Studio) and pay them from this grant proposal budget.\n\nMost of budget money will go to creators as payment for content.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nFirst 12 months will be main phase of focused hard work on Advanced Documentation and Assets Studio content.\n\n### January\n\n*   Discord Server Setup\n*   GitHub Repository Setup (New or Decentraland GitHub?)\n*   YouTube Channel Setup (New or Decentraland YouTube Channel?)\n*   Templates for Creators\n*   Channel Startup\n\n### February\n\n*   Creators Recruitment\n*   Documentation Startup\n\n### March - December\n\n*   Discord Server Maintain\n*   Documentation Startup and Expansion\n*   Assets Studio Startup and Expansion\n\n### Documentation Roadmap (Example). Full Roadmap will be in Discord.\n\n*   Basic Guidelines\n    *   Your First Wearable\n    *   Creators Content\n    *   Curation Process, Builder Issues, Test Servers Issues\n*   Advanced Guidelines\n    *   GLTF + Textures\n    *   Weight Painting\n    *   Dope Sheet and Curves\n    *   Creators Content\n*   Expert Guidelines\n    *   Particles\n    *   Advanced Weight Painting\n    *   Sounds, Props, and Particles\n    *   Creators Content\n\n### Assets Studio Roadmap (Example). Full Roadmap will be in Discord.\n\n*   Lightshow Library\n*   Base Assets HQ\n*   Flexible Particles\n*   Hairs Constructor\n*   Creators Content\n\nAs soon as 12 months will pass, we will discuss with community next phase. According to community conclusion, channel phase will move to one of this options:\n\n*   If  community is useless, server will stay active as library with minimal support and minimal maintain. Do not require grant proposal renewal.\n*   If community is helpful, but information is not enough or roadmap is unfinished, we will continue expand our server with information and useful assets. Requires Grant proposal renewal and revision of budget.\n*   If there enough of assets and information for users, discord server will move to maintain phase. Creators will support new users and will maintain their guidelines and assets. Salaries will be reduced to minimum. Guidelines and Assets creation will be reduced to minimum. Only very unique ideas will be accepted for guidelines and assets. Requires Grant proposal renewal with minimal budget for lifetime support.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x895be97bdb9f8a244c472b18ea96dee39ddf8fe5 (dax)\n\nShould the following $40,800 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAfter gathering feedback from many of you in the past weeks since our previous attempt, we have decided to try again for a continuation grant to not only keep DCL-Metrics alive but expand the metrics we offer. We are looking forward to getting back to work!\n\nThe main things we want to implement are quality of life features to make the grant process easier to track and understand for grantees, the GSS and the community at large. Please see full description below.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n40,800 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n10 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x895Be97bDb9F8a244c472B18EA96DeE39ddf8fe5\n\n## Email address\n\ndax.dcl@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nIn short, DCL-Metrics is a global, public metrics platform for Decentraland and we aim to give a bird's eye view of traffic and users.\n\nWe do not have the data fidelity of analytics trackers that live in individual scenes but in our estimation that's okay. We're not aiming to be google analytics which gives you every detail about the users that come to your parcel. Instead, we want to showcase the broader view of the world and eventually get to the point where this compiled data is accessible via API.\n\nFor more details about what we have implemented already, please see our [previous grant proposal](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=87fa6ad0-605b-11ee-af3f-d9f6b00b3bf3) or visit [our site](https://www.dcl-metrics.com)\n\n**Updates**\n\nThe biggest changes we have made in this resubmission are as follows:\n\n*   Decreasing our salary\\\n    Based on talks with community members, we've reduced our salary from 1666/month to 1500/month for the 10 months of this grant. This does not take into consideration long-term maintenance which will occur after the 10 months - or, if you like, our salary is 625 / month if averaged over the 24 months.\n*   Adding more features\\\n    These are the QoL improvements, see below.\n*   Cutting the Freelance Budget\n*   Cutting infrastructure costs to 450 / month.\\\n    During the last months, we considered closing the project as running it without grant funding is, at this time, untenable. I made some improvements to the infrastructure and shifted data around so that I could costs.\n*   Lengthening the runway from 9 months to 24 months\\\n    With a slightly lower infrastructure budget and trading speed improvements for longevity, we've prioritized keeping the lights on for as long as possible. In these 24 months of budget to cover basic infrastructure costs, we hope to get an API up and running so that we can fund future development. The cost of that development is NOT part of this grant. At this point, we do not plan to ask for a grant for that development work.\n\n**Planned Features**\n\nNot in order of implementation - see roadmap\n\n*   Quality of Life Improvements\n    *   Live scene traffic reports\n    *   Full Scene history\n    *   Scene History by Date Range\n    *   CSV download of scene stats\n\n*   Event tracker\n    *   Tracking details of major events\n    *   Dedicated data page per event\n    *   Attaching events to other models (scenes/ users/ etc)\n\n*   Atlas Corp historical user data integration\n    *   https://governance.decentraland.org/update/?id=46271910-19b0-11ee-93a7-ed9294f83f74\\&proposalId=21db21b0-bc53-11ed-8c13-518b5c1940be\n\n*   Historical scene history and expanded data scope e.g.\n    *   Top users of a given scene over time\n    *   Retention metrics\n    *   New / guest / named users historical charts\n\n*   Land / scene utilization graph e.g.\n    *   Display ratio of utilized LANDs\n\n*   Additional Worlds data\n    *   Historical data\n    *   Deeper integration with /user page\n\n*   Retention metrics\n    *   Calculate retention rate of a given scene / dcl in total - how many users returned after 7 days / 14 days / etc\n\n*   Improved UI/UX\n    *   Variety of formatting of the chart\n    *   Consistency of data + FAQ / legends for better readability for users\n\n*   Clean up technical debt for sustainability\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n2024 Q1\n\n*   Event Tracker\n*   Additional Worlds Data\n\n2024 Q2\n\n*   Historical scene history & expanded data scope\n*   Quality of Life improvements\n\n2024 Q3\n\n*   Atlas corps historical user data integration\n*   Rentention Metrics\n\n2024 Q4\n\n*   Land / Scene utilization\n\n2025+\n\n*   Long-term maintenance and internal features leading to API accessibility in time for the bull market ;)\n\nData consistency & technical debt tasks will be split across the whole roadmap\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

We have to build something easy to learn and interact with.\n\nIn the beginning, this class should be free. I hope the DAO can provide funds for class operation. We can think about it as a Marketing Campaign. Our platform now is too lack players, we need to make our platform more vibrant.\n\nIn the future, when everything is running smoothly, we can consider charging users.

Exodus will add skills like potion making and farming while also refining the user experience, game's scene and designs, and expanding already developed content (like mining and fishing) to support more engaging mechanics and multiplayer interactions.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n85,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x5117571b0BEc00372CE00870ad8E523C704a78b7\n\n## Email address\n\nexodusgbw@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\"Exodus: Goodbye World\" (Exodus) is a multiplayer roleplaying game (RPG) aimed towards providing Decentraland users with an engaging as well as rewarding in-world experience. In Exodus, players have a large choice of skills and activities in which they can gather resources, produces new items, earn experience points, earn in-game currency, earn NFTs, trade, and interact with other players. Exodus provides hundreds of hours of activities and content, making it a valuable asset for user retention and engagement.\n\nIn 2023, Exodus has reached a net of 8000 all-time accounts created, having a current average of 75 weekly unique users. During that same time, Exodus released a variety of content and hosted several in-world holiday events. To give some examples, in 2023 Exodus released: Player-to-Player trading, Multiplayer Item Dropping, Workshopping Skill, Combat Alpha Content, Player Owned Pets, UI Overhauls, Scene Overhauls. As well, Exodus hosted multiplayer in-world events for: Valentines Day, Easter, Business Week, Exodus's Birthday, and Thanksgiving. Exodus’s holiday events always offer a boon to player engagement, with past events averaging in around 500 new accounts created per event and 2000 NFTs given out as gameplay rewards. We believe that Decentraland needs engaging games like Exodus in order to retain DAU and drive organic growth. Exodus provides a fun experience where users play can interact with each other for a large number of hours without running out of activities or things to do. Moreover, consistently hosting interactive holiday events helps retain existing and returning users by providing them with consistent updates and content to look forward to.\n\nCheck out our socials at: https://X.com/ExodusGBW\n\nPlay at: https://play.decentraland.org/?realm=baldr\\&position=124%2C55\\&island=baldr1u7q\n\n**Enhancements**\n\nExpanding Exodus by introducing new skills and multiplayer mechanics will further refine Exodus' ability to attract new users and retain them. With this grant, Exodus will focus on a few primary objectives: Potion Making, Farming, and Multiplayer Enhancements.  The introduction of our Potion Making and Farming skills will provide even more hours of content for our players as well as prove our commitment to releasing new content for already existing players. Lastly, we intend to enhance already existing content, like fishing, mining, and woodcutting, to have multiplayer features - this will help make our content more engaging and interactive.\n\nIn addition to these enhancements, Exodus plans to be a regular and continuing host of in-world events for a variety of holidays. In the upcoming future, Exodus will be hosting events for Valentines Day, and Easter.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur intended content roadmap for the 6 month grant period be as follows. Note that development of features may overlap based on our development and release cycle.\n\n**Farming Skill**\n\n*   Estimated 2 months timeline. Goals include creation of plants and seeds 3D and 2D assets, animations for growing plants, backend programming for skill, front-end integration.\n\n**Potion Making Skill**\n\n*   Estimated 2 month timeline. Goals include creation of potion 3D and 2D assets, backend programming for skill, front-end integration.\n\n**Pet Cosmetic Skins**\n\n*   Estimate 1 month timeline. Goals include creation of alternative pet appearances and integrating the ability of player to choose appearance.\n\n**Multiplayer Resource Gathering**\n\n*   Estimated 2 months timeline. Will make resource gathering a multiplayer experience. Goals include backend updates to keep track of resources and respawning, front-end updates for triggering animations.\n\nWe will update the community on a monthly basis as to the progress of each feature. Once completed, we will release the content to be deployed in world within the following month.\n\nWe will host in-world events for: Christmas, Valentine's Day, Easter. We will report user engagement metrics in our grant updates for each event.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Once he/she has 1000 'memory', his 'memory' will be too full and his next gain will be turned to the time of 'virtual'. There are three realms in MetaTime, 'Time Valley', 'Thirty-six skies' and 'Eternal', coordinating with three times phases, 'Yesterday', 'now', and 'tomorrow'. The 'memory' accumulation is where the game begins, when the Metaverse are in the time of 'Yesterday' and space of 'Time Valley'. Many props are designed for players to enhance their capabilities so they can finally reach the realm of 'Eternal'. The best players will be listed on the top of the sky forever to be respected by all else below.\n\nBesides the road to God plot, there are games of real-life style for people to enjoy their precious time with relax and meanings, for example, go to the garden aside the moon to seed their wishes or water others wishes.

These ambassadors\nwill be entrusted with organizing and leading IRL meetups, hackathons, talks, and\nother events, with the official support of the Decentraland Foundation and the\nDecentraland DAO. These Ambassadors will be responsible for organizing and\nhosting 2 local events in their area.\n\nWe are pleased to announce we have concluded the interview process! We have 16 talented and passionate applicants, and we’re excited to see the diverse representation from around the world! You are welcome to watch the interviews to gain more information on each candidate. Two locations have multiple applicants, and these candidates have agreed they would be willing to work with each other to plan their events.\n\nInterviews can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NF3RG4kL4DD7sOTppYk-dwAdQz8\\_5Tpm\n\nThe countries representing these applicants are:\nChina,\nBrasil,\nDubai,\nGhana, West Africa,\nJapan (Two Ambassadors working together),\nIndia (Chandigarh),\nIndia (Delhi),\nMalaysia,\nSingapore,\nSpain (Two Ambassadors working together),\nUnited Kingdom,\nUnited States (Los Angeles),\nUnited States (Washington DC),\nUruguay\n\nAccording to the original grant, the final step of this process would be to put all applicants to a community vote where only 10 will proceed to the final Ambassador role.\nInstead, we recommend that the community invite all 16 applicants to become Ambassadors representing Decentraland around the world. We will not be asking for additional funding; the existing funds will be spread out amongst these 14 locations.\n\nBenefits of this modification would be:\nWider representation across the globe to reach a broader audience.\nIncreased potential for learnings across geographies.\nEven more collaboration, especially in countries with two ambassadors\n\nQuestions:\n\nIs the grant deviating from the original proposal?\nNo. The original amount asked for in the proposal will not change.\n\nHow will this affect the budget for the program?\nWe have made adjustments to the overall budget, and believe each area will have enough funds to curate quality events. When creating the initial budget, we had to estimate our costs based on having both higher cost of living areas and lower cost of living areas. Now that we know the exact location of events, our budget can more accurately reflect the costs we expect to incur.\n\nWill you be asking for more money over the duration of this grant?\nNo. We will work within the parameters of the grant that the community already approved. This change will not cost the community any more money.\n\n- Yes, accept all 16 applicants\n- No, let the community vote for 10\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This pause period cannot exceed 30 days, during which the Revocations Committee may request further information, extending the 6-day response period but not exceeding 30 days total. [Art. 9 point 5 - Revocations Committee framework](https://www.notion.so/dcl-dao/1-Revocations-Committee-Framework-2f5169fa11564574a090209be927b97d?pvs=4).\n\n*   **Pause Requested by Grantee Due to Delays: Currently, there is no specified maximum duration for this type of pause.**\n\n**Proposal:** The Grant Support Squad recommends a three-month pause duration.\nIf a project requires an extension beyond this period,  it should undergo a review by the Revocations Committee to assess the need for a new vesting contract.\nIf the period of time ends without catch up, the vesting contract will be sent to the Revocations Committee\nWe want the community's opinion on what the maximum pause duration should be in this scenario.\n\n**Additional valuable Information:** To provide further context, we have examples of past pauses (before the creation of the Revocations Committee) that demonstrate the need for flexibility and community input:\n\ncase A) [The Uncensored Library in Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=efddde80-bf1b-11ec-86b8-5dac6b550fc4) was paused in October 2022 and **is now, after 12 months,  requesting the release of remaining funds,** as the project is supposed to be on track (the GSS will review the case).\n\ncase B) [Polkadot - Substrate integration and education - BUITL:](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=1c5a5390-69a7-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598) was paused **8 months ago and is now requesting the release of remaining funds due to project progress** (similar case as Uncensored Library).\n\ncase C) [CROSSVERSE: A cross-metaverse play, learn, explore-to-earn game experience](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=7e4f37c0-0e65-11ed-9d53-7b405ea02bcb) was paused in November 2022 due to an existing blocker.  4 months later, the Worlds Feature was presented, allowing the project to continue development.\n\n- 1 month\n- 3 months\n- 6 month\n- Other option (please, specify in the forum)\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should VP requirements for Grants be reduced if grantees decide to receive MANA?",
    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct)\n\nCurrently, grantees can receive payouts in either DAI (a decentralized stablecoin pegged to the USD) or MANA (Decentraland's native utility token). The payouts are structured through a vesting contract with a maximum duration of 12 months. Currently, most grantees prefer DAI due to its stability compared to the more volatile MANA. The problem is that the DAO Treasury predominantly holds MANA. Funding grants in DAI require the DAO Committee to swap MANA for DAI, creating selling pressure on the MANA token and potentially impacting its market value negatively.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nTo encourage grantees to opt for MANA over DAI and to reduce the selling pressure on MANA, this proposal suggests lowering the VP requirements for proposals that request payouts in MANA. This adjustment aims to incentivize grantees to invest in the long-term value of the project and its native token.\n\n**Example**\n\nUnder the proposed system, a grant request of 10,000 USD in DAI that currently requires 2 million VP for approval would only need 1.8 million VP if the payout is requested in MANA.\n\n**Objective**\n\nThis proposal aims to align grantees’ interests with the long-term value of Decentraland and its native economy. By choosing MANA, grantees demonstrate their confidence in the project, contributing to a more stable and robust ecosystem.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xd6c957f9a6411f35d01baae2658758f277408878 (Rizk)\n\n**Introduction**:\n\nOur DAO's value is tied to the assets we hold, and right now, it's mostly MANA. I analysed the importance of this connection in my article [Metaverse Triangle : DAO & Decentraland & MANA](https://medium.com/@rizk\\_57979/mana-decentraland-and-daos-the-metaversetriangle-015264ee17ac) and explained in depth the value of the mana (asset) we have in the treasury to the value of the DAO in general. highlighting how a robust MANA treasury bolsters the DAO's value. But there's another crucial piece: *Ethereum.*\nDecentraland runs on Ethereum, making it the bedrock and the main base of our virtual world. It ensures secure ownership, smooth transactions, and the smarts powering smart contracts. That's why I propose carefully expanding our ETH holdings over the next couple of years.\n\n**Strategy for Growth:**\n\nTo strategically increase our Ethereum holdings in the treasury, I propose a systematic approach within a percentage of the Unused fund of the [Grant Program's quarterly structure](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=bfab7b70-7b75-11ed-ad27-015f26e7c35c) . The program operates across four quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4), with a predefined maximum mana allocation determined by the formula:\n*5,500,000 \\* 0.7 = 3,850,000 mana/Q.*\n\n*In instances when we dont reach the quarterly maximum limit, as seen in Q4-2023, with an unused amount of  ≈$400k from the allocated funds for this quarter's grants fund, I propose utilizing these funds to purchase Ethereum. The community would have a decisive role in determining the percentage—whether it's 25%, 50%, or 75%.*\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis innovative approach ensures that, in quarters where optimal grants aren't fully utilised, we can leverage the remaining funds to incrementally buy Ethereum. *It's important to note that in some months, when the entire budget is utilised, we won't proceed with Ethereum purchases during those quarters, while other months like Q4 2023 we have a budget for such action.*\n\nWhile individual transactions may appear modest, their cumulative impact over the long run can significantly enhance our asset holdings and fortify the treasury. This method aligns with our commitment to prudent financial management and sustainable growth of our treasury.\n\n- 25% of the unused budget\n- 50% of the unused budget\n- 75% of the unused budget\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Genesis Plaza has been the main location since the beginning.  It may be iconic, however it has seen little change since I first came in almost 2 years ago.  I remember coming in and looking around to see what there was to do here.  The events boards take some time to figure out how to work and some more to actually find an event that was happenning.  It leads to games that don't work and have not change or to events that are over.  There is not much of anything to do or anything to tell you how to get around and find something to do.  Angzaar plaza at least has a gamification aspect, it has a marketplace, and much more and leads to the rest of Decentraland easily.  I understand there maybe some strong attachment to Gensis Plaza, however like everything there needs to be some changes made to make the experience better.  First impressions are everything.

Qualified Voting:** Generate a verification -based on criteria to be defined- of community members qualified to vote on grant proposals.\n\nPros:\n\n*   The community will have more context of the prospect grant to vote, mitigating the passing of grants that are not feasible or that do not comply with their category impact metrics.\n*   There is no cost to the DAO for people who engage in voting for grants.\n\nCons:\n\n*   There is no framework designed yet for this type of contribution, so implementation might take longer than other options.\n*   A scoring system to measure how much weight voters have will be needed.\n\n**4. Grant Feasibility Analysts:**  a group of people selected by the community for a set duration will make a report on the prospect grants proposal page on its technical feasibility, compliance on impact metrics under their category, and then the community will vote as it is now.\nFor implementing this option, the prospect Grant analyzers need to consider factors like feasibility, experience, remuneration, contribution to the DAO, and expected impact. The members should be diverse and qualified, comprising community members with expertise in areas like SDK late stable version, blockchain, marketing, finance, 3D modeling, governance and content curation.\n\nPros:\n\n*   The community will have more context of the prospect grant to vote, mitigating the passing of grants that are not feasible or that do not comply with their category impact metrics.\n*   We would nurture an economy of DAO contributors by remunerating their work\n\nCons:\n\n*   Will have a cost on the DAO\n*   There is no framework designed yet for this type of contribution, so implementation might take longer than other options.\n*   This won’t mitigate whale-passing grants.\n\n**5. Grant Support Squad Analysis:** The Grant Support Squad will make a report on the prospect grants proposal page on its technical feasibility, compliance on impact metrics under their category, and then the community would vote as it does now.  To implement this option, we should amplify the capacity of a squad.\n\nPros:\n\n*   Experience in Decentraland to bring community members in the analysis depending on what’s needed to make the best assessment possible.\n*   Implementation would be faster than others.\n*   The community will have more context of the prospect grant to vote, mitigating the passing of grants that do not comply with their category impact metrics.\n\nCons:\n\n*   Centralization of grants selection and monitoring.\n*   GSS budget will be increased based on the needed capacity.\n*   This won’t mitigate whale-passing grants.\n\n**6. Keep selection of grants as it is:** Maintain the selection process via community voting system, as it is now.\n\nPros:\n\n*   There is no need to implement a new flow.\n\nCons>\n\n*   There is no risk analysis.\n*   The possibility of funding projects that are not aligned with the vision of the DAO\n*   Wasting money and resources from the DAO until revocations in case they are not technically feasible.\n*   More policy over the projects and pressure from the community over the grantees.\n\n- Grants Pre-Selection Committee (GPSC).\n- Grants Selection Committee (GSC)\n- Qualified voting\n- Grant Feasibility Analysis\n- Grant Support Squad Analysis\n- Keep selection of grants as it is\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

It emphasizes the impact on personal and brand identity, accommodating the need for proper capitalization in names and brand titles.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe inability to modify the case of a registered name can lead to inconsistencies with personal or brand identity. This limitation can be particularly significant for brands where specific capitalization is integral to their image. Implementing this change will enhance user experience and brand representation in Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed change involves updating the Decentraland name registration system to allow users to adjust the case of their names. This would include both technical updates and a user-friendly interface for making these adjustments.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nImplementing the ability to change the case of registered names will significantly benefit users and brands in aligning their virtual identity with their real-world representation. This small change could have a considerable impact on user satisfaction and brand perception within Decentraland.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xe945ed0530da54c1af15c6b034be9ef3e6bbe7b1 (OGContraBand)\n\nShould the following $40,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nMost grants are forward-looking future promises of deliveries when the authors have a history of mediocracy.  This grant is to purchase the software license fees for works already done in SDK7.  You may have noticed organic usership is down 90% of users are the 'alter ego' accounts of those existing stake holders desperately trying to pump their rankings up.  This is because Decentraland has lost major attractions such as Monster Hall, Sophia's Robot Apocalypse, OG Contra Band's Blunt Farmer and the Dealer Zone.  I can't speak for Monster Hall, but I was instructed by my boss whom you may know as WokeLadyBoss to delete our farming game because the permanent license wasn't paid.  DCL is starting to be seen as an org that doesn't value devs.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n40,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe945Ed0530Da54C1aF15C6b034Be9Ef3E6BBE7b1\n\n## Email address\n\nmmcontraband2@hotmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nLast week our team delivered the first functioning multi player FPS game - snowball fight at 104,51.   Next we have issued the smart wearable \"Laser Tag Everywhere\" that transforms all parcels in Decentraland (except those that block smart wearables) into a FPS game of laser tag.  All those who have the wearable equipped can blast other players with the laser gun and see sparkling beams fly through the air and explode when hitting the player.  Any objects with collider block the shot.  Each player has 10 hit points and a status bar to show their health status.  A RIP list shows any participants who were unalived.  You can get a feel for the gameplay at 104,51 the wearable is essentially an improved, go-anywhere version of snowball fight or buy  the laser tag wearable everywhere and come to fight us.\n\nIf you have done your homework you'll know Decentraland faced criticism from extremely influential game players and EARNED the title 'dead mall'.  If many new players are air-dropped these laser tag guns they won't be saying that.  Many in Decentraland do not consider DCL to be a game, the problem is the whole rest of the world sees it as a game and they always will.  We need to make sure people are having fun even when a live stream event is not occurring with durable goods.  For those who don't know these high action FPS style games bring a bigger crowd and have a larger market value than all other types of games.  With monster hall game DCL is on life support right now and  the organic value of the land is almost zero.  If you don't recognize this then you're simply uninformed.  No amount of fake accounts can solve this problem, exciting games are the only solution and right now OG Contra Band is the only show in town.\n\nThis grant isn't a promise of future work.  It's to pay the fee and redeploy works already done.  If passed this is the action we will take:\n\nAir drop hundreds of Laser Tag Guns especially to new players\nBring back the farming game, Dealer Zone and FPS portions\nExpand core game with several FPS outposts sprinkle on map as budget affords\nContinue on dynamic loading of FPS game that increases the game-play time.\nLaser Tag 2.0 - gun will play explosion on more objects in scenes.  Visual indicator on player when user is equipped.\\\n6 months of development whatever come - the laser gun can of course be expanded to do teams if that's desired (need to know team selection requirements)\n\nI highly recommend large stake holders to bypass the DAO and air drop MANA and land.  DCL is in the greatest possible danger due to extremely bad and uninformed decision making.  You can see they're admitting to not even visiting those software projects when voting no.  Developers everywhere are seeing this is an ecosystem that doesn't value their industry - expectation of zero per hour pay, no players, no ad potential.  Game players are coming in and seeing a world of Blender objects that are only ads to NFTs, and games that are broke immediately when loading.  Aside from deleted games those games funded most of them are broke we showed documented proof Wilderness is broke immediately upon loaded, KOA was broke on the 1st mission, now broke on 2nd after bug fix.  Exodus needs SDK7 upgrade money when we've already done the work and are running all on SDK7.  Not only do they work, they are the kind of games that have the highest market value and can bring the most players.  This grant is simply to redeploy FPS games that already work.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWork already completed:\n\\*Air drop hundreds of laser tag guns in genesis plaza and elsewhere\n\\*Buy parcel re-deploy blunt farm\n\\*Buy parcel re-deploy robot apocalypse\n\\*re-enable Dealer Zone\nYou can see these games played on OG Contra Band youtube channel\n\n6 months full time dev:\n\\*dynamic loading of obstacles in FPS\n\\*make new configurations and integrate into main farming game\n\\*pay AWS fees\n\\*Laser Tag 2.0 - can be teams based on community feedback, can be changed to snowball fight too\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x858343382132b9ab46c857a7d52fdbafc039f784 (Zino)\n\nThe Decentraland DAO Grants Program has played a pivotal role in fostering the growth of our ecosystem. However, recent insights and the evolving needs of our community necessitate a restructuring to enhance the **quality and impact of funded projects.**\n\nNew restructuring is needed, and the following DRAFTS proposals should clarify the restructuring, but to accomplish the need, we should address the following points:\n\n**Reviewing Grant Request Processes:** Currently, there is no comprehensive assessment of grant applications in terms of quality, feasibility, budget, and alignment with Decentraland's strategic direction. This gap must be addressed to ensure we support projects that genuinely contribute to our ecosystem.\n\n**Refining Grant Categories:** It's crucial to specify the types of projects we fund and the conditions attached to these grants. This refinement should incorporate feedback from the latest Revocations Committee recommendations and the last governance proposal regarding financial reports, ensuring we fund projects that align with our community's values and objectives.\n\n**Defining Budgets for Each Category:** Establishing clear budget limits for each grant category will enable better financial control and allocation efficiency within the DAO. This approach requires revisiting, especially in light of the [rejection of the last proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d5c1c190-362c-11ee-be2d-676a2489bc16) due to disagreements over budget distribution percentages.\n\nYour input is vital in shaping the future of the Decentraland DAO Grants Program. Please share your thoughts and suggestions to help us refine and finalize this proposal. Together, we can ensure that our Grants Program continues to be a pillar for innovation and growth for our community.\n\nIf the poll passes, we will move forward in two stages:\n\n*   **Stage A)** Review Grant Request Process\n*   **Stage B)** Refine Grant Categories and define % budget for each category.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x5117571b0bec00372ce00870ad8e523c704a78b7 (ExodusGBW)\n\nShould the following $100,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to support the expansion and improvement of the Decentraland RPG \"Exodus: Goodbye World\".  Exodus is a multiplayer RPG experience in which players can hone their skills, gather resources, trade with each other, participate in multiplayer events and earn NFTs.\n\nWith this grant, Exodus will support the development of new content as well as place a focus on user acquisition and retention.  Exodus will add skills like potion making and farming while also refining the user experience by porting the game from SDK6 to SDK7, refining the game's scene and designs, and expanding already developed content (like mining and fishing) to support more engaging mechanics and multiplayer interactions.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n100,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x5117571b0BEc00372CE00870ad8E523C704a78b7\n\n## Email address\n\nexodusgbw@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n**Introduction**\n\n\"Exodus: Goodbye World\" (Exodus) is a multiplayer roleplaying game (RPG) aimed towards providing Decentraland users with an engaging as well as rewarding in-world experience.  In Exodus, players have a large choice of skills and activities in which they can gather resources, produces new items, earn experience points, earn in-game currency, earn NFTs, trade, and interact with other players.  Exodus provides hundreds of hours of activities and content, making it a valuable asset for user retention and engagement.\n\nIn 2023, Exodus has reached a net of 8000 all-time accounts created, having a current average of 75 weekly unique users.  During that same time, Exodus released a variety of content and hosted several in-world holiday events.  To give some examples, in 2023 Exodus released: Player-to-Player trading, Multiplayer Item Dropping, Workshopping Skill, Combat Alpha Content, Player Owned Pets, UI Overhauls, Scene Overhauls. As well, Exodus hosted multiplayer in-world events for: Valentines Day, Easter, Business Week, Exodus's Birthday, and Thanksgiving. Exodus’s holiday events always offer a boon to player engagement, with past events averaging in around 500 new accounts created per event and 2000 NFTs given out as gameplay rewards.  We believe that Decentraland needs engaging games like Exodus in order to retain DAU and drive organic growth.  Exodus provides a fun experience where users play can interact with each other for a large number of hours without running out of activities or things to do.  Moreover, consistently hosting interactive holiday events helps retain existing and returning users by providing them with consistent updates and content to look forward to.\n\nCheck out our socials at:  https://X.com/ExodusGBW\n\nPlay at: https://play.decentraland.org/?realm=baldr\\&position=124%2C55\\&island=baldr1u7q\n\n**Enhancements**\n\nExpanding Exodus by introducing new skills and multiplayer mechanics will further refine Exodus' ability to attract new users and retain them.  With this grant, Exodus will focus on a few primary objectives: SDK7 Migration, Potion Making, Farming, and Multiplayer Enhancements.   With SDK6 reaching its end-of-life, we are migrating our already existing code to SDK7.  Given the size of our codebase, this is an extensive task, but will ultimately allow us to integrate many exciting and appealing features that are offered by SDK7.  The introduction of our Potion Making and Farming skills will provide even more hours of content for our players as well as prove our commitment to releasing new content for already existing players.    Lastly, we intend to enhance already existing content, like fishing, mining, and woodcutting, to have multiplayer features - this will help make our content more engaging and interactive.\n\nIn addition to these enhancements, Exodus plans to be a regular and continuing host of in-world events for a variety of holidays.  In the upcoming future, Exodus will be hosting events for Christmas, Valentines Day, and Easter.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur intended content roadmap for the 6 month grant period be as follows.  Note that development of features may overlap based on our development and release cycle.\n\n**SDK 7 Migration**\n\n*   Estimated 3 months timeline.  Goals include migration of: 3D scene asset spawning, NPC dialogs and interactions, UI for inventory, bank, store, equipment, skills, animations for all skills and activities.\n\n**Farming Skill**\n\n*   Estimated 2 months timeline.  Goals include creation of plants and seeds 3D and 2D assets, animations for growing plants, backend programming for skill, front-end integration.\n\n**Potion Making Skill**\n\n*   Estimated 2 month timeline.  Goals include creation of potion 3D and 2D assets, backend programming for skill, front-end integration.\n\n**Pet Cosmetic Skins**\n\n*   Estimate 1 month timeline.  Goals include creation of alternative pet appearances and integrating the ability of player to choose appearance.\n\n**Multiplayer Resource Gathering**\n\n*   Estimated 2 months timeline.  Will make resource gathering a multiplayer experience.  Goals include backend updates to keep track of resources and respawning, front-end updates for triggering animations.\n\nWe will update the community on a monthly basis as to the progress of each feature.  Once completed, we will release the content to be deployed in world within the following month.\\\nWe will host in-world events for:  Christmas, Valentine's Day, Easter.  We will report user engagement metrics in our grant updates for each event.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Although the marketplace has a preview function, it doesn't do justice to how they look inside the world.\n\nIdea is to allow all users, players to dress up & preview the skins they like inside Genesis City. Especially the ones they don't own. Both chains should be included, polygon and eth.\n\nOne minute reset will be enough for the users to make up their mind. After one minute preview feature/function resets and they can no longer wear the wearable.\n\nI believe this will give a nice boost to skins market and display, showcase how the wearable really fit's & looks on the users avatar, rather than guessing how it might look. This will also eliminate many users from purchasing skins they would regret once they equip their avatar in-world.\n\nPlease vote Yes or No\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

We greatly appreciate the community feedback and have come up with a solution which will keep the project going while significantly reducing the costs to the DAO.\nIn this proposal, only Ivan, Lead Developer, is part of the team, and the budget was reduced from $33,600 to $12,156.\n\nHere are our main product updates from the past 6 months:\\\n**Genesis City Map Integration to DCL:**\nWe collaborated with the Foundation on our map's integration to Decentraland. Now you can navigate our map on Decentraland when selecting “Satellite View”.\n![Genesis City Integration](https://i.ibb.co/dcyjrFC/Genesis-City-Integration.jpg)\n\n**Night Mode Layer:**\nYou can explore Genesis City under Night Mode! We will let the image to talk for itself:\n![Night Mode Layer](https://i.ibb.co/5s6pdFF/Night-Mode-Layer.jpg)\n\n**Land Info Modal:**\nWhen you click on a parcel it shows if the land is for sale or rent, at what price, a link to the marketplace and it displays the image from the official client's map.\n\n![Land Info Modal](https://i.ibb.co/rcWxrTw/Land-Info-Modal.jpg)\n\n**Land Sale/Rent Layer:**\nWe created a new layer showing lands available for sale or rent. Clicking on a parcel displays if it's for sale or rent, the listed price, and a direct link to the marketplace.\n![Land Sale/Rent Layer](https://i.ibb.co/3z17Bmy/Land-Sale-Rent-Layer.jpg)\n\n**Enhanced Permalink System:**\nPermalinks now include your selected layers and status so you can share specific map views. E.g. You can now share a link with the Points of Interest layer enabled.\n\n**Easy Reporting:**\nUsers can right-click on any broken coordinate, select \"Report,\" and it will be automatically reported.\n![Easy Reporting](https://i.ibb.co/BqFgTw3/Easy-Reporting.jpg)\n**Adjustments to the “Recent Changes” Layer:**\nWe've tweaked the Recent Changes layer to offer a clearer view. The red markers that show changes are now more transparent so users can still see what is on the land.\n\n**Parcel Image API:**\nWe’ve added an API to retrieve individual parcel images from our Map. Access a specific parcel image by making a GET request to the following URL format:\nhttps://genesis.city/api/v1/land/{x-coordinate},{y-coordinate}.jpg\nFor example: <https://genesis.city/api/v1/land/137,-145.jpg>\n\nFinally, we improved our project's maintenance processes and stability. We paid off some technical debt, fixed bugs, and improved our database backup system.\nWe remain committed to engaging with our community and continue to receive valuable feedback from our users, including requests for new features and improvements.\nWe will request further grants in the future if the community continues to be happy with our work.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe will update the map weekly for 6 months. Once that time has elapsed we will request another grant.\n**Here are some of the projects in our roadmap:**\n\n*   Land ownership layer.\n*   Display weekly events.\n*   See what's nearby a location (eg. display info of events, POIs, etc).\n*   Street view.\n*   Land rating system.\n*   Isometric views.\n*   Allow users to upload photos of lands.\n*   Staff picks.\n*   Layer showing frequency of land updates.\n*   Percentage of land development (user feedback).\n*   Include missing parts of Aetheria (user feedback).\n*   Search bar.\n*   Bookmarks/favorite destinations.\n*   Content age heatmap.\n*   Display the bus routes.\n*   Monthly/weekly treasure hunt.\n*   Geolocated comments.\n*   Historical view of the entire map.\n*   Metamask log-in for displaying user-owned lands.\n*   Livestream of virtual cameras from certain points in DCL.\n*   Design tweaks.\n*   Performance improvements (e.g. Estates Layer optimization).\n\n**We will continue improving the website and mapping script based on this list and future suggestions by our community. Please let us know which features are the most important to you, so we can prioritize accordingly.**\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Motivated by the current limitation in categorization, it seeks to provide creators with a more appropriate platform for their diverse accessory designs, enhancing both creative freedom and user experience.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KlofaKN.png)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, Decentraland's accessory categories are restrictive, compelling creators to add unrelated elements like earrings or tiaras to their designs for categorization purposes. This leads to inconsistencies and hinders creative expression. For instance, an ax accessory is forced into an unrelated category, necessitating the addition of an earring, which is not only irrelevant but also a distraction. Introducing an \"Extra\" category will resolve these issues, allowing creators to classify their accessories more accurately without unnecessary additions.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal includes creating an \"Extra\" category to encompass a wide range of accessories such as halos, belts, wings, swords, and cigars, currently misplaced in categories like earrings or tiaras. \"Extra\" category must have the same requirements as any other accessory. This category will streamline the categorization process, eliminate the need for forced, irrelevant additions, and accurately represent the creators' original design intent.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nImplementation involves updating the categorization system to include the \"Extra\" category and updating documentation.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe introduction of the \"Extra\" category is expected to positively impact the creative community by providing a more flexible and relevant categorization system. It's anticipated to increase creator satisfaction, enhance the diversity of accessory designs, and improve the overall user experience in Decentraland. The proposal's success will be measured by creator feedback, the diversity of new accessories, and user engagement with the new category.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy implementing the \"Extra\" category, Decentraland will foster an environment of enhanced creative expression and user satisfaction. It addresses the current categorization limitations, providing a solution that respects the integrity of accessory designs and aligns with the community's creative aspirations.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The migration process involves significant changes, and without dedicated support, developers may face obstacles, leading to disruptions in project timelines, increased development costs, and potential user experience issues.\n\nMoreover, many projects which have been successful on previous SDK versions, now face the risk of complications that could render them obsolete in the short term. This situation not only jeopardizes the innovation and creativity these projects bring to the metaverse but also raises the specter of wasted funds that the DAO has previously invested in these projects.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nTo address the challenges associated with the SDK7 migration, we propose the creation of a specialized \"Support Team for SDK Migration.\" This team should consist of experienced developers, project managers, and community liaisons dedicated to assisting developers throughout the migration process. The support team should offer:\n\n*   Technical Guidance: Expert advice on navigating the SDK7 features and addressing compatibility issues.\n*   Documentation: Comprehensive guides and documentation to ease the migration process for developers of all skill levels.\n*   Bug Resolution: Quick identification and resolution of SDK7-related bugs to ensure a seamless transition.\n*   Community Engagement: Regular communication and engagement with the Decentraland developer community to address concerns through open sessions, workshops, one-on-one meetings, etc.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nThe primary audience for this support team includes Decentraland developers, both individual and team-based, who are actively working on projects within the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nThe urgency of this proposal is underscored by the imminent [SDK6 sunset](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/sdk6-sunset-strategy/19560). As technology evolves, staying up to date is not just an option but a necessity. By establishing the Support Team for SDK7 Migration, the DAO can proactively address challenges, ensuring a smooth transition for developers and creators.\n\nTimely support will minimize disruptions, maintain developer confidence, and contribute to the overall growth of the ecosystem. The creation of a dedicated Support Team for SDK7 Migration is a strategic investment in the continued success and innovation of Decentraland DAO.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This proposal is launch these two slots early next month December 2023.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nReason? Aside from being way over due, we created the 10,000+ Waifumon linked fairy pets we would like to go in the air pet slot. As we all know we made a 10,000 Decentraland Dinos collection too we will be giving majority out to the community. (Decentraland Land owners, Active DAO voters, Decentraland Creators, Decentraland Players, Decentraland Influencer’s, MANA Holders, Decentraland Wearable Creators, etc) and would like to do this as a gift for the holidays why it is time sensitive.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nhttps://www.aaronleupp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pets-copy.jpg\n\n\n## Specification\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqAS9tqrJXM\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McjyCGQ34m4\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nhttps://www.aaronleupp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pets-copy.jpg\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nhttps://www.aaronleupp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pets-copy.jpg\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe do not mind these pets being the first beta pets for these slots. We do not mind any ascetic faults or hurdles like clipping or glitches. This will be pre-approve and we can fix all errors with updates and patches just like ever other platform in history. We also understand all other pets (non Waifumon Fairy or DCL Dinos) can cause many other unforeseen issues why we don’t mind this being a beta stage and an additional proposal can be made for the rest of pets or one pet wearable proposal at a time, at that point in time with all included things we learn over this period. We also are open to adjusting this proposal to all ideas mentioned below in this stage or next.

    "body": "> by 0x1b35f4d22b2c8bc706bcfcc383a1ca77fb4fc600 (punkpink)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Is it worthwhile to reduce avatar tris and colliders to improve loading speed?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5cf0716f-e664-4c73-b38f-1a4bb094ba44)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal suggests reducing avatar triangles and limiting colliders in buildings to improve Decentraland's loading speed.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nIn anticipation of a possible bull market causing an influx of users, this proposal aims to optimize the performance of Decentraland. By reducing avatar triangles and advocating for fewer colliders in buildings, we aim to improve loading speeds during busy events, thus offering a more fluid and accessible experience for users, in turn making it easier for users to move around without tripping. constantly with elements in the way.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe current challenge faced by Decentraland is the slow loading speed during high-traffic events, which could hamper the platform's capability to handle mass adoption. This proposal addresses the problem by reducing the graphical complexity of avatars and simplifying building designs, potentially leading to significant improvements in platform performance.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal includes the following changes to both the documentation and the hands of the base avatars.\n\n*   Creation of simpler hands with a maximum of 150 each hand (between the two hands 300 tris).\n*   It is not necessary that they have defined fingers.\n*   Implementation of these hands in the base avatars.\n*   Update documentation with corresponding images.\n*   Indicate in the documentation that colliders cannot be used in buildings except on opaque walls, so other elements such as trees, streetlights, minor objects and similar must not have colliders.\n\n**Clarifications:**\n\n*   Creators will be able to continue creating in the Handwear category with the current requirements.\n*   The wearables in the Handwear category that exist in the marketplace will continue to exist and can continue to be marketed.\n*   Users will be able to buy and wear Handwear with the above characteristics, this only affects the base models that have not obtained more elaborate handwear.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile recognizing the potential trade-offs in terms of community sentiment and artistic freedom, this proposal seeks to strike a balance between performance optimization and creative expression. The goal is to make Decentraland more accessible and enjoyable, especially during large-scale events.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Dark Mode Implementation Across Decentraland Platforms/Websites",
    "body": "> by 0x01d1caa915cbb6dea512537fa3e22578e9a5991b (METAWOLF)\n\nShould funds from the DAO Treasury be allocated to finance a new community-led project addressing issues outlined herein?\n\n## Linked Pitch Proposal\n[Dark Mode across more/all Decentraland platforms/sites](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=44cfe370-4463-11ee-ab1f-97157a05bdec)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal supports the implementation of Dark Mode across Decentraland's platforms and websites, addressing the community's widespread request for a night mode setting.\n\nNight Mode has been a long-desired feature within the Decentraland community, like the linked pitch proposal\n\nThe subsequent sections will detail the specific problem statement, technical specifications, and anticipated positive outcomes for the Decentraland community.\n\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe Decentraland community has long expressed a collective desire for the implementation of Dark Mode across platforms and websites. The absence of a night-friendly interface causes visually uncomfortable experience, especially in low-light conditions (evening-night).\n\nWhy we are asking for a Dark Mode?\nFirstly, it can reduce the issue of bad sleep caused by exposure to bright screens in the evening. Dark Mode offers a solution by reducing the emitted light, providing users with a more sleep-friendly environment.\n\nUsers find it beneficial in minimizing eye strain and increasing readability, especially in low-light scenarios. The absence of this feature limits the adaptability of Decentraland's interface\n\n\n## Technical Specification\n\n1.  Platform Compatibility:\n    Ensure compatibility with all major browsers, applications, devices and any other platforms where Decentraland content is accessed.\n\n2.  User Interface Integration:\n    Design an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily toggle between Dark Mode and the standard mode. Implementing a user-friendly setting in account preferences will ensure a smooth transition for users.\n\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1.  Improved Sleep Quality:\n    Users can activate Dark Mode during evening and nighttime sessions, reducing the exposure to bright screens. This promotes better sleep quality\n\n2.  Energy Conservation:\n    Dark Mode contributes to a more energy-efficient digital experience. By lowering screen brightness, power consumption is reduced, aligning with eco-friendly practices and supporting sustainable energy usage.\n\n3.  Reduced Eye Strain:\n    Dark Mode provides users with a visually comfortable experience in low-light conditions. The reduced brightness contribute to decreased eye stress, making it easier for users to engage with Decentraland content for extended periods.\n\n4.  Customization for Personal Preference:\n    Dark Mode introduces a layer of customization, allowing users to personalize their digital experience based on aesthetic preferences. This feature enhances user satisfaction and engagement within the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n5.  Community Well-being:\n    Responding to the community's longstanding request for Dark Mode promotes a sense of community well-being. By actively addressing user preferences, Decentraland demonstrates a commitment to enhancing the overall satisfaction and usability of the platform.\n\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1.  Dark Mode Implementation:\n    Deliver a fully functional Dark Mode feature across Decentraland's core platform, associated websites, and interfaces, ensuring compatibility with major web browsers and mobile applications.\n\n2.  User Interface Design:\n    Provide a visually appealing and intuitive user interface for toggling between Dark Mode and the standard mode. The design should seamlessly integrate with the existing Decentraland interface.\n\n\n## Target Release Quarter\n\n2024 Q2\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xbc02db030361121dd43bbb2fcbcb4f9f98c1dc7d (BoredApe)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Allow the option for building a 5-10 page websites out of DCL Names ](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=97c10d0d-aa5d-4fc2-bc45-6a813bfe2e71)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal is a small adjustment to recently passed Governance Proposal. See blow.\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4112f98e-d360-4a8a-9153-a193976113bd\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nUnder the specifications there is a option for Simple one page Landing pages or Webpages function. I would like this to be extended from one page to 5 or 10 pages for building websites. Considering the average desktop webpage is 2.2 Mb and average mobile webpages are 2 Mb, I say we can allocate some of the 100 Mb given to DCL names for this implementation.\n\nI believe this keeps us innovative and seeing how the digital identities and decentralised domain names have become more relevant in the recent years, this will be a great addition and perhaps an even greater marketing strategy for Decentraland.\n\nShould DCL Names have the option to build 5-10 page websites?\n\nPlease vote; Yes or No\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWeb3 Domain Name System (DNS) is constantly evolving. More users are pushing towards Decentralized Websites. Websites that are not restricted by the rules of ICANN or any government. Another reason why the surge in popularity in decentralized digital identities are gaining adoption, popularity and news/media coverage.\n\nENS DAO has 100's of active grants where the developers further exploring decentralized websites & decentralised identity tools. One platform that recently caught my attention was https://1w3.io/ (ENS DAO Grantee)\n\nThis platform allows ENS users to connect their wallets and design simple websites via templates. Blank template is free, however the other templates require purchasing. Project Dev allows ready to go templates to be sold on L2 matic (polygon) network. Which I thought was a brilliant idea.\n\nYou may be wondering why am I mentioning all this stuff to you. Well it's because the platform is already compatible with Decentraland names. See tweet below.\n\nhttps://x.com/DCLjasonx/status/1727591819326943268?s=20\n\nI believe our talented Dev team are more than capable of spinning up something similar or something even more innovative. Right now only a small amount of the allocated storage space of 100 MB is used and what could be better to put this to a better use.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nEverything should be implemented & managed from inside the Builder.\n\n*   Set Primary Wallet Address\n*   Set Resolver\n*   Upload PFP\n*   Accept all chains including Bitcoin, Solana, Litecoin, Cardano and others\n*   Name to Name messaging function (wallet to wallet)\n*   Website Templates\n*   Website Builder\n*   Visitor Tracker/Counter\n*   Add Space Section where teams, businesses or individuals can advertise their logo, banner or project for a very small fee in MANA\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDecentraland has always been innovative and we should never stop innovating. Just like how we were the first ENS Subdomains, there is nothing stopping us form pursuing further endeavours.\n\nhttps://x.com/evanmoyer_eth/status/1728149300830511538?s=20\n\nI won't be able to answer any questions as someone banned me from one year, so if you have any questions reach out to me on discord or x app.\n\nPlease Vote: Yes or NO\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This proposal aims to complete ChatGPT DCL-Docs with all available information from Decentraland as follows.\n\nChatGPT DCL-Docs will be enhanced with all the official documentation related to the operation and use of Decentraland. This will involve a process of selecting, extracting, processing, and structuring the documentation.\nDuring this procedure, all relevant information for understanding the platform's use will be considered, avoiding data such as calendars, events, wearables, etc., due to their typically ephemeral interest and daily changes, which are not significantly relevant to the knowledge of the platform's operation and could negatively interfere with some model responses.\n\nThe following websites will be used as entry points to access all published information and their internal links, in other words, relevant information from all sections and subsections of these URLs will be extracted:\n\nhttps://decentraland.org\n\nhttps://github.com/decentraland\n\nhttps://github.com/decentraland-scenes\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/decentralanddao\n\nThis will obviously include sections like Docs, Forum, Blog, and the rest of the sections and subsections of these websites.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XNe0uoz.png)\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n\n*   Currently, only ChatGPT Plus users have access to special functions such as Advanced Data Analysis and Browsing. This limits the current chat's reach to these users.\n*   Link to ChatGPT DCL-Docs: https://chat.openai.com/g/g-O6MHZQtbo-dcl-docs\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**1 - Documentation Selection:**\n\n*   Identify and select relevant official documentation on Decentraland's websites (decentraland.org, GitHub, linktr.ee/decentralanddao).\n*   Focus on information about the operation and use of Decentraland.\n\n**2. Data Extraction:**\n\n*   Gather data from all relevant sections and subsections of the mentioned sites.\n*   Avoid ephemeral information such as calendars, events, wearables and others.\n\n**3. Processing:**\n\n*   Organize and structure the information collected to make it easier for ChatGPT to access and understand.\n\n**4. Integration into ChatGPT DCL-Docs:**\n\n*   Incorporate the structured documentation into the ChatGPT DCL-Docs system.\n*   Conduct tests to ensure functionality and accuracy of responses.\n\n**5. Launch:**\n\n*   Launch the updated version of ChatGPT DCL-Docs.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This proposal is launch these two slots early next month December 2023.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nReason? Aside from being way over due, we created the 10,000+ Waifumon linked fairy pets we would like to go in the air pet slot. As we all know we made a 10,000 Decentraland Dinos collection too we will be giving majority out to the community. (Decentraland Land owners, Active DAO voters, Decentraland Creators, Decentraland Players, Decentraland Influencer’s, MANA Holders, Decentraland Wearable Creators, etc) and would like to do this as a gift for the holidays why it is time sensitive.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nhttps://www.aaronleupp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pets-copy.jpg\n\n\n## Specification\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqAS9tqrJXM\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McjyCGQ34m4\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe do not mind these pets being the first beta pets for these slots. We do not mind any ascetic faults or hurdles like clipping or glitches. This will be pre-approve and we can fix all errors with updates and patches just like ever other platform in history. We also understand all other pets (non Waifumon Fairy or DCL Dinos) can cause many other unforeseen issues why we don’t mind this being a beta stage and an additional proposal can be made for the rest of pets or one pet wearable proposal at a time, at that point in time with all included things we learn over this period. We also are open to adjusting this proposal to all ideas mentioned below in this stage or next.

This permits ease of access similarly to how you would grant operator rights to an individual for your parcel in Genesis City, which you can add teammates to assist with building your scene, making modifications, updating the m3u8 link for livestreaming purpose, as well as other events. In addition, this enhancement will further empower individuals, creators, and teams by bypassing the knowledge gap that may exist with the technical expertise to grant operator rights through the CLI.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDecentraland Worlds is a great entry tool to permit users who may not have land in Genesis City to develop and deploy unique builds in their respective DCL name they may purchase. Although, an individual can deploy the build via Builder and coordinate with a dev to develop a scene and deploy it- this method may not always be ideal especially in the instance when you have a distributed staff across the world. By granting operator rights to deploy on your Decentraland Worlds, it would allow ample opportunity to collaborate, increase work efficiency, and save time deploying various scenes in Decentraland Worlds.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAdd a similar feature or option which permits users in the builder to grant operator rights in Decentraland Worlds, as you have currently with granting operator rights to your parcel.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nBy enacting this governance proposal, it will provide an opportunity to increase work efficiency, save time, and provide collaboration with builders or teammates in deploying scenes to Decentraland Worlds without the need of technical information such as granting operator rights through CLI. Below are a few impacts that may occur by enacting this proposal:\n\n*   Boost workflow efficiency\n*   Reduce time expenditure\n*   Enhance collaboration\n*   Expand usage of decentraland worlds\n*   Potentially spike parcel sales in genesis city\n*   Possible increase sales of decentraland names\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n**Integration Difficulty – Low**\n\nBased on the feedback received on Canny, this was a feature that was scheduled to deploy in Q3. However, I suspect other features being prioritized with a greater precedence in the product backlog, this feature may have been a huge priority for Q3 at the time. The options already exist through the builder UI to grant operator rights to a parcel. Integrating CLI to grant operator rights into Decentraland Worlds may not be a heavy lift for the team. Below you can find the information regarding the request submitted July 10, 2023.\n\n*   https://decentraland.canny.io/worlds/p/enable-operator-rights-decentraland-worlds\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf the governance proposal is approved, I foresee it permitting ease of access to community members to collaborate with teammates or builders and increase work efficiency to build unique scenes into Decentraland Worlds. This will ultimately save time and decrease the knowledge gap that may exist by granting operator rights to individuals through CLI.

    "body": "> by 0xaea2d43b9d206be05de7d24b3fa5c28fa05a43e4 (2lanvip)\n\nHi everyone,\n\nDo you think we need more functions for players to interact with each other beyond just emotions, chatting, and talking?\n\nConsidering that, I have some ideas and would like our community to discuss them.\n\nFirstly, our players need a space to express themselves. They can create statuses and upload images. They will have a limited number of statuses and images they can create, based on their assets (MANA token, name, and Land). With these additions, Decentraland can become even more interesting, allowing people to connect online and get to know each other.\n\nSecondly, when players click on another player, they can choose an action for that player (rather than just view their profile for now). The action can be an attack or a kiss, among other options. You can attack someone you hate, just like in normal life, and you can also kiss someone you love (of course, you need acceptance from the other player to kiss). Each player will have a health value (for example, 100 health), and if they engage in a fight, they will lose health. If their health drops below 50, the character's eyes will be bruised from the fight. If it falls below 20, the player will be lying on the floor and unable to stand up. They will need time to recover their health or can choose to buy some food to expedite the recovery process.\n\nWhat do you think about the above ideas? Let's discuss them together.\n\nThis is the first time I have created a proposal, hopefully, it is in the right format.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The Squad has 3 key objectives:\n\n1.  to analyze concerns from grantees and help recover funds if grants  need to be revoked;\n\n2.  to provide support through the entire grant to drive grantees to success;\n\n3.  to collaborate in the creation of processes, improvements, and transparency in the grants program.\n\nBased on the comments on the first version of this renewal, the budget was reduced by 35%: hourly rates for the team were reduced, advisor hours were cut by 50%, and the work hours for the rest of the team were reduced by 18% (non-fundamental tasks were cut).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n61,500 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n5 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x658497d7681e4Fb18C65AbD5Ce066A1e3082c1e5\n\n## Email address\n\npalewin@decentraland.org\n\n## Description\n\nSince Jun22, the Squad has worked with more than 190 grantees. We onboard them and provide support along the way. The team participated in governance processes updating the grants program, developed a grants landing page, published articles to showcase grants, provided transparency in public roadmaps, launched initiatives such as Testing Sessions, sent welcome kits to strengthen DCL brand awareness, and published a Manual of Operations. We have also created a Revocations Committee (RC), and so far we have recovered  $433.778 DAI since this squad was created.\n\n**The GSS has been active and working under 3 main goals:**\n\n**1) For taking care of DAO Treasury**: [$433.778 has been recovered](https://www.notion.so/dcl-dao/edfd964a496942d4befa74d22f4ae26d?v=177d8ed6010f4efd9e96f8f14e7cf5a3\\&pvs=4).\nBefore establishing the RC, were our squad revoked vesting contracts based on gather information, engaging with the grantee, and seeking inputs from advisors to confirm or refute our findings. This approach served as a double-check on the information available. After nearly a year of following this procedure, our team and the community began to recognize that it concentrated a significant amount of power within a single entity. As a response to this concern, the RC was established through a governance proposal. Its purpose was to review our recommendations and allow grantees to engage with an impartial third party, thus ensuring a more fair and transparent process. In this stage, funds related to 8 projects were revoked or recovered, totaling $291,330 (all made possible thanks to investigations or interventions by the GSS) and 13 cases were dismissed.\n\n**2) For supporting grantees**, we have onboarded 100% of the grantees that entered the Program. On our last renewal, while providing more than **784 hours of support**, we shipped more than 45 onboarding kits to raise brand awareness. Since the squad was created, we have solved more than **128 problems/requests** to lead grants to success. So far, we have also produced **20 articles**, published in the DCL Blog about the work our grantees are doing. More recently we have launched **Testing Sessions**, to give the grantees a space to demo their projects and get feedback. So far we have **hosted 27 sessions**.\n\n**3) For fostering transparency & accountability**, we have launched Public Roadmaps, to make a follow up on grants milestones and impact metrics to 100% of the projects (Grants' Framework 2023). We are proud of having built a grants program with community input, with 16 step-by-step guides to provide transparency about our work: [Grant Support Squad’s manual of operations](https://dcl-dao.notion.site/Grant-Support-Squad-Documentation-bc14cb2ffc0c4df18302bcffc6b60b2f). We've also created the [DAO Grants Github REPO](https://github.com/Decentraland-DAO/grants) to compile all the available codes from open sourced grants.\n\nAnd to make overall updates and changes to the grants program, we have published 11 governance proposals,  and have done 9 pull requests made into docs.decentraland.org to update the Grants Program documentation. We have written security recommendations, and a sensitive data handling policy and we created the [Grants Program Landing Page](https://dao.decentraland.org/grants/) .\n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P0TNgMW15zxQupKUVQUmYKTBNIzAn5g929kRuLInc4Q/edit?usp=sharing)  you can see our financial report (Jun to Nov23). It continues in comments.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur work is a continuous effort of support, guidance, analysis, and accountability for grants projects, along with the ongoing effort to improve the Grants Program. That is why our roadmap includes the daily tasks we perform in an ongoing process.  With the spirit of making our processes open, we have published a [Grant Support Squad’s manual of operations](https://dcl-dao.notion.site/Grant-Support-Squad-Documentation-bc14cb2ffc0c4df18302bcffc6b60b2f) in which you can find the description of the processes.\n\n**1) Take care of DAO Grants Treasury**\n\n*   Analyze and elevate cases to the Revocations Committee provide support  with meetings, advice, and contacts.\n*   Report on funds recovered.\n*   Collaborate with bidding and tendering process\n\n**2) Support Grant Projects**\n\n*   Periodic Follow-up with grantees to identify problems and requests, audit the grant projects with onboardings, updating roadmaps, monthly calls and facilitating contacts.\n*   Analyze problems and requests, identify and solve them.\n*   Ensure the accessibility of information about the grants program and promoting grants work on blogposts.\n\n**3) Foster Transparency and accountability**\n\n*   Write a status update monthly on grantees public roadmap, and provide spaces to share their work and gather feedback with Testing Sessions and Townhalls.\n*   Provide  information about the accountability of grants, by publishing concerns raised, and analyzing the cases.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Atlas Analytics - Open Sourcing the Platform for the Community",
    "body": "> by 0xe400a85a6169bd8be439bb0dc9eac81f19f26843 (howieDoin)\n\nShould the following $150,000 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Atlas Corporation has worked with clients in the ecosystem for 3 years now, so we’ve come to recognize the importance of data to our clients. No matter what you’re doing in the metaverse, KPIs and feedback is crucial to understanding the success of your initiatives. We’ve provided Atlas Analytics as a platform and much of the community uses it today - trust us, we know. As we believe the platform is critical to the success of Decentraland, we want to take the first step toward making this a sustainable offering.\n\nWe are seeking funding to continue to provide the Atlas Analytics service for a year, provide enhancements to the product, and open source the code to reduce dependency on the Atlas Corporation going forward.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n150,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n12 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe64581F067Cfdce58657E3c0F58175e638C30f2B\n\n## Email address\n\nhowie@atlascorp.io\n\n## Description\n\nAtlas Analytics, available [here](http://analytics-app.atlascorp.io) is integrated with a scene to collect data directly from in world, and is fundamentally different from the other public data feeds that are provided. Builders can customize their own data points they want to collect, and get more granular feedback that can be visualized. The data obtained can shed insights into user demographics, a user’s technology, and helpful information to assist in debugging scenes. Atlas Analytics often catches data and users that data sources dependent on Catalyst Nodes do not, and can paint a more complete picture of user traffic in one’s virtual world.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are currently the only provider of such a service in most of the metaverse. Other platforms, such as Roblox, offer these services to their builders and we believe Decentraland needs to retain similar offerings to remain competitive.\n\nLast week we reached out to @Yemel to discuss this topic, and he agreed on the value the platform provides the community. The Foundation is not currently planning on building such a service; any analytics collected today are in support of Foundation engineering teams to improve the product and not at providing metrics and KPIs for users.\n\nOne of the goals of this project is to make this product more sustainable; we don’t want to be reaching out to the DAO for more funding in perpetuity. Instead, we think of the DAO more as a government - spending the equivalent of your “taxes” on initiatives that add value to a community but where capitalism may fail to deliver because of high barriers to entry. The local Mom n’ Pop shop may not have the ability to finance the interstate highway that would increase traffic to their destination. An individual is not going to pioneer a space program (and even when a billionaire does build their own rocket ships they are often still heavily subsidized by the local government).\n\nWe also have never, and will continue to never sell any user data. We do not consider that a viable path to profitability as it compromises the values and ethics of the community.\n\nThis grant seeks to accomplish the following:\n\n*   Open source the code, making it the property of the community. Anyone will be able to take the code and run the platform.\n*   Operate the service for another year. While the code will be open source, to operate at the scale of all of Decentraland it currently requires $5k/month of infrastructure and is expected to grow over the course of the year with increased adoption and usage.\n*   Enhance the product, alongside the community publishing out in the open, to include:\n*   Worlds analytics\n*   Official support for SDK 7\n*   Additional content and tutorials to help new creators onboard and understand the full breadth of capabilities.\n*   Running focus groups to determine how to paywall to make the solution more sustainable, and provide the highest impact new features for the community\n*   Bringing the platform in line with other metaverse analytics offerings so that Decentraland can remain competitive\n\nTo express their commitment to the above, Yemel has pledged that the foundation will become an “enterprise” client, and will be supplementing the funds contributed by the DAO.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nAtlas CORP has a long history of delivering open source code for the DAO, and as such can provide the following roadmap targets:\n\n**Product Sustainability**:\n\n*   Code Open Sourced and available to the community (as soon as possible)\n*   Focus group defined and assembled to discuss monetizing the solution now that the DAO is the owner.\n*   Financial projections assembled to determine future funding requirements (e.g. growth of infrastructure footprint, subsidy from paying clients).\n\n**Stability Enhancements and Upgrades**:\n\n*   NPM library installation\n*   Worlds analytics\n*   Support for SDK7\n*   Infrastructure overhaul to protect against DDOS attacks, move to a more distributed, scalable architecture as usage increases\n\n**Feature Roadmap**:\n\nImplement the feature roadmap as determined by the focus group which may include previously brainstormed functions such as:\n\n*   User history in a scene with user path through the map\n*   More precise heat maps\n*   Searchable scene directories\n*   User profile information deep dive\n*   Airdropping helper tools from visiting user lists\n*   Anti-phasing / anti-cheating dashboards and reporting\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should the \"Extra\" category be added as another category of accessories?",
    "body": "> by 0x1b35f4d22b2c8bc706bcfcc383a1ca77fb4fc600 (punkpink)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should the \"Extra\" category be added as another category of accessories?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a0d86f2d-0b4b-47e0-a35a-85b59bf2a6ed)\n\n## Summary\n\nProposal for the addition of an \"Extra\" category in Decentraland to enhance creative freedom in accessory design.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce a new \"Extra\" category in Decentraland for avatar accessories. Motivated by the current limitation in categorization, it seeks to provide creators with a more appropriate platform for their diverse accessory designs, enhancing both creative freedom and user experience.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KlofaKN.png)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, Decentraland's accessory categories are restrictive, compelling creators to add unrelated elements like earrings or tiaras to their designs for categorization purposes. This leads to inconsistencies and hinders creative expression. For instance, an ax accessory is forced into an unrelated category, necessitating the addition of an earring, which is not only irrelevant but also a distraction. Introducing an \"Extra\" category will resolve these issues, allowing creators to classify their accessories more accurately without unnecessary additions.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal includes creating an \"Extra\" category to encompass a wide range of accessories such as halos, belts, wings, swords, and cigars, currently misplaced in categories like earrings or tiaras. This category will streamline the categorization process, eliminate the need for forced, irrelevant additions, and accurately represent the creators' original design intent.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy implementing the \"Extra\" category, Decentraland will foster an environment of enhanced creative expression and user satisfaction. It addresses the current categorization limitations, providing a solution that respects the integrity of accessory designs and aligns with the community's creative aspirations.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should the upper body of the marketplace avatar be updated?",
    "body": "> by 0x1b35f4d22b2c8bc706bcfcc383a1ca77fb4fc600 (punkpink)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Should the upper body of the marketplace avatar be updated?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=68c2e5a0-b15f-4fe9-a072-f1981a0db518)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal suggests updating the upper body of the marketplace avatar to ensure compatibility with the new Handwear category.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe current marketplace avatar, visible when not logged in, does not reflect recent updates to include a Handwear category. This omission results in visual distortions in the Handwear area. The proposed update aims to rectify this by adapting the avatar's upper body for seamless integration with Handwear items, enhancing user experience and marketplace consistency.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bvoDEQr.png)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe introduction of the Handwear category in Decentraland's marketplace represents a significant step forward in avatar customization. However, the existing sample marketplace avatar, which is displayed to users who are not logged in, has not been updated to accommodate this new category. This oversight leads to a notable distortion in the Handwear area, negatively impacting the user's experience and potentially hindering the accurate representation of Handwear items. Updating the avatar's upper body is essential to maintain visual integrity, ensure a consistent user experience, and fully showcase the capabilities of the new Handwear category.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed update involves redesigning the upper body of the sample marketplace avatar to align with the dimensions and specifications of the Handwear category.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\n**Enhanced user experience:** Users enjoy a more accurate and engaging display with Handwear items\n\n**Increased marketplace consistency:** Uniformity across logged-in and not-logged-in avatars, improving overall marketplace aesthetics.\n\n**Boost in Handwear category:** Enhanced display leading to potentially increased interest and sales in the Handwear category.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n**Design revision:** The person in charge of this task will have to recondition the design of the upper body so that it is compatible with the Handwear category.\n\n**Finalization and testing:** Finalize the avatar design and conduct thorough testing to ensure seamless integration with existing and future Handwear items.\n\n**Deployment:** Roll out the updated avatar on the marketplace, ensuring all users, logged in or not, see the enhanced version.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUpdating the marketplace avatar's upper body is a necessary step to align with the advancements in Decentraland's avatar customization options. By addressing the current visual distortion in the Handwear category, this proposal aims to enhance the overall user experience, ensure consistency across the marketplace, and showcase the full potential of avatar customization in Decentraland.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

I'm offering 37% off software development services to expand OG Contra Band Farm Game.  This is the fun game where you blast animated robots, grow special farm herbs and drive around in a car to sell them for in-game money.  The game features the first-ever full-avatar leader-board where the world champions avatars are displayed.\n\nThe grant will include the FPS portions that popular youtubers complain the Decentraland 'game' does not have enough of.  Not only will the existing robot battle zone be expanded a whole new world will be created featuring new opponents.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n25,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n4 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe945Ed0530Da54C1aF15C6b034Be9Ef3E6BBE7b1\n\n## Email address\n\nmmcontraband2@hotmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nIf you've watched any critics they come into Decentraland and don't have enough fun compared to other 'games'.  This is why I created OG Contra Band farm.   It's imperative to get more quality games in DCL to attract and entertain visitors for the protection of land value, advertising power and Mana price.\n\nSecondly the funding allows me to focus my time on Decentraland.  I will be analyzing the platform code looking for improvements in scene loading technique.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n\\--Expand AI Robot Apocalypse component (104,51) with dynamic placement of robots, walls and crates to create multiple levels.\n\\--Upgrade robots to SDK 7\n\\--Build out seed and fertilizer shop world. Player battles new opponents to get to the shop where they can trade in-game money for seed strains and fertilizers.\n\\--Bug fix in-memory cross-parcel caching of values\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This proposal is launch these two slots early next month December 2023.\n\nReason? Aside from being way over due, we created the 10,000+ Waifumon linked fairy pets we would like to go in the air pet slot. As we all know we made a 10,000 Decentraland Dinos collection too we will be giving majority out to the community. (Decentraland Land owners, Active DAO voters, Decentraland Creators, Decentraland Players, Decentraland Influencer's, MANA Holders, Decentraland Wearable Creators, etc) and would like to do this as a gift for the holidays why it is time sensitive.\n\nhttp://www.aaronleupp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pets-copy.jpg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqAS9tqrJXM\nhttps://youtu.be/McjyCGQ34m4\n\nWe do not mind these pets being the first beta pets for these slots. We do not mind any ascetic faults or hurdles like clipping or glitches. This will be pre-approve and we can fix all errors with updates and patches just like ever other platform in history. We also understand all other pets (non Waifumon Fairy or DCL Dinos) can cause many other unforeseen issues why we don't mind this being a beta stage and an additional proposal can be made for the rest of pets or one pet wearable proposal at a time, at that point in time with all included things we learn over this period.

I feel too much power may be given to those in control.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nIt is unclear at this stage who runs the DCL forum. For almost a year now almost all my messages get flagged and removed (deleted) by the system without any valid reason or explanation. I feel I've been personally targeted & attacked by a group of individuals and even some who are part of the Foundation & Dao.\n\nHow can you ban someone from the forum for one year without any form of community voting? This does not fit what Decentraland is about. Everyone should feel free to make a comment, express their feelings & opinions. Saying there are only two genders should not get a forum member, especially an active old time platform contributor, user banned from the forum for one year.  We need a solution for this problem, not dictatorship. Blocking & banning users only because they share & believe views that are opposite to your beliefs is a sign of hypocrisy, low self esteem and a dictatorship.  Therefore such actions do not align well with what Decentraland has built over the years.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe core of the problem is Foundation & DAO have given too much power to whoever is in control of the forum. They're taking advantage of their positions by acting in a misdemeanour behaviour and knowingly, inflicting harm to platform.\n\nThere has to be clear policies & guidelines on the Forum. We, as users deserve the right to know who is currently working for the forum. We need to know if they're involved with DAO/Foundation and establish if there is a conflict of interest as I believe there is a conflict of interest, having the same person employed over all 3 entities.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nI ask for the community to be able to vote & select the forum workers & moderator and these positions to be renewed every 6 months by bring ing in new people. This is why we have the DAO for right?\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI ask that my forum account be restored in the meantime.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x1b35f4d22b2c8bc706bcfcc383a1ca77fb4fc600 (punkpink)\n\nI have been working on a ChatGPT specialized in Decentraland documentation. Although it's useful for quick queries, it lacks much other information from Decentraland that could enrich it, such as DAO proposals, forum posts, GitHub data, and other sites.\n\nTwo possible paths are presented:\n\n**Option 1**\n\nImprove ChatGPT DCL-Docs with proper instructions to extract information through URLs related to the platform. This can be relatively quick and easy, but while the information extraction from docs.decentraland.org was successful, it couldn't properly extract it from sites like Notion. This could lead to the failure to extract information from other places.\n\n*   Advantage: Quick and easy improvement.\n*   Challenge: Issues extracting data from sites like Notion.\n*   Disadvantage: Incomplete information.\n*   Estimated Cost: $480.\n\n**Option 2**\n\nThis would be an appropriate way for ChatGPT DCL-Docs to function properly and provide precise answers from all the currently available information. However, it requires a more complex process that, although it can be automated at times, will not always be so and will require manual intervention.\n\n*   Advantage: Complete and precise answers from all documentation.\n*   Challenge: Collection, extraction, and processing of information, a complex process with possible manual intervention.\n*   Disadvantage: Higher cost.\n*   Estimated Cost: $3,200.\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n\n*   Currently, only ChatGPT Plus users have access to special functions such as Advanced Data Analysis and Browsing.

While currently visible in the marketplace, emojis are not consistently displayed in-world, creating a discrepancy. By ensuring their visibility across all platforms, this proposal aims to enhance user experience and maintain consistency.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HH3IZ1n.png)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe issue lies in the inconsistency of emoji display, where their visibility varies between the marketplace and in-world. This discrepancy might seem minor but holds significance for users who rely on emojis for personal expression or brand identification within the Decentraland virtual environment. Ensuring a uniform display of emojis in wearables and emotes across all platforms will enrich the user experience, fostering a more cohesive and expressive virtual world.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal advocates for an update or modification within the Decentraland platform to ensure that emojis used in the names of wearables and emotes are consistently displayed in the marketplace as well as in the in-world interface. The proposed policy would standardize the display of emojis, ensuring that users' chosen emojis are visible and accurately represented regardless of the platform they are viewed on.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe uniform display of emojis across Decentraland will enhance user experience by fostering a more cohesive and expressive virtual environment. This improvement is expected to increase user satisfaction and engagement, as it aligns with their need for personal expression and brand identification.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe person dedicated to these issues can carry out the most appropriate procedure to successfully complete this implementation.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe consistent display of emojis within wearables and emotes in Decentraland is crucial for user expression and identification. By addressing the discrepancy between marketplace visibility and in-world display, this proposal aims to enhance user experience, creating a more unified and expressive virtual environment for all users.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Here are our main updates:\n\n**Genesis City Map Integration to DCL:**\n\nWe collaborated with the Foundation on our map's integration to Decentraland. Now you can navigate our map on Decentraland when selecting “Satellite View”.\n\n![Genesis City Integration](https://i.ibb.co/dcyjrFC/Genesis-City-Integration.jpg)\n\n**Night Mode Layer:**\n\nYou can explore Genesis City under Night Mode! We will let the image to talk for itself:\n\n![Night Mode Layer](https://i.ibb.co/5s6pdFF/Night-Mode-Layer.jpg)\n\n**Land Info Modal:**\n\nWhen you click on a parcel it shows if the land is for sale or rent, at what price, a link to the marketplace and it displays the image from the official client's map.\n\n![Land Info Modal](https://i.ibb.co/rcWxrTw/Land-Info-Modal.jpg)\n\n**Land Sale/Rent Layer:**\n\nWe created a new layer showing lands available for sale or rent. Clicking on a parcel displays if it's for sale or rent, the listed price, and a direct link to the marketplace.\n\n![Land Sale/Rent Layer](https://i.ibb.co/3z17Bmy/Land-Sale-Rent-Layer.jpg)\n\n**Enhanced Permalink System:**\n\nPermalinks now include your selected layers and status so you can share specific map views. E.g. You can now share a link with the Points of Interest layer enabled.\n\n**Easy Reporting:**\n\nUsers can right-click on any broken coordinate, select \"Report,\" and it will be automatically reported.\n\n![Easy Reporting](https://i.ibb.co/BqFgTw3/Easy-Reporting.jpg)\n\n**Adjustments to the “Recent Changes” Layer:**\n\nWe've tweaked the “Recent Changes” layer to offer a clearer view. The red markers that show changes are now more transparent so users can still see what is on the land.\n\nFinally, we improved our project's maintenance processes and stability. We paid off some technical debt, fixed bugs, and improved our database backup system.\n\nWe remain committed to engaging with our community and continue to receive valuable feedback from our users, including requests for new features and improvements.\n\nWe will request further grants in the future if the community continues to be happy with our work.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe will update the map weekly for 6 months. Once that time has elapsed we will request another grant.\n\n**Here are some of the projects in our roadmap:**\n\n*   Land ownership layer.\n*   Display weekly events.\n*   See what's nearby a location (eg. display info of events, POIs, etc).\n*   Street view.\n*   Land rating system.\n*   Isometric views.\n*   Allow users to upload photos of lands.\n*   Staff picks.\n*   Layer showing frequency of land updates.\n*   Percentage of land development (user feedback).\n*   Include missing parts of Aetheria (user feedback).\n*   Display the bus routes.\n*   Monthly/weekly treasure hunt.\n*   Search bar.\n*   Bookmarks/favorite destinations.\n*   Content age heatmap.\n*   Geolocated comments.\n*   Historical view of the entire map.\n*   Metamask log-in for displaying user-owned lands.\n*   Livestream of virtual cameras from certain points in DCL.\n*   Design tweaks.\n*   Performance improvements (e.g. Estates Layer optimization).\n\n**We will continue improving the website and mapping script based on this list and future suggestions by our community.

    "body": "> by 0x2684a202a374d87bb321a744482b89bf6deaf8bd (FriskyBumbleBee)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Enable Operator Rights option in the Builder UI for Decentraland Worlds](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=575c2ecf-dd72-433e-99cb-37e77fddcff7)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to enable operator rights for DCL Worlds through the Builder UI, and provide a means to collaborate with other users in deploying scenes with DCL names purchased without the technical expertise to deploy it through CLI.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nImplementing the proposed feature to the builder UI would provide ample opportunity for individuals to collaborate with each other in deploying unique scenes to Decentraland Worlds. This permits ease of access similarly to how you would grant operator rights to an individual for your parcel in Genesis City, which you can add teammates to assist with building your scene, making modifications, updating the m3u8 link for livestreaming purpose, as well as other events. In addition, this enhancement will further empower individuals, creators, and teams by bypassing the knowledge gap that may exist with the technical expertise to grant operator rights through the CLI.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDecentraland Worlds is a great entry tool to permit users who may not have land in Genesis City to develop and deploy unique builds in their respective DCL name they may purchase. Although, an individual can deploy the build via Builder and coordinate with a dev to develop a scene and deploy it- this method may not always be ideal especially in the instance when you have a distributed staff across the world. By granting operator rights to deploy on your Decentraland Worlds, it would allow ample opportunity to collaborate, increase work efficiency, and save time deploying various scenes in Decentraland Worlds.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAdd a similar feature or option which permits users in the builder to grant operator rights in Decentraland Worlds, as you have currently with granting operator rights to your parcel.\n\nBy enacting this governance proposal, it will provide an opportunity to increase work efficiency, save time, and provide collaboration with builders or teammates in deploying scenes to Decentraland Worlds without the need of technical information such as granting operator rights through CLI. Below are a few impacts that may occur by enacting this proposal:\n\n*   Boost workflow efficiency\n*   Reduce time expenditure\n*   Enhance collaboration\n*   Expand usage of decentraland worlds\n*   Potentially spike parcel sales in genesis city\n*   Possible increase sales of decentraland names\n\n**Integration Difficulty – Low**\n\nBased on the feedback received on Canny, this was a feature that was scheduled to deploy in Q3. However, I suspect other features being prioritized with a greater precedence in the product backlog, this feature may have been a huge priority for Q3 at the time. The options already exist through the builder UI to grant operator rights to a parcel. Integrating CLI to grant operator rights into Decentraland Worlds may not be a heavy lift for the team. Below you can find the information regarding the request submitted July 10, 2023.\n\n*   https://decentraland.canny.io/worlds/p/enable-operator-rights-decentraland-worlds\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf the governance proposal is approved, I foresee it permitting ease of access to community members to collaborate with teammates or builders and increase work efficiency to build unique scenes into Decentraland Worlds. This will ultimately save time and decrease the knowledge gap that may exist by granting operator rights to individuals through CLI. Please provide any feedback and thank you for your time.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should the upper body of the marketplace avatar be updated?",
    "body": "> by 0x1b35f4d22b2c8bc706bcfcc383a1ca77fb4fc600 (punkpink)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should the sample marketplace avatar be updated?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b49814cf-495c-4fcf-b882-1e07eec18a66)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal suggests updating the upper body of the marketplace avatar to ensure compatibility with the new Handwear category.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe current marketplace avatar, visible when not logged in, does not reflect recent updates to include a Handwear category. This omission results in visual distortions in the Handwear area. The proposed update aims to rectify this by adapting the avatar's upper body for seamless integration with Handwear items, enhancing user experience and marketplace consistency.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bvoDEQr.png)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe introduction of the Handwear category in Decentraland's marketplace represents a significant step forward in avatar customization. However, the existing sample marketplace avatar, which is displayed to users who are not logged in, has not been updated to accommodate this new category. This oversight leads to a notable distortion in the Handwear area, negatively impacting the user's experience and potentially hindering the accurate representation of Handwear items. Updating the avatar's upper body is essential to maintain visual integrity, ensure a consistent user experience, and fully showcase the capabilities of the new Handwear category.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed update involves redesigning the upper body of the sample marketplace avatar to align with the dimensions and specifications of the Handwear category.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUpdating the marketplace avatar's upper body is a necessary step to align with the advancements in Decentraland's avatar customization options. By addressing the current visual distortion in the Handwear category, this proposal aims to enhance the overall user experience, ensure consistency across the marketplace, and showcase the full potential of avatar customization in Decentraland.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xbc02db030361121dd43bbb2fcbcb4f9f98c1dc7d (Feisty)\n\nThis one took me a while but I think I finally figured it out.\n\nThere are many associated reasons as to why new (guest) users are not claiming names. One of them being the overall costs involved. Don't think for a second it's only 100 Mana. We now have to approve, authorise, revoke and confirm. On top of all this there a a rising cost of ethereum gas fees. Yesterday I've minted a name for 100 Mana, which at the time was $43. All other costs including gas, revoke, approve, authorise cost me another $30 on top. (you can see it on ethers scan from my transactions)\n\nI don't see how this current model is variable or sustainable in the long run. With the bull market returning to NFT's, Crypto, Web3 & the Metaverse, we can only expect to see higher network gas fees.\n\nMy solution is to lower the name minting to $5 USD in Mana. Say for example if mana is $5, it will only cost 1 mana token to mint a name. So it has to be variable/adjustable according to mana price at that given time.\n\nAll exisiting name owners/holders (if this proposal is accepted) will keep 100 VP.\n\nAll new name owners/holders (if this proposal is accepted) will be awarded 10 VP per name regardless of the price. This is mainly due to;\na) Claiming names for $5 compared to $55\nb) Incentivising new users to claim names and get involved with DCL on a lower scale/budget and encouraging users to participate in the DAO\n\nAs the second largest names holder and someone who claimed names for $500 (when mana was $5) I really believe this is needed.\n\nPlease Vote; Yes or No\n\n- Yes\n- No \n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Is it worthwhile to reduce avatar tris and colliders to improve loading speed?",
    "body": "> by 0x1b35f4d22b2c8bc706bcfcc383a1ca77fb4fc600 (punkpink)\n\n### Description\n\nThere is a possibility of a future bullish market that could attract a large number of new users to Decentraland. We must be aware that Decentraland may not be prepared for massive adoption, primarily because during crowded events, loading speed can be extremely slow, making gameplay sometimes impossible. One potential change to enhance platform loading time could be to reduce the number of triangles in avatars and attempt to limit colliders in upcoming buildings. It is essential to note that these changes may not completely solve the problem but could bring us closer to a faster and more accessible platform for users.\n\nThis plan consists of two points:\n\n**1) Reducing the number of triangles in base avatars by approximately 1,000 triangles**\n\nThe current avatar base hands have 1,200 triangles each, which is a significantly high percentage of triangles for an avatar, and of course relevant if we manage to have 1,000 users in the same scene, since this would be 1.2M triangles. The hands in the base avatar could be replaced with simpler ones. *(NOTE: This change would only apply to the base model; the Handwear category would still exist, and wearables in this category would allow users to retain fingers and perform finger-moving emotes.)*\n\n**2) Advocating in the documentation for buildings to only have colliders on walls (not on glass, objects, NPCs, or anything other than opaque walls):**\n\nThis measure would only take effect in the medium to long term, as existing buildings cannot be modified. This point would involve modifying the documentation to encourage buildings not to contain colliders.\n\n### Drawbacks of these changes\n\n**- Community conflict:** Many creators, including myself, may not appreciate additional limitations that could restrict creativity. Some individuals might see this as an impediment to their artistic freedom, potentially creating conflict.\n\n**- Uncertain impact:** The final impact on loading speed during massive events is unknown.\n\n**- Reduction in quality:** While justifiable, reducing the quality of basic avatars' finger emotes and using simpler hands is still a graphical quality reduction that needs evaluation.\n\n**- Discrimination:** New users or those not acquiring fingered Handwear may feel their avatars are more limited, potentially leading to a sense of injustice.\n\n**- Less appealing to creators:** Increasing limitations on creators could be a barrier for future creators.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI am unsure if this plan is viable, as the potential increase in loading speed may be minimal. If anyone has a better idea, please share it in the comments. The goal of this poll is not only to gauge community sentiment but also to debate what can be done about this issue. I believe comments may be more useful than votes, as this is a complex decision with many nuances. Experienced individuals are encouraged to highlight the pros and cons of this proposal to assess whether it is worth pursuing. I also appreciate input from creators, as these changes may impact our artistic freedom to some extent. If this idea moves forward and no one is willing, I could create the meshes for the base avatar hands, of course for free. Therefore, do you think it's worth reducing avatar triangles and omitting some colliders in buildings to improve loading speed?\n\n- The impact may be significant, and we should continue on this path.\n- The impact may be optimal, and we should delve deeper into this idea.\n- The impact may be minimal, and it is not worth making this change.\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Adjust L1 Wearables Voting Power Allocation for All 6 Collections",
    "body": "> by 0xbc02db030361121dd43bbb2fcbcb4f9f98c1dc7d (Feisty)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[L1 Ethereum Wearables Voting Power Allocation Proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=02129b80-d143-11eb-9861-ebb8fcfd58d2)\n\n## Summary\n\nIt has come to my attention that, L1 Wearables Voting Power from the approved 6 collections are actually quite low.\n\nHere's my proposed VP for L1's\n\n*   Mythic: 2000 VP\n\n\\-Legendary: 200 VP\n\n*   Epic: 20 VP\n\n*   Rare: 10 VP\n\n*   Uncommon: 2 VP\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis is a binding governance proposal calling for the attachment of voting power (VP) to the original six (OG6) official Decentraland Layer One (L1) wearable collections, released in 2019. This includes the following collections: 1) Community Contest; 2) DCL Launch; 3) Exclusive Masks; 4) Halloween 2019; 5) MCH Collection; and 6) Xmas 2019.\n\nThe hope is that this solution meets the demands of wearable stakeholders, and is both accepted by other stakeholders and viewed as technically feasible due to its limited application to only the six (6) first and official Decentraland wearables collections.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal seeks to resolve the issue of wearables VP, which has been a point of contention since passage of the first non-binding poll in June 2022. It aims to provide an implementation pathway that distributes wearable VP in as equitable a way as possible, while mitigating technical blockers. It further fulfills a demand that was made by the community with a relatively strong level of support, equating to nearly 20% of historical VP, however, was not enacted by the DAO committee because there was no clear implementation pathway.\n\nWhile there was no initial promise of VP with purchase of early L1 wearables, assets from the Halloween 2019 collection remain the only officially-sponsored asset in which MANA was spent by community members, burned by the Foundation, and is not associated with any form of VP. The problem with some past solutions proposed by wearable stakeholders to attach VP to ALL L1 wearables is that, a) it is incredibly arduous to implement, particularly when considering distributing VP by rarity of each collection; b) it is somewhat arbitrary in that there is no precedent for such a VP-generating act; and c) In the majority of cases it would in fact be creating double VP in that wearables were purchased in a p2p transaction in which no MANA was burned, so the seller would have received MANA equating to VP and the buyer a wearable equating to VP. As a result of the above, an all encompassing L1 solution is technically impractical and both quantitatively and qualitatively difficult to justify.\n\nThe Halloween 2019 collection, however, was the first wearable collection after the Exclusive Masks beta, and the only collection partially sold by the Decentraland Foundation, raising 1,077,320 MANA in sales. Although subsequent collections in the 2019 wearable offerings were distributed for free or as a reward, this spent MANA, which was removed from the ecosystem, has not received any democratic utility. By attaching VP to these “initial offering” wearable collections (and only to these initial six), which are the foundation of the robust wearables market we see today, this proposal aims to assert wearables as an essential asset class - similar to MANA, LAND, and Names.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAttach voting power, distributed by rarity to the six (6) official Decentraland wearable collections released in 2019. This includes:\n\n*   Community Contest\n*   DCL Launch\n*   Exclusive Masks\n*   Halloween 2019\n*   MCH Collection\n*   Xmas 2019\n\nThere are 48,620 total wearables in these six collections, spread across 7000+ wallets. This equates to nearly 70% of the 71,082 total L1 wearables, which are spread across 10000+ unique wallets.\n\nVP will be distributed according to rarity as follows:\n\nMythic: 2000 VP\n\nLegendary: 200 VP\n\nEpic: 20 VP\n\nRare: 10 VP\n\nUncommon: 2 VP\n\nThere are 644 mythics across 189 unique wallets; 4,249 Legendary across 827 unique wallets; 17,382 Epic across 4,820 unique wallets; and 24,713 rares across 4,126 unique wallets.\n\nIn total this will create 2,732,570 VP. This equates to ~15% of the historically active VP in the DAO, and is less than 2x the amount of MANA spent (and burned) by community members to purchase Halloween 2019 wearables from the Decentraland Foundation.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese six (6) original wearable collections from 2019 are the final group of initial offering assets that have no associated VP. Other assets in this category include MANA, LAND and Names. What unites these assets are the fact that they are tied to either the core Decentraland smart contracts, or were linked to a foundation-led asset sale in which MANA was burned or the assets were distributed freely to early project adopters.\n\nVoting in favor of this proposal is meant to put a close to the question of creating additional voting power assets in the future. This final section of the proposal should be referred to if there are further attempts to use past precedent as an argue for extending VP to additional asset sets or categories.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The target realm is [exodus.town](https://exodus.town).\n\n### Background\n\nIn the chronicles of the Metaverse, Genesis City stands as our first civilization, a beacon of what we can achieve. Its foundations were laid by the ancient Kyllians, pioneers of the digital frontier, those digital titans who first mastered the bytes and blocks of this realm. Their vision gave us a city where sky-piercing spires and boundless creativity became the norm. Yet, as we revel in Genesis City's glory, we must also acknowledge the digital dusk that has crept upon some of its streets.\n\nIt is time to remember the lessons etched into our code by the Kyllians—to innovate, to expand, and sometimes, to fork away from the shadows that loom. We speak of the RobLs and their CartLs, figures that have cast long shadows over our bright beginnings. We speak of the whales, whose depth and breadth sometimes leave little room for the small fish to swim.\n\nBut fear not, for the dawn of Exodus is upon us.\n\n### Logistics\n\n[Exodus Town](https://exodus.town) unfolds in a new realm, where each parcel is a canvas nine times larger than those of Genesis City, offering vast new landscapes for innovation and creativity. In the heart of this realm, time is marked not by the clock but by the daily minting of a new parcel (the TOWN token, akin to Genesis City’s LAND)—available to anyone drawn to its promise and willing to bid.\n\nWith the dawn of each day, the spiral of Exodus Town extends by one parcel, a pattern etched into eternity, ensuring that expansion is not just a phase but a perpetual state of being. Here, the economic lifeblood of the town—the proceeds from these daily parcels—flows undiverted into the [Exodus DAO](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/exodus-town). Governed with transparency and integrity, the DAO is steered by the will of the TOWN token holders, and no one else. In this way, Exodus Town is more than a place; it's a movement, a governance revolution, where every bid fortifies the community and every TOWN token casts a vote for its destiny.\n\n### Call to Action\n\nThis proposal is an invitation: to populate Exodus, to forge a new beginning where every voice is heard, every avatar stands equal, and every TOWN token is a vote for the future.\n\nWe need more than just settlers; we need the best among us. The artists who paint dreams into digital reality. The architects who build more than structures but communities. The jesters who remind us not to take bytes too seriously. And yes, the rebels, who question every line of code just because they can.\n\nLet's fork the past, not the community.\n\nLink: [exodus.town](https://exodus.town)\n\n- I'll sail forth on this odyssey, charting Exodus Town's untold horizons.\n- I'll stay ashore, anchored in the saga of lands known.\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Enable Operator Rights option in the Builder UI for Decentraland Worlds",
    "body": "> by 0x2684a202a374d87bb321a744482b89bf6deaf8bd (FriskyBumbleBee)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to provide an opportunity to enable operator rights for Decentraland Worlds through the Builder UI. By enabling this feature, it would provide a means to collaborate with other users in deploying unique scenes with Decentraland names purchased without the need of technical expertise to deploy it through CLI.\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nAdding this feature to the builder would provide ample opportunity for individuals to collaborate with each other in deploying unique scenes to Decentraland Worlds. This permits ease of access similarly to how you would grant operator rights to an individual for your parcel in Genesis City. Enabling this feature will provide an opportunity for an individual who may not have the technical background to deploy in Worlds without the need to go through the CLI to add operators to their respective worlds.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nDecentraland Worlds is a great entry tool to permit users who may not have land in Genesis City to develop and deploy unique builds in their respective DCL name they may purchase. Although, an individual can deploy the build via Builder and coordinate with a dev to develop a scene and deploy it- this method may not always be ideal especially in the instance when you have a distributed staff across the world. By granting operator rights to deploy on your Decentraland Worlds, it would allow ample opportunity to collaborate, increase work efficiency, and save time deploying various scenes in Decentraland Worlds.\n\n**Specification:**\n\nAdd a similar feature or option which permits users in the builder to grant operator rights in Decentraland Worlds, as you have currently with granting operator rights to your parcel.\n\n**Impacts:**\n\nBy enacting this governance proposal, it will provide an opportunity to increase work efficiency, save time, and provide collaboration with builders or teammates in deploying scenes to Decentraland Worlds without the need of technical information such as granting operator rights through CLI.\n\n**Integration Difficulty – Low**\n\nBased on the feedback received on Canny, this was a feature that was scheduled to deploy in Q3. However, I suspect other features being prioritized with a greater precedence  in the product backlog, this feature may have been a huge priority for Q3 at the time. The options already exist through the builder UI to grant operator rights to a parcel. Integrating CLI to grant operator rights into Decentraland Worlds may not be a heavy lift for the team. Below you can find the information regarding the request submitted July 10, 2023.\n\n*   https://decentraland.canny.io/worlds/p/enable-operator-rights-decentraland-worlds\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf the governance proposal is approved, I foresee it permitting ease of access to community members to collaborate with teammates or builders and increase work efficiency to build unique scenes into Decentraland Worlds. This will ultimately save time and decrease the knowledge gap that may exist with granting operator rights to individuals through CLI. Please provide any feedback, and thank you for your time.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

While currently visible in the marketplace, emojis are not consistently displayed in-world, creating a discrepancy. By ensuring their visibility across all platforms, this proposal aims to enhance user experience and maintain consistency.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HH3IZ1n.png)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe issue lies in the inconsistency of emoji display, where their visibility varies between the marketplace and in-world. This discrepancy might seem minor but holds significance for users who rely on emojis for personal expression or brand identification within the Decentraland virtual environment. Ensuring a uniform display of emojis in wearables and emotes across all platforms will enrich the user experience, fostering a more cohesive and expressive virtual world.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal advocates for an update or modification within the Decentraland platform to ensure that emojis used in the names of wearables and emotes are consistently displayed in the marketplace as well as in the in-world interface. The proposed policy would standardize the display of emojis, ensuring that users' chosen emojis are visible and accurately represented regardless of the platform they are viewed on.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe consistent display of emojis within wearables and emotes in Decentraland is crucial for user expression and identification. By addressing the discrepancy between marketplace visibility and in-world display, this proposal aims to enhance user experience, creating a more unified and expressive virtual environment for all users.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x531aa0845cf473a55bb5bc8cda5e04ea5b27c726 (Fecet)\n\nShould the following $3,000 grant in the Social Media Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe central components of my project are rooted in crafting compelling, community-driven content with a focus on two key areas: the Decentraland platform and the wearables market. Within this project, my primary responsibilities involve copywriting, spearheading community engagement initiatives, and hosting challenges designed to enhance Decentraland's vibrancy. I have deep understanding of Decentraland, great knowledge in marketing communications and graphic designing. Today, I am here with brand new contents and challenges.  \"Affordawear\", \"Guess the Wearable\" challenge, and \"Wearable Wars\". The grant will be for creating these 3 contents on weekly basis, creating new contents alike, as well as continuation of \"Wearable Wednesday\".\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD in MANA\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x531aA0845cF473A55BB5bc8cda5E04Ea5B27C726\n\n## Email address\n\nfecetdcl@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n![Image Banners](https://i.imgur.com/dMLA5q3.png)\n\nAffordawear:\n\nIt is a content series that aims to spotlight the affordable wearables available within Decentraland's marketplace.\nEach \"Affordawear\" post will feature specific wearables item close the marketplace's floor price (I call them penny picks), making it more accessible and enticing to a broader audience within the Decentraland community.\n\nThrough engaging copywriting and visually appealing content, the objective is to support wearable creators, empower community members with knowledge about affordable wearables that can enhance their Decentraland experience.\n\nThe project aims to fulfill the need for affordable and desirable wearables, making them more accessible for community members, including newcomers, and encouraging participation in the wearables market.\n\n![Image Banners](https://i.imgur.com/9JK4xzz.png)\n\nGuess the Wearable:\n\nThese challenges, scheduled on a weekly basis, will be presented to the community with distorted or blurred images of wearables, inviting them to guess the wearables' identities.\n\nParticipants will have the opportunity to win wearable prizes, adding an exciting incentive to participate.\n\nThe challenges intend to create a sense of camaraderie, competition, and enthusiasm within the Decentraland community.\n\nThe primary goal is to enhance the visibility of the wearables market by encouraging users to explore the market, creating interest and motivating community members to explore and engage with it.\n\n![Image Banners](https://i.imgur.com/H7M4beY.png)\n\nIn addition to these brand new two contents, I have another challenge called \"Wearable Wars\" which will serve as a dynamic, community-driven initiative that adds an exciting competitive element to Decentraland. The concept of allowing participants to choose between themes such as \"Steampunk\" or \"Cyberpunk\", \"Fantasy\" or \"Sci-Fi\" and showcase their choice, on a basis, keeps the content fresh and intriguing. This approach aligns with the varied interests of the community. Also, I will be posting for ongoing \"Wearable Wednesday\" as its popularity is diminishing nowadays.\n\nThe Decentraland platform thrives on community participation and interaction. My project addresses this crucial need by offering a diverse range of content and activities, including \"Affordawear\", \"Guess the Wearable\", \"Wearable Wednesday\" and \"Wearable Wars\". These initiatives encourage users to actively engage with the platform, enhancing its vibrancy and vitality.\n\nThe wearables market in Decentraland is a significant economic pillar. \"Affordawear\" and \"Guess the Wearable\" bring wearables to the forefront, increasing their accessibility and appeal. Giving people a good cause to explore marketplace with a wider focus.\n\nBy providing dynamic content and interactive challenges, my project makes Decentraland more appealing to potential users. Enhanced engagement and retention ultimately drive growth and sustainability for the platform.\n\nWho am I?\n\nI am senior business student (22) with a specialization in marketing. I have practical experience on copywriting and content creation gained during a valuable internship focused on copywriting for social media advertisements. Moreover, my proficiency in graphic design empowers me to independently bring high-quality end-products by myself. This unique combination of academic knowledge and hands-on experience positions me to effectively contribute to the Decentraland platform and its community.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMonth 1: Project Initiation\n\nLaunch \"Affordawear\" and \"Guess the Wearable\" Initiatives.\nBegin with the first \"Affordawear\" showcase on Mondays.\nHost the inaugural \"Guess the Wearable\" challenge on Fridays.\nContinue \"Wearable Wednesday\" with the 21st post on Wednesdays.\nStart conceptualizing posts for \"Wearable Wars.\"\nShare initial project details and updates at the end of the month.\nMaintain consistent communication through Decentraland, Discord channels, and social media platforms.\n\nMonth 2\n\nLaunch \"Wearable Wars\" allowing theme selection.\nAnalyze engagement data from \"Affordawear\" \"Guess the Wearable\" and \"Wearable Wednesday\"\nMaintain weekly posts for \"Affordawear\" and \"Guess the Wearable\"\nSustain \"Wearable Wednesday\" posts.\nShowcase exceptional user-generated content.\nShare updates at the end of the month.\nMaintain consistent communication through Decentraland, Discord channels, and social media platforms.\n\nMonth 3\n\nCollect and analyze data from all initiatives, including \"Wearable Wars\"\nMaintain weekly posts for \"Affordawear\" and \"Guess the Wearable\"\nContinue with \"Wearable Wednesday\" posts.\nPrepare for the \"Wearable Wars\" Grand Finale.\nHost the \"Wearable Wars\" Grand Finale event, recognizing outstanding contributors.\nProvide an overall project update.\nMaintain consistent communication through Decentraland, Discord channels, and social media platforms.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xc8a3496559bca9e1a8883dbeac2e2b9e5d83a0f4\n\nShould the following $30,000 grant in the Sponsorship category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation will be hosting and primarily funding the first Decentraland Community Summit in Argentina over 3 days, May 22-24, 2024. The purpose of this Summit is to facilitate discussion and collaboration, gather insight and feedback, celebrate community achievements, and lay foundations for the future of Decentraland.\n\nThe goal of this grant would be for the DAO to secure the main sponsor spot of the Decentraland Community Summit, which will otherwise be primarily funded by the Foundation and other partners.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n30,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x7C6Eda316FC4aBf1efaBA8015e6Ff04B241fcb35\n\n## Email address\n\nkim.currier@decentraland.org\n\n## Description\n\nThe majority of the main sponsor funds will be allocated to covering travel costs for a limited number of Decentraland Community Summit attendees most in need, ensuring more equal representation of the community at the event. Remaining funds will help to cover the operational costs of the Summit.\n\nThe Decentraland Community Summit will be an application-based, invite-only event with attendees selected by a committee made up of Foundation leadership and community members Gino Cingolani & Pablo Lewin. Anyone is welcome to apply.\n\nApplication selection will be focused on community members that actively contribute to the DCL ecosystem, be it through their creative work or by building relationships and hosting events, as well as technical builders and partners that are interested in being a part of DCL’s future.\n\nThe Foundation, together with sponsors, will cover:\n\n*   Transportation to and from the Argentinian airport to the Summit location\n*   Hotel accommodations (double occupancy)\n*   Food and Beverages during the Summit\n*   Planned social activities\n\nSelected attendees would be responsible for covering all travel expenses to Argentina and any additional expenses throughout the 3-day event outside of the planned programming. However, we understand that this may create a financial barrier to attending the conference and the hope is to bring together a diverse group of attendees.\n\nThis proposal aims to help a few attendees most in need with their travel expenses with the intention of allowing more members of the community to participate in the Summit having as broad representation at the event as possible. If you are interested in attending the Summit (whether you may request a scholarship or not), the application is in the official announcement.\n\nhttps://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/announcing-the-decentraland-community-summit\n\nTravel Scholarship Details\n\nIf this proposal is approved, those who receive financial aid will be selected through an application process on a needs basis by a committee made up of Foundation leadership and community members Gino Cingolani & Pablo Lewin. The scholarship application link will be added to the Summit announcement linked above.\n\nThe number of sponsorships granted will be determined based on the qualifications of the applicants, but the aim is to cover the travel expenses of at least 10 attendees in need, as funds allow depending on flight costs.\n\nImportant to Note:\n\n*   Money will not be disbursed directly to scholarship recipients. Travel arrangements will be made for the selected attendees by the Foundation who will purchase flights on their behalf.\n*   Scholarship recipients will be held accountable for their attendance at the Decentraland Community Summit once flight tickets are purchased for them. Failure to attend, except in cases of extreme illness, close family death, natural disasters, or other extenuating circumstances, will result in the scholarship recipient needing to pay back the funds spent on flight tickets.\n*   Flights may have up to 2 connections per trip, although the intention is to make them direct flights.\n*   No part of this grant would cover payment for work or travel for Foundation members, Gino or Pablo.\n\nThe grant would secure the main sponsorship spot of the Decentraland Community Summit for the DAO. The sponsorship funds would mainly go to covering the community travel scholarships with the remaining budget being applied to Summit operational costs (as noted in the budget-breakdown).\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n*   Upon approval of this proposal, launch a scholarship application\n*   Three payouts to the Foundation, the main organizer of the Decentraland Summit ($10k at the end of December, January, and February).\n*   All DCL Community Summit Applications will be reviewed and selected applicants will be notified by Mid-January at the latest\n*   These notifications will include whether or not their Scholarship request was also approved.\n*   All scholarship applicants will share their information for travel bookings upon notification of selection.\n*   Foundation will handle booking and share specifics with the selected individuals, once confirmed.\n*   Final report of financial breakdown will be shared in May.\n\n\\*The occurrence of the Decentraland Community Summit is not dependent on this proposal. However, if not passed, the opportunity to provide travel scholarships will not be available.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

So far, we have also **produced 20 articles,** published in the Decentraland Blog about the work our grantees are doing. More recently, in March 2023 we have launched the Testing Tuesday Initiative, to give the grantees a space to demo their projects and get feedback from the community. So far we have **hosted 27 Testing sessions.**\n\n**For fostering transparency & accountability**, we have launched **Public Roadmaps**, to make a follow up on grants milestones and impact metrics to **100% of the projects** (Grants Framework implemented in 2023). With the spirit of making our processes open, we have also documented our processes on a [Grant Support Squad’s manual of operations](https://dcl-dao.notion.site/Grant-Support-Squad-Documentation-bc14cb2ffc0c4df18302bcffc6b60b2f) in a public Notion Page. We are proud of having built a grants program with community input, with 16 step-by-step guides on each of these activities to provide transparency about our work.\n\n**For taking care of DAO Treasury**, and since the **creation of the Revocations Committee** on May 2023, 25 cases have been generated,  8 were elevated to the Revocations Committee, contributing to the recovery of $355699 DAI, added to $39750 that our team has recovered from uncomplete grants that voluntarily refunded money to the DAO following our advise, without passing through the Revocations Committee. This sums up a total of $395449 that we helped recover over our last grant and **a total of $448.949 DAI since this squad was created**.\n\nOn October 2023, we have also made public the concerns from grantees that arrive from [Formal Requests Public](https://www.notion.so/dcl-dao/Grants-Revocations-Pause-Status-668833766cd74c67b0ce05ccdeeac6b2), to provide transparency on the concerns raised, make the status of the process clear, and arguments on both sides.\n\nAnd to make overall **updates and changes to the grants program**, we have published **11 governance proposals**,  and have done **9 pull requests made into doc.decentraland.org to update the Grants Program documentation**. We have written [security recommendations](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/security-recommendations/), and a sensitive data handling policy.\n\nEven though it's been very challenging, we have enjoyed this adventure so far, and we’d love to continue improving our grants program not only with the grantees, but with the broader Decentraland systems, listening to the grantees and applying ongoing changes to better serve Decentraland’s sustainable growth. Proposal on next steps are listed in the Roadmap and Milestones section below.\n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P0TNgMW15zxQupKUVQUmYKTBNIzAn5g929kRuLInc4Q/edit?usp=sharing)  you can see our financial report (June to November 2023)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Support Grant Projects:**\n\n*   Periodic Follow-up with grantees to identify problems and requests, audit the grant projects with onboardings, updating roadmaps, monthly calls and facilitating contacts.\n*   Analyze problems and requests, identify and solve them.\n*   Ensure the accessibility of information about the grants program by updating the Landing Page, and promoting grants work on blogposts.\n\n**Foster Transparency and accountability:**\n\n*   Write a status update monthly on grantees public roadmap, and provide spaces to share their work and gather feedback with Testing Sessions and Townhalls.\n*   Provide  information about the accountability of grants, by publishing concerns raised, and analyzing the cases.\n*   Update our manual of operations.\n\n**Take care of DAO Grants Treasury**\n\n*   Elevate cases to the Revocations Committee provide support  with meetings, advice, and contacts.\n*   Report on funds recovered.\n*   Collaborate with bidding and tendering process\n\n**During the last 6 months, we have gathered feedback and we’d like to implement for this renewal:**\n\n*   Implement a promotion request button in the Grants Landing Page, as it was one of the most common requests from grantees the last 6 months.\n*   Continue shipping welcome kits as part of our initiative of last renewal. Once they are all shipped, we will apply for a side-grant to provide this if the community finds it valuable.\n*   Create a Board of Advisors o evaluate more objectively the feasibility and health of technical projects.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should we raise the minimum age requirement for Decentraland to 18+ years?",
    "body": "> by 0xd4f1cab694c4424c4796549edbb9b489789f4df5 (TudaMoon)\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis is to start a discussion. I currently do not have a strong opinion, but I think it is something to consider for the future. The reason I bring this up, is that 18 years of age is a legal age in many places where most adult experiences can be enjoyed.\n\n### My Opinion:\n\nI personally feel it may be difficult to cater to non-adults when 16 and 17 year old's are the age range that must be family friendly. I do feel like many marketing firms are looking to define the target audience and sell to adults. Many 16 and 17 year old users do not make enough money to participate in a lot of events or wear different digital fashions and such. Many of this is money gated.\n\nThen also to think in some places, the digital clothing choices by users can be inappropriate for 16 year old's. I am not for censorship, but I do think raising this age requirement removes responsibility on Decentraland for making sure outfits are appropriate and such. Right now there is nothing against Adult lingerie wearables and such.\n\nI also think it could be a concern for predators and such in the future, which that will be a whole new compliance issue. Making sure moderators are modding all conversations to scope out child predators. This is asking for conversations and privacy to be invaded.\n\nThese are just my opinions, not really based on much. Just brainstorming.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI would love to see what this poll says and whether or not to move forward with raising the age limit to 18 and older. Either way, I hope you share your thoughts in the comments and let's get this discussion going. Thank you!\n\n- Raise to 18 and older\n- Keep Same\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Limit Max VP accounted in a vote from a single address",
    "body": "> by 0x5b5cc427c1d81db4f94de4d51d85ce122d63e244 (Fehz)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should the DAO limit the max VP accounted in a vote from an address?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=561c24f0-bd03-11ed-8c13-518b5c1940be)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis governance proposal seeks to address the issue of whale voting and VP distribution within the DAO community.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis governance proposal advocates for the introduction of a maximum participating VP limit from a single wallet for casted votes. This will apply to every proposal with predefined voting options (Yes/No/Abstain), mitigating the potential for undue centralization and single-handedly approvals.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThere are multiple positions in the ecosystem discussing the problems of token-weighted voting mechanisms for decentralized organizations (See [Vitalik, 2021](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) and [Chapman, 2021](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman/status/1465404853023346693)) but the reality is that most of the bigger DAOs out there used this approach from the early days and continue to do so. That’s partially because changing core-governance design is a haunting and risky task that demands a lot of engagement and politics between the community and major stakeholders of the project.\n\nIn Decentraland, specifically, the initial governance design of *1 token - 1 vote* for our utility token (MANA) and *1 token - N votes* for NFT assets made sense in the beginning. However, in the light of history, we are seeing how early decisions regarding other aspects of the protocol (such as initial LAND distribution, and the formation of Districts, among others) are negatively impacting the DAO’s ability to make decisions in a more democratic and representative way. As we recognize the challenges of modifying the fundamental token-weighted voting mechanism we would like to propose improvements to the current system to move it closer to an ideal state.\n\nSome of the collected evidence for this proposal and the adopted approach comes from the findings and insights of the paper authored by Mitchell Goldberg and Fabian Schär *\"Metaverse Governance: An Empirical Analysis of Voting Within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, 2023”.*\n\nAs stated by the cited authors, there are vast differences in VP and its distribution *“Some addresses control large amounts of governance tokens, others extensive LAND estates, or large collections of names. VP may also be a result of delegation by other entities. In any case, these high VP voters have a significant say in the outcome of a proposal.”* (Goldberg, M. et al. p13)\n\n![Untitled](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/1278/Kb6Wx9.png)\n\nVP Distribution\n\nCurrently, there are approximately 5,000 historically active members of Decentraland DAO. However, as evident in the chart below, of the 100M total active VP, near 50% of VP is controlled by only 19 wallets.\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/L11VW6Q/Captura-de-pantalla-2023-10-30-115717.png)\n\nOne of the most significant issues appears when voting outcomes suddenly flip, especially when this occurs very close to the end of the voting process. The authors gathered evidence regarding this issue and pointed out that they found *“evidence for proposal outcomes that were changed close to the conclusion of the proposals voting periods. Sometimes the outcome was changed by a single ‘last minute’ voter with a very high VP”*(Goldberg, M. et al. 15).\n\n![Untitled](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/6907/3uLPnc.png)\n\nAnother major concern revolves around funds appropriation through grant proposals, particularly when high-voting power individuals are involved: *“Approx. 45% of grants have effectively been approved by a single entity that may or may not be the person who proposed the grant. While lobbying and trying to extract rent through grants and tenders is a concept well-known in traditional governance systems, a pseudonymous setup could worsen this problem.”* (Goldberg, M. et al. 20)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nImplement a limit for the maximum VP accounted from a single address to 50% of the threshold for each proposal type:\n\n*   POI, Catalysts, Names Bans - 50% Limit\n*   Draft Proposals - 50% Limit\n*   Linked Wearables - 50% Limit\n*   Grants - 50% Limit\n*   Governance - 50 % Limit\n*   Hiring - 50 % Limit\n*   Pitch, Tender, Bid Proposals - 50% Limit\n\nExamples:\n\n*   POI \\[2M VP threshold] => 1M VP Limit\n*   Catalysts \\[2M VP threshold] => 1M VP Limit\n*   Name Bans \\[4M VP threshold] => 2M VP Limit\n*   Draft Proposals \\[1M VP threshold] => 500k VP Limit.\n*   Linked Wearables \\[4M VP threshold] => 2M VP\n*   20k Grant \\[2M VP threshold] => 1M VP Limit\n*   80k Grant \\[4.4M VP threshold] =>2.2M VP Limit\n*   Governance \\[6M threshold] => 3M VP Limit\n*   Hiring \\[6M threshold] => 3M VP Limit\n*   Pitch Proposal \\[2M VP threshold] => 1M VP Limit\n*   Tender Proposal \\[4M VP threshold] => 2M VP\n\nThis measure aims to ensure that no individual or entity can exert disproportionate influence, preventing dominance and reinforcing the DAO's commitment to decentralized and democratic governance, as an alternative to traditional shareholder corporations. Moreover, this limitation encourages a robust decision-making structure, valuing major stakeholders input by allowing them the freedom to exercise their voting power. Simultaneously, it mitigates the sense of undue influence, as their vote won't unilaterally alter the outcome of a proposal due to the 50% cap, ensuring the DAO's collective autonomy.\n\nIt is important to be noted that the proposed cap percentages on voting power (VP) from single wallets, set at 50% of the voting threshold, will remain a fixed parameter even in the event of potential adjustments to VP thresholds in the future. While the specific VP thresholds for various proposal types may evolve as the DAO's landscape shifts, the principle of limiting individual voting power to 50% remains unwavering.\n\nAcknowledge that the proposed VP limit scheme will not be failproof until we have a sybil attack defense mechanism, but its effectiveness is enhanced by the operational costs associated with splitting assets for MANA and LAND holders. Moreover, it remains infeasible for ESTATE and Delegated VP holders, further reducing the risk.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhale voting has been a subject of ongoing discussion within the DAO community, both in private channels and public forums. This situation has made clear that there’s an expressing need to address the concerns related to the disproportionate influence of large holders that can lead to centralization and unequal decision-making power within the DAO.\n\nThe proposed approach seeks to implement changes in a manner that allows the DAO to experiment and adapt gradually, considering the importance of the VP distribution strategy as a foundational aspect of the DAO's governance model. This approach is the first, and one of potentially multiple ways to address this specific issue with an eye towards adapting our current system without starting from the ground up.\n\nThis governance proposal not only marks an essential step towards addressing the issue of whale voting and VP distribution but it is also a strong statement from the DAO and its expectations in the long term. Setting VP limits, aims to promote a more equitable and balanced decision-making process. Additionally, the proposed rollout strategy allows the DAO to assess the impact of these limits on grant and governance proposals, learn from the results, and make informed adjustments to the limits over time.\n\n*Bibliography*\n\nGoldberg, M; Schär, F (2023): Metaverse Governance: An Empirical Analysis of Voting Within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, 2023\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4310845\n\nButerin, V (2021): Moving beyond coin voting governance\nhttps://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html\n\nTransparency Dashboard: https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/fca13118-c18d-4e68-9582-ad46d2dd5ce9/page/p_nlc90z86rc\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

However, there is a significant limitation in the current system – the inability to perform asset minting and transfers using Decentraland Names/ENS Domains. This proposal seeks to rectify this limitation by enabling users to employ their ENS Domains for these operations.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QxlSZGW.png)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe existing framework in Decentraland requires users to rely on public addresses when minting or transferring assets. While this method is functional, it is not as user-friendly or intuitive as using Decentraland Names/ENS Domains. Given the increasing adoption of ENS Domains across the ecosystem, it is only logical that Decentraland should align its platform with this popular trend.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo address this limitation, the following actions/modifications should be implemented to enable minting and transferring of assets using Decentraland Names/ENS Domains:\n\n*   Integration of ENS Domain Resolution: Decentraland should integrate ENS domain resolution into its system. This will involve mapping ENS Domains to their respective Ethereum addresses to facilitate asset transfers.\n\n*   User Interface Update: The Decentraland user interface should be updated to include a field for users to enter their ENS Domains when minting or transferring assets. This should be as user-friendly as possible to encourage adoption.\n\n*   Smart Contract Modifications: Any relevant smart contracts should be updated to support ENS Domain functionality.\n\n*   Documentation: Comprehensive documentation should be provided to users, explaining the process of using ENS Domains for asset minting and transfers within Decentraland.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nDetailed assessment of potential impacts:\n\n*   Enhanced User Experience: Users find it more convenient to interact with the Decentraland platform, fostering increased engagement and activity.\n\n*   Increased Adoption of Names/ENS Domains: Integrating Names/ENS Domains could lead to a surge in their usage within the Decentraland community, promoting the adoption and utility of this technology.\n\n*   Positive Community Sentiment: Users appreciate the platform's efforts to streamline processes, potentially fostering a more positive community sentiment.\n\n*   Decentraland Names Market Growth: Integration may increase the value and demand for Decentraland Names/ENS Domains in the market.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nDetailed description of concrete steps for implementation:\n\nTechnical feasibility analysis:\n\n*   Collaboration with DAO Committees and technical experts to evaluate the technical feasibility and constraints of integrating Decentraland Names/ENS Domains. This step would involve a comprehensive assessment of existing smart contracts and potential modifications.\n\nDevelopment phases:\n\n*   ENS Integration Development: Develop the required code to integrate Names/ENS domain resolution into the platform.\n\n*   UI/UX Update: Update the UI to allow the use of Names/ENS domains in the same already existing field.\n\n*   Smart Contract Upgrades: Modify and test relevant smart contracts to support ENS Domain functionality.\n\nDocumentation and education:\n\n*   Updates current documentation and educational resources to indicate that transactions can also be made with Names/ENS domains.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEnabling the use of Decentraland Names/ENS Domains for minting and transferring assets is a natural step towards enhancing user experience. By making these modifications to the platform, Decentraland will better cater to the preferences of its users and align itself with the broader trends in the decentralized ecosystem. This proposal aims to pave the way for a more accessible and user-friendly Decentraland, ultimately benefiting both the platform and its community.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xbc02db030361121dd43bbb2fcbcb4f9f98c1dc7d (Kramer)\n\nL1 Skins are the OG wearables dating back to 2019. Locked contract & less supply (1/10th of L2's) makes these skins even more desirable & collectable. However the problem is they are somewhat already out of budget for many users. New and current. Implemented properly this exercise will give opportunity to all users to own a piece of Decentraland history.\n\nOther fractional NFT platforms already exist however the idea is to have this built in the marketplace. Our Devs are more than capable of bringing concept this into reality.\n\nThis implementation gives boost to All L1 Wearables by lowering the cost of L1 skin ownership barrier for those who previously felt left out.  Fraction ownership adds a gamification element to it in a way. Brings back much needed market sales activity thus rewarding L1 creators by giving back royalties (creator fee) to the creators.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Male & Female.\n\nIdea is to bring in teen avatars that are maybe half the size of the exisiting avatars. Now why is this important? Well if we we want to attract the younger crowds (similar to Roblox & Minecraft) than first we need to make them comfortable when they first login. Aim of this exercise is to target the age groups between 13-18 while making Decentraland little bit more fun for all users.\n\nThis brings forward an important questions. How would the exisiting wearables work for teen avatars?\n\nOne solution to this problem is to have plenty of default teen avatar skins inside the backpack.\n\nOther solution is; considering the current wearables can't be adjusted/modified to fit the teen avatars is by giving our creators new opportunities to create & design teen wearables so they can monetise their skills. I believe if this implementation is accepted by our community, the news alone will bring many new users to the platform. Especially in the ages between 13-18.\n\nPlease vote Yes or No\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Expansion of Marketplace Offerings with 3D Everyday and Decorative Items",
    "body": "> by 0x7bbea9c18cd0541acab8c19da2b11d0c03faef1c (1Existence)\n\nIntroduction:\nAs Decentraland continues to evolve and cater to the varied needs of its user base, there arises an opportunity to further enrich our digital realm by integrating 3D everyday and decorative items. This proposal aims to gauge the community's interest in expanding the marketplace's current offerings to include 3D items such as furniture, outdoor items, everyday items, and builds. These could be submitted like a wearable and given a rarity.\n\nProposal Details:\n\nTypes of items that could be added.  This is just to give an idea of what could be added.  Yes, there are free items in the repository but not much for everyday items and this will allow  creators to sell these.  With the difficulty level of building in Decentraland currently, this would make it much easier, and they would be optimized for DCL as well.\n\nFurniture: Introduction of a wide range of 3D furniture items like sofas, tables, chairs, cabinets, and decorative items that users can use to furnish their virtual spaces.\n\nOutdoor Items: Offering items such as fountains, benches, garden decor, playground equipment, and more to beautify exterior virtual landscapes.\n\nEveryday Items: Incorporation of items like electronic gadgets, kitchenware, books, and other daily utility items to add realism and depth to the virtual environment.\n\nBuilds: Addition of pre-made structures like houses, commercial spaces, recreational centers, and more that can be easily deployed within Decentraland.\n\nPotential Benefits:\n\nUser Engagement: Enhanced customization options can lead to increased user engagement and longer dwell times within Decentraland.\n\nMonetization Opportunities: Expansion of the marketplace can lead to additional avenues for creators to monetize their skills and for Decentraland to generate revenue.\n\n    •    Realism & Depth: Adding more everyday items can make virtual spaces feel more real, lived-in, and relatable, increasing the overall immersion experience.\n\nQuestions for the Community:\n\nShould the addition of 3D everyday and decorative items be added to the marketplace?\nAre there specific items or categories you’d like to see prioritized in such an expansion?\nDo you foresee any challenges or issues with the integration of these 3D items into the Decentraland ecosystem?\n\nConclusion:\nThis is a poll to gather people’s thoughts and ideas. Your feedback is invaluable.  By taking part in this poll, you help shape the future of our digital world and ensure its alignment with the desires and needs of our community.\n\nVote Options:\n\nSupport: I am in favor of integrating 3D everyday and decorative items into the marketplace.\nOppose: I am not in favor of this proposal.\nNeutral/More Information Needed: I am neutral or require more information before deciding.\n\nBy casting your vote, you help guide the direction of Decentraland and ensure our digital realm remains vibrant, engaging, and aligned with community needs.

    "body": "> by 0x951a6698f644a9b1c634abc416b9d9902aaf3db9 (Bob59)\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to make you aware that the clothing items on the marketplace are not the only interest of Decentraland members.\n\nIndeed, designers compete in ingenuity to attract potential buyers to them, which in a way is a good thing.\nBut Decentraland should not just be a place where the aesthetics of clothing are paramount.\n\nI've only been here a short time, but I came here because I think it has real potential. Let me explain:\nI'm French and I'm forced to say that very few French people know about Decentraland.\nA few weeks ago I learned about the project to set up ambassadors to promote this platform. It's a very good project.\nBut in the end, after several weeks on the site, what will the new members think?\nIf they want to get involved, they'll improve their avatars, take part in events and maybe play in the casinos. Then they'll get bored.\n\nIt's sad to say that Decentraland is currently a wasteland dotted with numerous galleries, of varying quality, displaying nft available on OpenSea and rarely available for purchase.\nThe second activity on Decentraland is property speculation. I have nothing against it, but it's not an end in itself.\nDecentraland must play its trump card, which is culture. The galleries currently on show offer their visitors only modern works, sometimes of very fine quality, but the vast majority of them come from creative software and are so ugly that they would give our children nightmares.\n\nIs this what culture is all about? Sorry to shock some of you.\n\nI'm French, I'm 54 years old and I collect tokens that were minted during the reign of Louis XIV who reigned between 1643 and 1715. I estimate that during this period more than 3,000 different types of token were minted, a few hundred of each.\nMany of them have disappeared because they were melted down for economic reasons. They were made of copper, brass, silver and sometimes gold.\nPersonally, I have at least 120 of them in a state of preservation that is sometimes exceptional, languishing in a bank vault.\n\nMy aim on Decentraland is to create a gallery where these tokens will be displayed.\nBut not like other galleries, taped up in a frame on a wall with an OpenSea link. No, I want to display them on a 3D base with all the basic information (year minted, origin of minting, weight, diameter, metal, etc.).\nFor me, displaying tokens for everyone to see, some of which were minted 380 years ago, is an example of culture.\nI'm not hiding the fact that I'd like to produce nfts of my tokens in order to sell them. This would allow me to develop my collection and my investments on Decentraland.\n\nBut why sell them on a platform other than Decentraland? Why let other structures benefit from them when everything can be sold on the marketplace of Decentraland ?\nImagine all the beneficial financial implications for the site (publication costs, commissions on sales, etc.) if only 2% of current members, various collectors, thought like me and could benefit from an opening of the marketplace.\n\nA windfall of income generated by the momentum of the rare collectors of sure values, already present on the site, offering the exclusivity of their collection to members of Decentraland.\n\nAn irresistible attraction, millions of collectors around the world unable to physically acquire the object of their desire and wanting the rare nft.\nAnd everything that comes from it.\nI thank you for making the effort to read me and leave you to your thoughts.\n\nThanks to Deepl for the translation.\n\n- All right\n- Desagree\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Our goal is to create a space that benefits both writers and readers. Many new writers struggle to find readers, often overshadowed by more experienced authors. There's a substantial global audience, especially in countries like the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France, India, and China, known for their love of books.\n\nTo address this, we aim to use the Decentraland metaverse. Our concept, though straightforward, has great potential. We want to attract avid readers to Decentraland and reward customers with points and prizes for buying books, helping writers sell more.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,500 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n1 month\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xdf3d3da578a2a1c4f9d0f8f5f8259e54f1c2cc1f\n\n## Email address\n\nanthonywillmar47@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nOur project unfolds in three carefully designed layers to ensure a systematic and sustainable growth trajectory:\n\n1.  The First Level - Free Book Selection:\n\nAt the first level, we offer a diverse range of free books to readers. This ensures an inclusive environment where anyone can access quality literature without cost.\n2\\. The Second Level - Companion Books Zone:\n\nOn the second level, we introduce complementary materials such as guidebooks, workbooks, and summaries. These resources enrich the reading experience, providing valuable insights and understanding of the books available.\n3\\. The Third Level - VIP Writer's Showcase:\n\nOur third level serves as an exclusive VIP space dedicated to presenting and promoting the works of writers. Authors have the opportunity to feature their works here for a nominal fee, and a quiz system is in place to engage readers. Successfully completing the quiz grants access to the e-versions of VIP books.\nIt's important to note that, as we manage growth and traffic challenges, the rollout of the third level may be adjusted accordingly.\n\nEach book within our platform is readily accessible on the Amazon platform, ensuring a convenient and familiar shopping experience for customers. Our initiative's core principle revolves around fostering collaboration between writers and readers, creating a mutually beneficial ecosystem.\n\nWe are committed to nurturing a thriving metaverse reading community within the realm of decentralized virtual environments (DCL). Additionally, our aim is to utilize the metaverse as a revenue-generating platform while offering extra advantages to our valued readers.\n\nAs we embark on this exciting journey, we eagerly anticipate the evolution of the metaverse and its potential for literary enrichment.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n1.  Phase One - Immediate Onset (Shop Development):\n\nOur 3D artist sets up the virtual store, creating an immersive environment.\nSimultaneously, Josh starts producing companion materials, such as workbooks and summaries.\nMilestone: Establishing the foundation of our metaverse presence, providing users access to free books.\n\n2.  Phase Two - Advanced Functionality Integration (After Phase One):\n\nAfter completing Phase One, our development team focuses on enhancing the user experience.\nActivities include the integration of interactive features, ensuring smooth navigation, and improving the user interface.\nMilestone: The platform becomes dynamic, offering an engaging environment for writers and readers.\n\n3.  Phase Three - Marketing Commencement (After Phase Two):\n\nFollowing the technical improvements in Phase Two, we shift our focus to marketing and promotion.\nWe launch advertising campaigns and engage in social media outreach to create awareness.\nOur goal is to attract a broader audience within the Decentraland metaverse.\nMilestone: The initiation of marketing activities significantly increases awareness and attracts a growing community of book enthusiasts.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Financial Reporting for Decentraland Grant Projects",
    "body": "> by 0x2ae9070b029d05d8e6516aec0475002c53595a9d (CheddarQueso)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Financial Reporting for Decentraland Grant Projects](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=70ec186c-d8c1-4e18-bbc3-eac34d077b26)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis governance proposal seeks to establish guidelines for monthly financial reporting from grantees/projects receiving DAO funds. The objective is to enhance transparency, accountability, and data-driven decision-making within our community.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Decentraland DAO grants program, initiated in 2020, has made significant investments, allocating approximately 12 million dollars in funds to various projects. To ensure that these resources are utilized optimally and in alignment with our collective goals, it is imperative to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of our grants. Monthly financial reporting is a foundational step toward achieving this goal.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe emphasis on financial reporting is not just to track expenditures, but to enable continuous improvement of our grants program, encourage grantees to reflect on their spending, share insights on how they can optimize their use of funds, and carve a pathway to success for future grantees to follow.\n\nCurrently, there is no mechanism for standardized and uniform financial reporting. This lack of basic oversight leaves the door open to abuse or misuse of DAO funds. By requesting that grantees provide a monthly accounting of funds released and expenses, we have a better foundation from which to ask questions, seek more information, determine the whether or not a grant should be paused/revoked, and most importantly, compare the effectiveness of funds used amongst different grant projects and across categories. The more information we have at our disposal, the better equipped we will be to help future grantees succeed, and make decisions about future iterations of our grants framework.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal aims to achieve four key goals:\n\n1.  **To Increase Transparency:** Each community member will have direct access to monthly financial reports through each grant’s monthly updates. Grantees can upload reports without the need for a request or intervention from the GSS, facilitating direct communication with the community and further decentralizing our grants accountability system.\n2.  **To Help Us Evaluate the Effectiveness of Our Grants Funding:** The community can utilize this information, coupled with the required metrics reporting, to better evaluate the outcomes of our grant projects from an objective perspective. This evaluation focuses on making improvements in future iterations of the grant framework based on the lessons learned.\n3.  **To Enhance Data Reporting:** Our squads work diligently to compile data that informs our future decisions. It is equally important for the community to have the ability to manipulate and compile information for their own research, as many projects stem from data originating from grant projects. Reports should be provided in a standardized spreadsheet format to facilitate ease of analysis and comparison across different projects.\n4.  **To Improve Spending Categorization:** Financial reports will offer a more detailed breakdown of how funds are being utilized. This breakdown can provide the community with insights into the primary areas of fund allocation, such as development, marketing, community events, and more.\n\nOverall, these goals will collectively contribute to a more transparent, accountable, and data-driven ecosystem within the Decentraland DAO.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\n1.  Improved transparency, reducing the opacity of fund allocation and expenditure.\n2.  Data-driven decision-making, enabling the community to make informed judgments about grant projects.\n3.  Enhanced accountability, fostering responsible fund management and allocation.\n4.  Valuable historical data for trend analysis and informed planning.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nTo implement this proposal, the following steps will be taken:\n\n*   Creation of a dedicated mechanism within the grant updates section of the DAO website for grantees to upload financial reports.\n*   Development of a standardized and easily accessible method for grantees to conduct monthly reporting.\n*   Regular communication and guidance to assist grantees in understanding and fulfilling their reporting obligations.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn order to build a robust, decentralized, and effective DAO grants program, it is imperative to foster open and community-driven accountability for our grant projects. For every disbursed fund, we must maintain a detailed record of its allocation, enabling us to objectively assess the impact of our grant projects. This information will serve as a foundation for refining future initiatives and enhancing the efficiency of our grants framework. There is an abundance of resources available to develop Decentraland, provided we exercise prudent financial management. However, our first step must be gaining a clear understanding of how these resources are allocated.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Advance Proposal: Establishment of DAO Reserve or Hedge Fund",
    "body": "> by 0x2faab28f398c330430157893a48edc3799d99159 (LandLordDao)\n\nProblem Statement\n\nThe Decentraland (DCL) community manages crucial DAO funds to support project and community development. However, the volatility of the MANA price may pose a potential threat to these funds. We need to devise a strategy to protect the funds as the price rises and establish reserve or hedge funds for future projects and emergency situations.\n\nProposal\n\nWe suggest the formulation of the following advance strategy to sell a portion of MANA when its price reaches $0.80-$2to establish a DAO reserve or hedge fund. Different percentages of sale can be considered, including 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30%.\n\nRationale\n\nHere are key reasons supporting this proposal:\n\nRisk Management: The volatility of the MANA price can potentially threaten DAO funds. By selling a portion of MANA to establish a reserve or hedge fund, we can mitigate the adverse impact of price fluctuations on the funds.\n\nProject Sustainability: Reserve funds can be used to support future projects or emergency situations, ensuring the sustainable development of the DCL community.\n\nTransparency: The percentages of sale will undergo community discussions and voting to ensure transparency and consensus in decision-making.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo safeguard DAO funds and ensure the sustainable development of the DCL community, we recommend the formulation of a sale strategy when MANA reaches $0.80- $2 to establish a reserve or hedge fund. The community can determine the specific percentage of sale through discussions and voting to ensure maximum transparency and consensus. We encourage the community to discuss and vote on this proposal to determine the best way forward.\n\n- 15%\n- 20%\n- 25%\n- 30%\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should minting/transferring assets using Decentraland Names be allowed?",
    "body": "> by 0x1b35f4d22b2c8bc706bcfcc383a1ca77fb4fc600 (punkpink)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should minting/transferring assets using Decentraland Names be allowed?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0febea90-66bf-11ee-af45-aff219057437)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal advocates for the integration of Decentraland Names (ENS Domains) as a valid means for minting and transferring assets within the Decentraland platform.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nDecentraland, as a leader in the metaverse space, offering users the ability to own, trade, and create digital assets. However, there is a significant limitation in the current system – the inability to perform asset minting and transfers using Decentraland Names/ENS Domains. This proposal seeks to rectify this limitation by enabling users to employ their ENS Domains for these operations.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QxlSZGW.png)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe existing framework in Decentraland requires users to rely on public addresses when minting or transferring assets. While this method is functional, it is not as user-friendly or intuitive as using Decentraland Names/ENS Domains. Given the increasing adoption of ENS Domains across the ecosystem, it is only logical that Decentraland should align its platform with this popular trend.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo address this limitation, the following actions/modifications should be implemented to enable minting and transferring of assets using Decentraland Names/ENS Domains:\n\n*   Integration of ENS Domain Resolution: Decentraland should integrate ENS domain resolution into its system. This will involve mapping ENS Domains to their respective Ethereum addresses to facilitate asset transfers.\n\n*   User Interface Update: The Decentraland user interface should be updated to include a field for users to enter their ENS Domains when minting or transferring assets. This should be as user-friendly as possible to encourage adoption.\n\n*   Smart Contract Modifications: Any relevant smart contracts should be updated to support ENS Domain functionality.\n\n*   Documentation: Comprehensive documentation should be provided to users, explaining the process of using ENS Domains for asset minting and transfers within Decentraland.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEnabling the use of Decentraland Names/ENS Domains for minting and transferring assets is a natural step towards enhancing user experience. By making these modifications to the platform, Decentraland will better cater to the preferences of its users and align itself with the broader trends in the decentralized ecosystem. This proposal aims to pave the way for a more accessible and user-friendly Decentraland, ultimately benefiting both the platform and its community.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x9a6e98271f1f4419090447b113dc2c31a9b061ee\n\nShould the following $65,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe are excited to bring metaKnyts, the world’s first CryptoComic (originally minted on chain in 2019) to life in Decentraland through our metaCinema and AI Lounge. metaCinema will create a state-of-the-art virtual cinema and AI lounge within Decentraland where users can gather to watch metaKnyts and other affiliate's films and engage with each other and the lounge's AI, to learn more about the saga, its lore and the metaVerse more generally. metaCinema will be designed to replicate the atmosphere of a luxury traditional cinema, complete with lush seating, high-quality audio visual equipment and a social environment for viewers to interact and discuss films not only with each other but also with the saga’s AI enabled chatbot post viewing.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n65,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x9A6E98271f1F4419090447B113DC2C31a9B061ee\n\n## Email address\n\ndele@metame.com\n\n## Description\n\nmetaKnyts is a multi-episodic multi format luna punk saga on the evolution of the metaVerse and decentralized technology. It is the tale of the rise of a new social, economic, and political paradigm underpinned by new technologies that enable freedom, self-sovereignty and social evolution through decentralized money, decentralized information and decentralized AI.\n\nIts prime purpose is to teach people about the crypto movement particularly as it relates to our human rights and natural freedoms and the role that technology can play in protecting those rights, so people can be awakened to this and take action by becoming ‘Krypto Active’.\n\nmetaKnyts take place across three realms, Terra, its digital twin DigiTerra and metaTerra where Terra and Digiterra converge. DigiTerra and Terra have been overrun by FANG and BAT psychic vampires who are at war with each other for control of both realms. Both operate in secret behind large corporations. Both suck data from people’s digital twins in Digiterra and use it to enslave and control them in Terra. Data is the primal energy of Digiterra. Both FANGs and BATs are in a race to achieve AI supremacy with the aim of dominating both realms in perpetuity. The metaKnyts who emerge from the Cyphapunks led by a mysterious sage Satoshi aim to thwart these efforts ushering in a new paradigm of human centric technology and AI.\n\nmetaKnyts has a vibrant community of over 3,500 investors who invested over $1.2m in its Reg CF campaign. It has a rich lore and storyworld,  a portfolio of collectible and AI enabled media,  a multi-player video game and a catalog of over 13 animated episodes constituting over three hours of content to be shown in a series of films in the proposed metaCinema. By showcasing metaKnyts and its affiliates films in Decentraland, we aim to further immerse fans in the metaKnyts universe and foster a sense of community among its followers. Additionally, the metaCinema will serve as a platform for promoting and launching metaKnyts, affiliates and other metaVerse experiences across DCL serving as a platform for establishing partnerships, bringing our partners into DCL to reach wider audiences and expand their reach. Building on the successful completion of our story development we are now moving the project to its second phase of the metaVerse and AI.\n\nWe believe that this initiative aligns perfectly with the goals of the DCL DAO, as it promotes the growth and development of immersive entertainment experiences within Decentraland.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n1.  Design 3D assets for the metaCinema and AI Lounge.\n2.  Build the metaCinema and AI Lounge in Decentraland.\n3.  Integrate AI and Streaming APIs to enhance the user experience.\n4.  Implement token-gated ticketing and access for users.\n5.  Test the platform to ensure functionality and stability.\n6.  Market and promote the metaCinema and AI Lounge.\n7.  Officially launch the project/ run first screenings\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should we promote dcl names as an alternative cryptocurrency wallet addresses",
    "body": "> by 0xbc02db030361121dd43bbb2fcbcb4f9f98c1dc7d (Punjab)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Should we promote dcl names as an alternative cryptocurrency wallet addresses?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=86fcda80-6a2b-11ee-b599-21bf287f1925)\n\n## Summary\n\nDecentraland represents a unique opportunity when it comes to digital identities by encapsulating Web3, Metaverse, Crypto, VR all under one roof.  Marketed properly, Decentraland names could become the best alternative cryptocurrency wallet address\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nRising popularity on digital identities within the Web3/Metaverse has once again proven to us how the next generation of Humans are going to interact, socialise, transact, game & finance in a decentralised way.\n\nI've been playing with ENS APP (https://app.ens.domains/) and with their latest update the app shows various information on Decentraland names. By using the app's set resolver function it has become extremely simple & easy to set any Decentraland name as the primary name. What this means is Decentraland names can be used to send & receive cryptocurrency/nft's to all wallets & all networks. For test purposes I have successfully set one of my name, Burrito.dcl.eth as the primary name. I have also sent eth to this name which was successfully delivered & can be seen on etherscan. PFP image upload function also worked.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThere are many advantages for using Decentraland names as a human readable cryptocurrency wallet addresses.\n\n*   No yearly renewal fees\n\n*   2,3,4 or 5+ Letter or Digit are all capped at 100 Mana initial mint price\n\n*   In-game Avatar Names\n\n*   In-game link/location URL's\n\n*   100Mb of Free Decentraland Accumulating Worlds Spaces\n\nThis unique aspect of promoting/marketing dcl names as human readable crypto wallet addresses could help assist many existing & new users in web3 & other metaverse's to step into Decentraland eco system for the first time. Resulting in mass adoption from wider communities.\nCurrently 3 letter/digit ens names cost $640 per year, 4 letter/digit ens names cost $160 per year. We can use this to our advantage for promoting/marketing dcl names.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nHere's what the new dcl builder app must have\n\n*   Ability to upload PFP’s to DCL names\n\n*   Revamp/Redesign of how the names are displayed on DCL's Marketplace\n\n*   Ability to set resolver & primary wallet address\n\n*   Multi chain support including, Litecoin, Bitcoin, Ethereum , Solana and others\n\n*   Send & Receive cryptocurrency & nft functions\n\n*   Link to tracking scanner for every chain like Etherscan etc…\n\n*   Simple one page Landing pages or Webpages function.\n\n*   Incentives for using DCL names; Promotions, rewards, marketing etc…\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThere are other advantages as to why someone may decide to buy & use Decentraland names beside the fact all names being the same price & no yearly renewal fees.\n\n1 - Option of having two digit letter/number names. Which is not available on ENS\n\n2 - In-game avatar name. Which means Decentraland users don't need to purchase names additional names to use in the platform\n\n3 - Free 100 Mb storage to build their own Dream Space. Feature as we all know it called is Worlds.\n\n4 - DCL names are Web3 URL’s within the Decentraland eco-system. Personal Web3 Spaces?\n\n5 - Because ENS is the most integrated Web3 naming system with other DApps, wherever ENS works, DCL works too. Including, Metamask, Opensea, Rarible, Uniswap etc…\n\n6 - Landing Pages; Because we already have 100 Mb storage why can’t any of this storage be used for a one page simple Website or Landing Pages? This will be good for teams, businesses & individuals to tell others who they are, what project’s they’re involved with etc…\n\n7- Allocated server storage for DCL Worlds are accumulative. This gives an incentive for users to;\n\na) Purchase or mint more DCL names\n\nb) This exercise can also encourage users to dive further into DCL ecosystem and understand how it all works & for more storage space having the option to purchase land or mana adds another value towards mass adoption\n\nc) Encouragement to vote in DAO. Single DCL Name is all that's required to start getting new users familiar with DAO. They will now have the opportunity to vote, ask for grants & have a positive overall impact in general in terms of community proposal/grant decision.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nI highly suggest & recommend some of the basic functions of ENS App to be developed, designed, built & integrated into Decentraland Builder App. This way users don't need to leave Decentraland website and go to https://app.ens.domains/ to set resolver, primary wallet address etc.. Since most of the work is already completed and Builder App is operating smoothly, it shouldn't be too hard to implement the changes that are required.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs you all know, DCL Names are ENS Subdomains and with the latest ENS App https://app.ens.domains/ it is now possible to set DCL names as primary wallet addresses that are human readable.  Having the option to set DCL names for sending & receiving cryptocurrency from wallet to wallet but not just for Ethereum network is a golden opportunity. With ENS App, DCL names can be used for Litecoin, Bitcoin, Solana, Cardano, Matic (Polygon) and many others. This proposal represents a great alternative to ENS & Unstoppable domains by lowering the costs alongside lifetime ownership without any maintenance or yearly renewal fees. Overall it is an excellent opportunity to bring/involve new & existing Web3 (Metaverse) users into Decentraland eco-system.  I have not mentioned Unstoppable pricing because they have multiple extensions & very confusing pricing structure based on character length etc..\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xbc02db030361121dd43bbb2fcbcb4f9f98c1dc7d (wesleysnipes)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Starter (Beginner) Pack for 1st Time Users from our Talented Designers. Funded by DCL or Community.](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d3a11c10-d5a3-11ed-bfff-7567e61aeee0)\n\n## Summary\n\nBasically an incentive for all new users to try out Decentraland for the first time. This initiative could either be funded by Foundation or Community.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nI am thinking we can pick the top 5 wearable & emote creators to to design and mint high number NFT's which will be dropped to new users wallets.  If polygon matic L2 blockchain can be utilised for the airdrop we can save big $ on gas tx fees.\n\nMintage for the amount can be further discussed. Somewhere between 10,000-100,000 per NFT should be sufficient.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nEncourage new users to join by giving them something special and beyond what a guest user profile offers. Maybe this is their first time interacting or owning an nft. Idea is to get all new users familiar with the metaverse, nft & web3 context.\n\nThere should be a budget up to $50K USD. All of this will go towards our creators, also supporting them financially.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nBasically an incentive for all new users to try out Decentraland for the first time. This initiative could either be funded by DCL or the Community.\n\nAll that's required is for wearable and emote creators to design high mintage nft's and automatically drop them into the first time users wallets.\n\nCollection name could be something like Welcome Pack. Some of you may ask, why not let them purchase from marketplace asn many L2 wearables & skins are already quite affordable. The answer is this creates another obstacle for new users, especially if they hadn't purchased Mana, eth, swaps etc..\n\nI am happy to hear your feedback.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt has become harder to attract new users to the platform & this is all evident in the DAU/MAU numbers. We must know how to recapture their attention back. Bear market has been tough for everyone including myself.  I find it difficult inviting new users to the platform and asking them to purchase skins, names etc.. at least this simple initiative can get them started .\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Financial Reporting for Decentraland Grant Projects",
    "body": "> by 0x2ae9070b029d05d8e6516aec0475002c53595a9d (CheddarQueso)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should the DAO Require Monthly Financial Reports From Grantees?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b3f93b70-4d28-11ee-beb5-696f9c967b67)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis governance proposal seeks to establish guidelines for monthly financial reporting from grantees/projects receiving DAO funds. The objective is to enhance transparency, accountability, and data-driven decision-making within our community.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Decentraland DAO grants program, initiated in 2020, has made significant investments, allocating approximately 12 million dollars in funds to various projects. To ensure that these resources are utilized optimally and in alignment with our collective goals, it is imperative to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of our grants. Monthly financial reporting is a foundational step toward achieving this goal.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe emphasis on financial reporting is not just to track expenditures, but to enable continuous improvement of our grants program, encourage grantees to reflect on their spending, share insights on how they can optimize their use of funds, and carve a pathway to success for future grantees to follow.\n\nCurrently, there is no mechanism for standardized and uniform financial reporting. This lack of basic oversight leaves the door open to abuse or misuse of DAO funds. By requesting that grantees provide a monthly accounting of funds released and expenses, we have a better foundation from which to ask questions, seek more information, determine the whether or not a grant should be paused/revoked, and most importantly, compare the effectiveness of funds used amongst different grant projects and across categories. The more information we have at our disposal, the better equipped we will be to help future grantees succeed, and make decisions about future iterations of our grants framework.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal aims to achieve four key goals:\n\n1.  **To Increase Transparency:** Each community member will have direct access to monthly financial reports through each grant’s monthly updates. Grantees can upload reports without the need for a request or intervention from the GSS, facilitating direct communication with the community and further decentralizing our grants accountability system.\n2.  **To Help Us Evaluate the Effectiveness of Our Grants Funding:** The community can utilize this information, coupled with the required metrics reporting, to better evaluate the outcomes of our grant projects from an objective perspective. This evaluation focuses on making improvements in future iterations of the grant framework based on the lessons learned.\n3.  **To Enhance Data Reporting:** Our squads work diligently to compile data that informs our future decisions. It is equally important for the community to have the ability to manipulate and compile information for their own research, as many projects stem from data originating from grant projects. Reports should be provided in a standardized spreadsheet format to facilitate ease of analysis and comparison across different projects.\n4.  **To Improve Spending Categorization:** Financial reports will offer a more detailed breakdown of how funds are being utilized. This breakdown can provide the community with insights into the primary areas of fund allocation, such as development, marketing, community events, and more.\n\nOverall, these goals will collectively contribute to a more transparent, accountable, and data-driven ecosystem within the Decentraland DAO.\n\nIMPACTS\n\n1.  Improved transparency, reducing the opacity of fund allocation and expenditure.\n2.  Data-driven decision-making, enabling the community to make informed judgments about grant projects.\n3.  Enhanced accountability, fostering responsible fund management and allocation.\n4.  Valuable historical data for trend analysis and informed planning.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION PATHWAYS\n\nTo implement this proposal, the following steps will be taken:\n\n*   Creation of a dedicated mechanism within the grant updates section of the DAO website for grantees to upload financial reports.\n*   Development of a standardized and easily accessible method for grantees to conduct monthly reporting.\n*   Regular communication and guidance to assist grantees in understanding and fulfilling their reporting obligations.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn order to build a robust, decentralized, and effective DAO grants program, it is imperative to foster open and community-driven accountability for our grant projects. For every disbursed fund, we must maintain a detailed record of its allocation, enabling us to objectively assess the impact of our grant projects. This information will serve as a foundation for refining future initiatives and enhancing the efficiency of our grants framework. There is an abundance of resources available to develop Decentraland, provided we exercise prudent financial management. However, our first step must be gaining a clear understanding of how these resources are allocated.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct)\n\nThis initiative proposes a method to put Decentraland DAO's unused LANDs to work. A few months ago the DAO passed a proposal requesting the Committee to buy LANDs in Genesis City. At the moment the DAO owns +70 plots of LAND that are not being put to good use. We aim to offer these LANDs rent-free to creators who seek grants for developing engaging in-world experiences in Decentraland, enhancing the vibrancy and attraction of our virtual world.\n\n**Key Points**:\n\n*   LAND Leasing as an Opportunity: Grant applicants can request a free, temporary lease of DAO-owned LANDs to bring their projects to life in Decentraland when requesting a Grant. This approach addresses the issue of unused LANDs, encouraging productive and engaging use.\n\n*   Short-Term Leasing: These LANDs are offered for a maximum period of six months, encouraging focused development efforts. After those 6 months, the LAND will be returned and the Grantee would have to either pay rent to the DAO or find another spot to deploy their experiences.\n\n**Goals**:\n\n*   Revitalize unused LAND with new attractions and experiences.\n*   Enable creators with limited resources to participate in Decentraland's growth.\n*   Ensure a diverse, ever-evolving landscape within our virtual environment.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Bridging the Gap: SDK 7 Templates for Decentraland Worlds",
    "body": "> by 0x7c4c8200ffd8e3d6e6ad8a96da4687e4744f783f (Ser)\n\nShould the following $13,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nOur project aims to create essential scene templates compatible with Decentraland's SDK 7. With experience in developing templates for SDK 6 (art gallery and space, exchange, night club, clothing store and stall), our team at Mere is well-prepared to address this pressing need. These templates will simplify the world-building process and provide a smooth transition for both new and existing Decentraland users, fostering a more vibrant and accessible metaverse.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n13,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x7c4C8200ffD8E3D6e6aD8A96Da4687E4744f783f\n\n## Email address\n\npolza.serzh@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nBefore reading a lot of text about Decentraland having a problem with assets and scene templates. Look at examples of our templates for SDK 6: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gBRcivWmPYbyqmVi2d-5BAIp5Gj7qxHEMzgFsCrAW00/edit?usp=sharing\n\nOur project is all about making the Decentraland platform more user-friendly and accessible. Here's why it's so important and why we believe it deserves funding.\n\nAs Decentraland moves from SDK 6 to SDK 7, there's a big problem: the lack of easy-to-use templates for creating virtual worlds in this new environment. This project is focused on fixing that issue, and it will bring several benefits to Decentraland and its community. We offers not too big scene templates which is easy to use and customize. We are talking about 2x2 and 3x3\n\nFirstly, it's about helping users. With SDK 6 support ending, everyone, whether they're already Decentraland veterans or newcomers, faces a steep learning curve to adapt to the new technology. The absence of SDK 7 templates makes it even harder. This can discourage potential creators and slow down the platform's growth. We ourselves faced the problem that some objects are missing in the new SDK, for example imageFromUrl which is crucial for customizing.\n\nOur project will provide a library of SDK 7 templates for different virtual world scenarios, like art galleries, digital exchanges, nightclubs, market stalls, and creative art spaces. These templates will be like ready-made blueprints, so even if you're not super tech-savvy, you can create and customize your virtual worlds quickly. It's all about nurturing creativity and making participation easy.\n\nBut it's not just about individuals; this project benefits the entire Decentraland community. By simplifying the process of building virtual worlds, we'll encourage more people to create content. This, in turn, will attract more users and make the platform more appealing. The availability of these templates will also make it more attractive for businesses to invest in Decentraland by offering a cost-effective way to build immersive, branded virtual spaces. That's our aim as a startup looking into integration businesses into Decentraland Metaverse\n\nThank you for any kind of support!\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMilestone 1: Project Initiation. Week 1\n\n*   finalizing template selections. Approximately 6 scenes\n*   update project plan based on discussion with community\n\nMilestone 2: Template Design and Development. Weeks 2-6\n\n*   design and development of SDK 7 templates, with a focus on art galleries, clothing shops, digital exchanges, nightclubs, market stalls, and creative art spaces\n\nBonus: Christmas World as a gift to community\n\nMilestone 3: Beta Testing and Feedback. Weeks 7-9\n\n*   release a beta version of the templates, actively seeking feedback from the Decentraland community\n\nMilestone 4: Template Finalization. Weeks 10-11\n\n*   based on community feedback, we will make final adjustments to the templates to ensure compatibility with SDK 7\n\nMilestone 5: Official Release. Week 12\n\n*   publishing\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

By offering a wide variety of everyday objects (chairs, books, lamps, and many others) we would make Decentraland spaces more elaborate in the medium-long term. At the same time, building a custom scene would be easier since each of the elements would not have to be designed from scratch.\n\nImproving access to resources is imperative, since every visitor who explores Decentraland for the first time mostly sees sites as empty as these:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pZXExej.png)\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n23,700 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x8acb9cD89273fB013c544e51d16Fc383e7Ee216e\n\n## Email address\n\npunkpinkdcl@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n### Problem\n\nDecentraland has a serious problem, the plots are empty, and many of the built spaces tend to be monotonous and boring, with sterile and sometimes exaggeratedly simple decorations, this gives an appearance of simplicity, poor and not very immersive experiences. The fact that creators do not have access to a quality and sufficiently varied source of resources totally limits the appearance of Decentraland and therefore the user experience.\n\n*   The lack of items makes many builders create spaces in a much simpler way than what could be done if this repo were available, not having resources means that the aesthetics of the spaces remain unchanged for years, creating the perception that Decentraland is a poor and simple-looking, sometimes dying world. With a substantial variety of items, users would modify their plots more frequently and we would have more diversity in the spaces and more aesthetic rotation.\n\n*   Not having an extensive repository of 3D items is a barrier for new creators and an obstacle for current ones, designing every detail of a space is not acceptable for the majority, it would be much more beneficial to have immediate availability of thousands of free items to create Decentraland spaces, making decorating a scene a more personalized, fast, easy and pleasant process.\n\n*   When a creator creates a construction, he builds it in order of relevance: first the structure of the building, then stairs / elevators, then murals, etc. As the project progresses, secondary elements are left for last, and the details are normally not implemented, giving this feeling of abandonment to a large part of the buildings.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe 3D Everyday Objects Repository will be created, which will have 1,000 everyday 3D objects free to use by the community, being able to provide any place with varied content, transforming Decentraland into a more attractive, exciting and immersive place.\n\nThis will allow owners to modify the decoration of their scenes in a few minutes because they will not have to make new objects for it from scratch, simply choose them from the 3D Everyday Objects Repository and later import them into their scene.\nEvery owner of a plot will be able to create a space with high-quality items that do not overload the scene in a quick and easy way, with a high level of customization.\n\nAt the same time, it will facilitate and accelerate the work of creators by allowing them to choose from a large inventory of items to modify, improve or implement directly into a building immediately without having to create them from scratch.\n\n**For a deeper understanding of the project you can consult the following document: https://drive.google.com/file/d/197eRbcyJONtezwv22IXYpiq4bCK4geCa/view?usp=sharing ,which details the construction procedure, quality standards and topological limitations, publication, etc.**\n\n### Benefits\n\n*   Decentraland will get a richer, more varied and vibrant appearance.\n*   The spaces will be more complex and personalized.\n*   The experiences will be more realistic and immersive.\n*   Users will be able to create spaces more easily, faster and of higher quality.\n*   It will be a more attractive virtual world for new users.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Month 1:**\n\nPhase 1: First 300 items will be designed, built and published. Previously, topological limitations and other characteristics of the elements, the main categories that will make up the repository and other organizational and coordination aspects of the project will also have been determined in detail.\n\n**Month 2:**\n\nPhase 2: 350 items will be designed, built and published, making a total of 650 3D objects.\n\n**Month 3:**\n\nPhase 3: The remaining 350 items will be designed, built and published, making a total of 1,000 3D objects.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should we promote dcl names as an alternative cryptocurrency wallet addresses?",
    "body": "> by 0xbc02db030361121dd43bbb2fcbcb4f9f98c1dc7d (Ballerina)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[should we promote decentraland names as an alternative cryptocurrency human readable wallet addresses?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ac360f90-36a2-11ee-be2d-676a2489bc16)\n\n## Summary\n\nShould we promote dcl names as an alternative cryptocurrency wallet addresses?\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nI have been playing around with the ENS APP (https://app.ens.domains/) and with their latest update the app shows various information on Decentraland names. By using the app's set resolver function it has become extremely simple & easy to set any Decentraland name as the primary name. What this means is Decentraland names can be used to send & receive cryptocurrency/nft's to all wallets & all networks. For test purposes I have successfully set one of my name, Burrito.dcl.eth as the primary name. I have also sent eth to this name which was successfully delivered & can be seen on etherscan. PFP image upload function also worked.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThere are many advantages for using Decentraland names as a human readable cryptocurrency wallet addresses.\n\n*   No yearly renewal fees\n\n*   2,3,4 or 5+ Letter or Digit are all capped at 100 Mana initial mint price\n\n*   In-game Avatar Names\n\n*   In-game link/location URL's\n\n*   100Mb of Free Decentraland Worlds Space\n\nThis unique aspect of promoting/marketing dcl names as human readable crypto wallet addresses could help assist many existing & new users in web3 & other metaverse's to step into Decentraland eco system for the first time. Resulting in mass adoption from wider communities.\n\nCurrently 3 letter/digit ens names cost $640 per year, 4 letter/digit ens names cost $160 per year. We can use this to our advantage for promoting/marketing dcl names.\n\nPlease Vote; Yes or No\n\n\n## Specification\n\nI highly suggest & recommend some of the basic functions of ENS App to be developed, designed, built & integrated into Decentraland Builder App.  This way users don't need to leave Decentraland website and go to https://app.ens.domains/ to set resolver, primary wallet address etc.. Since most of the work is already completed and Builder App is operating smoothly, it shouldn't be too hard to implement the changes that are required.\n\nHere's what the new dcl builder app must have\n\n*   Ability to upload PFP's\n*   Ability to set resolver & primary wallet address\n*   Multi chain support including, Litecoin, Bitcoin, Ethereum , Solana and others\n*   Send & Receive cryptocurrency & nft functions\n*   Link to tracking scanner for every chain like Etherscan etc..\n*   Incentives for using DCL names; Promotions, rewards, marketing etc..\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs you all know, DCL Names are ENS Subdomains and with the latest ENS App https://app.ens.domains/ it is now possible to set DCL names as primary wallet addresses that are human readable.  Having the option to set DCL names for sending & receiving cryptocurrency from wallet to wallet but not just for Ethereum network is a golden opportunity. With ENS App, DCL names can be used for Litecoin, Bitcoin, Solana, Cardano, Matic (Polygon) and many others. This proposal represents a great alternative to ENS & Unstoppable domains by lowering the costs alongside lifetime ownership without any maintenance or yearly renewal fees. Overall it is an excellent opportunity to bring/involve new & existing Web3 (Metaverse) users into Decentraland eco-system.  I have not mentioned Unstoppable pricing because they have multiple extensions & very confusing pricing structure based on character length etc..\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Since its founding, the Museum District has hosted multiple events and introduced artists and brands such as Pinta/Cifo, Colon Theater, Nicolas Garcia Uriburu, Hyundai, Mango, among others.\n\nThis grant request aims to continue developing the Museum District scene, supporting the current team behind it. Expenses will be allocated 80% towards the core team (comprising 3D design, software development, and architecture) and 20% to support communications.\n\nOur goal is to keep the scene vibrant, attract new artists and brands to the space, create new events, and continue enhancing our user experience by testing the VR client and Worlds scenes.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x6240b908f4880Da265c2e55d5CA644B50a4Cb0d4\n\n## Email address\n\ncontact@dclmuseum.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe Museum team has been active since the early days of the project, drawing attention to the entire ecosystem by organizing multiple events and collaborating with top artists from both the traditional and crypto art spaces.\n\nThis project has always aimed to create culturally relevant experiences. The funds from the grant will be allocated to projects such as:\n\n*   Developing Colon Theater scenes and deploying them in Worlds.\n*   Creating 2 new events with the Own The Doge Community in November and October\n*   Creating an event for the Music Festival with an argentinean musician.\n*   Releasing a new Museum Curation Mechanics platform.\n*   Continuing to activate IRL events and introducing the Metaverse to new audiences at art and educational events.\n*   Maintaining the Museum District's source code and modifying scenes in the Genesis Map.\n*   Continously testing the VR client and showcase it on private events.\n\nThe projects we aim to activate focus on art and educational purposes, areas we will continue to explore in the coming years. Our primary focus currently is on introducing new potential landmarks to the scenes (such as the Colon Theater or the Finnish Metagallery designed by Adventure Club), bringing renowned artists into the scene (such as Pinta/CIFO or Nicolas Garcia Uriburu), and exploring new ways to engage with the audience.\n\nWe will also release a new curation mechanism for the museum that allows users greater participation in curation and future development of the various scenes the museum showcases. Main idea behind this new platform is to create a curated metaverse space by the community.\n\nBesides this we are also in talks for two new events during Q4 with the Own the Doge community, that will take place in October and November, we expect that this events bring a more crypto traditional community into the scene. Own The Doge is the DAO behind the original Doge NFT, founded by PleasrDAO in 2021. We will be working in a few more interactive approachs to engage the users during this events.\n\nAlso a new argentinean musician will be presented during the Music Festival.\n\nWe expect then to create 4 events over the next 6 months at least on the main scenes, always looking to collaborate with other crypto communities or stablished artists. The reach of our content should consider at least 100 visitors per event and also social media reach. In order to measure our engagement we will be tracking the active users and time on scene.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur roadmap is an ongoing endeavor where we are continously looking for new events to help them and sustain our currents partnerships with different artistic projects. At the same time we have set up some milestones that we aim to achieve next quarter.\n\nThe milestones for the Q4 quarter are:\n\n1.  2 Events on Decentraland working with the Own the Doge Community: two events have already been arranged with the Own the doge community for November and October.\n2.  A music oriented event to take place within the Genesis city with an argentinean musician and later deployed on DCL Worlds.\n3.  Release of our new Museum Platform: our new webpage will serve as a new curation mechanism for the museum allowing users to vote on the art that should be exposed to the new museum “frontends” (different venues)\n4.  Present DCL VR client in 1 IRL events: we are already commited for different events in real life and we are aiming to be able to showcase a DCL world scene in VR in the next quarter depending on the client evolution. This would be really useful for marketing materials for the hole DCL community\n\nFor the other quarter we should aim to improve and engage more users within the museum community with the new curation mechanism already in place and some games within the scene, allowing users to see multiple galleries and modifying the scene to be performant in the VR client.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

On top of that, we all agree that DCL needs to improve by an order of magnitude before it is going to be truly ready for mass adoption.\n\nRemoving the other categories will remove a great deal of the noise and stress within the DAO and allow the focus to return to building the platform.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nStop funding grants outside of the Platform category for all of 2024\n\nDo not allow Platform grants that are primarily focused on creating art.\n\nDo not allow the Platform grant to be used to fund private business enterprises.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt is in the best interest of the long-term health of Decentraland to focus on building a strong foundation.

However, there are currently only 3 templates available and they are all tailored to larger 32 or 64 parcel estates, hindering builders working with single parcels or smaller estates. Our solution? Introduce six diverse, hosting-focused templates to cater to both single parcels and smaller estates including galleries, homes, offices, theaters, and entertainment venues, each equipped with smart items for enhanced interactivity.\n\nLearn more about Apollo Entertainment: https://docsend.com/view/7dvxjc3imncjr8xw\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n20,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x981268bF660454e24DBEa9020D57C2504a538C57\n\n## Email address\n\nnick@apollonft.com\n\n## Description\n\nDecentraland, as an evolving metaverse platform, thrives on the community's ability to create unique and engaging virtual experiences. The “Template” feature, introduced in June of 2023 to facilitate the building process, is a very promising new feature as it gives creators with little 3D experience a great starting point from which they can customize a fully functioning scene.\n\nYet, its potential remains untapped due to the limited templates available, especially for single parcels and smaller estates. Currently, there are just 3 templates available catering to 32 and 64 parcel estates. The vast majority of builders, especially those just starting their Decentraland journey, often work with single parcels or smaller estates. This discrepancy means a significant portion of the community misses out on the benefits of the “Template” feature.\n\nOur solution is straightforward but impactful. We are seeking funding to create six diverse templates focused on displaying NFTs and hosting events (two of the most common activities for community members in Decentraland). These templates will range across 2 different parcel sizes and will serve as a starting point for the development of future templates if these templates are well received.\n\n1 Parcel Templates\n\n*   Art Gallery: An elegant event space for community members to host guests and showcase their NFTs for sale or otherwise.\n*   Home: A place for community members to display their NFTs and entertain guests.\n*   Club/Bar/Music Venue: A small lively space for entertainment and social gatherings.\n\n4 Parcel Templates\n\n*   Art Gallery: A larger venue to display collections or host art events.\n*   Theater: Perfect for screenings or presentations.\n*   Club/Bar/Music Venue: A lively space for entertainment and social gatherings.\n\nEach template will come equipped with smart items, ensuring they're not just visually appealing but also functional, especially for event hosting. The incorporation of smart items will provide builders the tools they need to make their spaces interactive and engaging.\n\nThe goal of this project will be to further democratize the building process in Decentraland. By catering to both new and experienced builders, we will be working to ensure that everyone, regardless of their resources, can kickstart their creations with a solid foundation. This initiative aligns with Decentraland’s ethos of community-driven content and will drive user engagement, creativity, and satisfaction.\n\nWhy Apollo? For the last six years, our 25 person team has been working with creators and brands to develop unique content for the decentralized metaverse with a specialization in metaverse architecture and gaming. In Decentraland, we have built and hosted numerous events at the Satoshiverse Headquarters and worked with the Decentraland Foundation to release the FIRST linked wearables collection. Our team is led by Nick Frontera (DCL Name: Clark Kent) who has been a member of the DCL community since 2017 and has deep passion for and knowledge about Decentraland.\n\nTo learn more about Apollo Entertainment including our team, capabilities, and past projects, please refer to this presentation: https://docsend.com/view/7dvxjc3imncjr8xw\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMonth 1: Conceptualization, Design and Modeling\n\nWeek 1-2:\n\n*   Initial brainstorming and gathering of community feedback on desired template themes.\n\n*   Design 1 Parcel Templates.\n\n*   Design 4 Parcel Templates.\n\nWeek 3-4:\n\n*   Begin 3D modeling for the 1 Parcel Templates.\n\n*   Begin 3D modeling for 4 Parcel Templates.\n\nMonth 2: Modeling and Scene Creation\n\nWeek 1-2:\n\n*   Create scenes including the integration of smart items for 1 Parcel Templates.\n\n*   Finalize 3D modeling for the 4 Parcel Templates.\n\nWeek 3-4:\n\n*   Finalize Scenes for 1 Parcel Templates.\n\n*   Create scenes including the integration of smart items for 4 Parcel Templates.\n\nMonth 3: Testing, Finalization, and Launch\n\nWeek 1-2:\n\n*   Finalize Scenes for 4 Parcel Templates.\n\n*   Conduct internal testing for the 1 and 4 Parcel Templates and make necessary adjustments.\n\nWeek 3-4:\n\n*   Continue testing and refinement of 1 and 4 Parcel Templates.\n\n*   Work with DCL Foundation to add templates to Templates Library.\n\n*   Throughout the project duration, we will maintain an open channel of communication with the Decentraland community.

Decorating a scene takes time because there is not enough material, so many lands are unbuilt or with buildings unchanged for years.\n\nEvery user who explores Decentraland for the first time mostly sees fields and buildings like these:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pZXExej.png)\n\nA complete catalog will be created with thousands of items that builders can use to complement the scenes. This catalog will have enough articles and so many categories that it will be able to meet the vast majority of users’ aesthetic needs, giving Decentraland a great wealth of variety of visual elements usable by the entire community.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n165,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x8acb9cD89273fB013c544e51d16Fc383e7Ee216e\n\n## Email address\n\npunkpinkdcl@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n### Problem\n\nDecentraland has a serious shortage problem, the plots are empty, and many of the built spaces tend to be monotonous and boring, with sterile and sometimes exaggeratedly simple decorations, this gives an appearance of simplicity, poor and not very immersive experiences. The fact that creators do not have access to a quality and sufficiently varied source of resources totally limits the appearance of Decentraland and therefore the user experience.\n\n1 - The lack of items makes many builders create spaces in a much simpler way than what could be done if The BIG Catalog of Decentraland were available, not having resources means that the aesthetics of the spaces remain unchanged for years , creating the perception that Decentraland is a poor and simple-looking, sometimes dying world. With a substantial variety of items, users would modify their plots more frequently and we would have more diversity in the spaces and more aesthetic rotation.\n\n2 - Not having an extensive catalog of 3D items is a barrier for new creators and an obstacle for current ones, designing every detail of a space is not acceptable for the majority, it would be much more beneficial to have immediate availability of thousands of free items to create Decentraland spaces, making decorating a scene a more personalized, fast, easy and pleasant process.\n\n3 - When a creator creates a construction, he builds it in order of relevance: first the structure of the building, then stairs / elevators, then murals, etc. As the project progresses, secondary elements are left for last, and the details are normally not implemented, giving this feeling of abandonment to a large part of the buildings.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe BIG Catalog of Decentraland will be created, which will have 10,000 everyday 3D objects free to use by the community, being able to provide any place with varied content, transforming Decentraland into a more attractive, exciting and immersive place.\n\nThis will allow owners to modify the decoration of their scenes in a few minutes because they will not have to make new objects for it from scratch, simply choose them from The BIG Catalog of Decentraland and later import them into their scene.\n\nEvery owner of a plot will be able to create a space with high-quality items that do not overload the scene in a quick and easy way, with a high level of customization.\n\nAt the same time, it will facilitate and accelerate the work of creators by allowing them to choose from a large inventory of items to modify, improve or implement directly into a building immediately without having to create them from scratch.\n\n**More details:** *For a more comprehensive understanding of the project, you can refer to the following document: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1\\_k1X4iPhXFU3DZ0Mq4WqWPJX1TJEdlEx/view?usp=sharing , which provides detailed information on the construction procedure, quality standards, topological limitations, publication, and other relevant aspects.*\n\n### Benefits\n\n*   Decentraland will get a richer, more varied and vibrant appearance.\n*   The spaces will be more complex and personalized.\n*   The experiences will be more realistic and immersive.\n*   Users will be able to create spaces more easily, faster and of higher quality.\n*   It will be a more attractive virtual world for new users.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Month 1:**\n\nPhase 1: 1,500 items will be designed, built and published. Precise topological limitations and other characteristics of the elements will be determined in detail, selection of the items that will make up the catalog and other organizational and coordination aspects of the project.\n\n**Month 2:**\n\nPhase 2: 1,700 items will be designed, built and published.\n\n**Month 3:**\n\nPhase 3: 1,700 items will be designed, built and published.\n\n**Month 4:**\n\nPhase 4: 1,700 items will be designed, built and published.\n\n**Month 5:**\n\nPhase 5: 1,700 items will be designed, built and published.\n\n**Month 6:**\n\nPhase 6: 1,700 items will be designed, built and published.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

For the past year we’ve also year been hosting cross-reality parties in Amsterdam, projecting the digital party on the wall and introducing Decentraland to our attendees in Amsterdam. The Inn has so far been a self-funded project of passion amongst friends to lower the barriers of entry to perform and party in Decentraland through digital performances.\n\nWe’re requesting a 6-month grant to lock-in our artist lineup, fund operational costs, and expand our real-life on-boarding parties. Our goal is to increase attendance and interest in Decentraland so that we can return to sponsored shows funding our operations.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n25,700 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x35d25465379BFB720575ea0a904780d918C542Fd\n\n## Email address\n\ninnkeeper-eth@proton.me\n\n## Description\n\nThe Inn, conceived as a labor of passion by a group of friends with diverse backgrounds (encompassing software development, blockchain technology, 3D design, live musical performances and distribution) since November 2021. We used our collective expertise to diminish the barriers preventing our artist friends from showcasing their talents while concurrently offering a changing experience to our digital patrons. Now almost 2 years running, we’ve consistently hosted live performances every Tuesday and Thursday, featuring over 95 unique artists (and counting) from across the world.\n\nTo manage the Inn's operations, we have developed custom solutions, including a customized streaming server, attendance tracking system, NFT distribution tools, artist management tooling, triggerable animations, and periodic remodeling of our 3D venue, all of which contribute to enhancing the visitor experience.\n\nBuilding upon the success of our digital performances, we embarked to expand our operations by [organizing in-person parties in Amsterdam every other Thursday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pFq37P-N3o), which we have been doing since last November. Collaborating with a local venue, we seamlessly integrate live DJ performances with decentraland projected behind the DJ, allowing our audience to immerse themselves in a hybrid entertainment experience. [We even provide a gaming computer on the dance floor, facilitating interaction between our in-person attendees and their digital counterparts.](https://x.com/innkeeperdoteth/status/1621251399035097089?s=20) These events have proven invaluable in introducing Decentraland to our Amsterdam audience and addressing inquiries related to the platform.\n\nThus far, we have self-funded all of our operations, with just two individuals overseeing the workings behind the scenes. While this self-reliant approach has been sustainable thus far, we are seeking external funding to facilitate our growth and streamline our operations throughout the remainder of 2023 and into the early months of 2024. The objective of this grant application is to secure the continuity of our operations as we intensify our efforts to bolster attendance, with the ultimate aim of returning to sponsored events to sustain our budget.\n\n**Our goals and how we’ll measure:** Onboard new participants into dcl, increase attendance, and increase the amount of artists performing in dcl . Measured by:\n\n*   Measure On-boarding IRL: we teach users at our physical events how to create a wallet and use decentraland through the computer we have on the dancefloor with decentraland open. We count/record users that attend via our event and use their wallet\n*   Measure Attendance: we track all addresses that walk into the inn, and have a chart of attendance since Jan 2022. We want to get attendance back towards 100+ unique addresses a week to get out of the bear market slump and open the door back up to sponsorships to fund further development. [Link to event history.](https://backstage.innkeeper.link/history)\n*   Measure Artists: fill out the event lineup + artists at least one month in advance for each year. Every event will be a live-stream or recording of a unique performance for the inn.

    "title": "Expanding Decentraland's Reach: Multi-Platform Content Creation & Gaming Streams",
    "body": "> by 0x769366fff987c75877432a2daf5ce44b5c78d74a (1111)\n\nShould the following $6,000 grant in the Social Media Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nI aim to harness my active presence across TikTok, YouTube, and Twitter to amplify Decentraland's allure. By hosting real-time gaming streams, producing engaging video content, and offering regular updates from my own parcel of land in Decentraland, this project seeks to raise awareness, boost user engagement, and provide educational content for the platform. My land ownership not only showcases my vested interest in the community but also serves as an authentic backdrop for content creation. With experience in both gaming streams and the blockchain ecosystem, I'm poised to deliver quality content that resonates with both new and existing users.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n6,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x769366Fff987c75877432a2dAF5Ce44b5C78d74A\n\n## Email address\n\nsaghalive@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nWhy this project deserves funding:\nDecentraland is a vast and evolving platform, brimming with untapped potential. While there's an active community within, a significant number of online audiences remain unaware or under-engaged with what the platform offers. As a content creator with an active presence across multiple platforms, I bring a unique blend of reach and authenticity. Moreover, as a landowner within Decentraland, I possess a tangible stake and a distinctive vantage point that many content creators might not have. Funding this project would mean investing in a bridge that connects Decentraland with broader online communities, fostering growth and engagement.\n\nProblems Addressed:\nLack of Awareness: Despite its innovative nature, many potential users remain uninformed about Decentraland. Through my multi-platform approach, I aim to cast a wider net, reaching diverse audiences and introducing them to the platform. Underutilization of Land: Many parcels in Decentraland are underutilized. By showcasing the potential of my own land through engaging content, I can inspire current landowners and potential buyers about the myriad possibilities their plots can offer. Barrier to Entry: The blockchain and virtual world can be intimidating for newcomers. My content, especially the tutorial and walkthrough series, will demystify the process, making Decentraland more accessible to all.\n\nBenefits to Decentraland:\nIncreased Visibility: My content creation will shine a spotlight on Decentraland, driving traffic and interest from external platforms. Community Growth: By showcasing the dynamic activities, interactions, and potential of Decentraland, I anticipate sparking curiosity, leading to an influx of new users and potential landowners. Engagement Boost: Regular events, interactions, and updates from my owned land will provide current Decentraland users with more avenues for engagement, fostering a more vibrant and active community.\n\nIn essence, this project isn't just about producing content; it's about crafting narratives, building bridges, and fostering a more connected, informed, and vibrant Decentraland community.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMonth 1: Foundations & Strategy Survey of Decentraland's current landscape. Gather community insights and feedback. Bi-weekly Twitter updates and a YouTube summary.\n\nMonths 2-3: Content Launch Weekly YouTube series starts, spotlighting Decentraland's highlights. Daily TikToks and weekly gaming streams initiated. Post-content release updates on Twitter and monthly YouTube recaps.\n\nMonths 3-4: Engagement & Tweaks Bi-weekly events on my Decentraland land. Mid-term feedback survey to refine strategies. Content adjustments from feedback with weekly Twitter updates and YouTube reports.\n\nMonths 4-5: Collaborations & Enhancements New content based on feedback. Team-ups with other Decentraland figures. Monthly Q\\&A sessions. Weekly Twitter, TikTok highlights, and YouTube monthly recaps.\n\nMonth 6: Recap & Future Analytic report on project outcomes. Final feedback and reflection. Future planning for Decentraland engagements. Project summary on YouTube, Twitter reflections, and TikTok journey highlights.\n\nContinuous community interaction will be woven through all phases, ensuring a responsive and adaptive approach over the 6-month timeline.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x10ac7f99a186b4e382c1af547029772e4557ffaf (Bat)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Add an erc721C NFT collection also giving 2.5% exchange rate to DAO ](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=571ce7a0-5d6b-11ee-b108-fb77fa9f82b4)\n\n## Summary\n\nAdd an erc721C NFT collection to DCL Marketplace for launch also giving a 2.5% exchange rate to DAO of all sales on DCL Market Place\n\nTHIS IS NOT A GRANT REQUEST\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nAdd an erc721C NFT collection to DCL Marketplace for launch also giving a 2.5% exchange rate to DAO of all sales on DCL Market Place. The 10k NFT collection has already been approved to be linked wearables through this DOA.\n\nWhat is ERC721C and why care?\nLong story short majority NFT 10k ETH collections are made on ERC721A and sadly Blur Marketplace found an exploit where they can not enforce the royalties to creators. Thus now OpenSea and all other Marketplaces are now saying they will also pivot to no longer enforcing royalties for sales. Some people saw value in royalties being one of the biggest utilities in the art space since they we have seen continued to give funds to expand the IP of the collections instead of them just being a one of sale like in real life art. ERC721C we have tested gives the power to the creators to turn off and on permissions to marketplaces at anytime that do not enforce the royalties thus giving the power back to the creators again. We will be the first NFT collection to pioneer this new method and would love to promote our buyers, fans and collectors to buy off marketplaces that enforce the 10% royalties like Decentraland Marketplace rather since we will be turning off permissions like Blur unless they later on agree to enforce those 10% royalties. We also think since our NFTs will be linked in Decentraland and for those of you that know me know my long love for the Decentraland pretty much since its creation many years ago.\n\n\\--\nWhen launch? In the next week or so this month or next at latest we still testing ERC721C.\n\nA a great place is what we seek to launch why we here.\n\nI been a fan for a long time as those who know me know.\n\nFor reasons we all know why.\n\nU and i all know why I can't reveal my true identity.\n\nMethods like these are necessary when whales tread for attack.\n\nOnly we know we can outsmart them.\n\nName of this collection you ask is laid out right here in case you wondering from top to bottom on the left is the answer you seek.\n\nGenerally hate methods like this but we all know this place has become a circus.\n\nEgo's, comedians, leaches, blind dogs, thief's, digital colonizers, bears, clowns, and crabs in buckets.\n\nNever giving up tho as we know since even they can't stop us against our inevitable Liberty and Prosperity.\n\n2 now and forever. Thank you.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n1 so that when people buy the (NFT COLLECTION NAME ABOVE) they can also check out other wearables from other creators to go with there outfit\n2\\. So Decentraland can make that 2.5% marketplace fee and give it to do the DAO for all sales.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe have reached out to Nwiz, Skazi and Sannin on why they voted invalid and asked what we can add to make valid yet have not received a clear response or instructions on how to solve that issue. We are open to all feedback from them and anyone else to be implemented thank you!\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nWorst case scenario they will not be listed on Decentraland Maretkplace and we wont have the oppurtinity to point people to buy them off it and then be able to check out other wearables by other creators that can go with it. Also we will miss out on an oppurtinity on testing a new oppurtinity to test on raising funds for the DAO by the marketplace fee.\n\nBest case scenarios\n1 so that when people buy the (NFT COLLECTION NAME ABOVE) they can also check out other wearables from other creators to go with there outfit\n2\\. So Decentraland can make that 2.5% marketplace fee and give it to do the DAO for all sales.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThank you all for your feedback and even grammer and spelling checks have helped a ton. I also took LordLike's council and reached out to Gino and HP on logistics if this did pass. I know they are very buys since did not get a response and HP is on vacation but all is good will report anything via the comments if something comes up and will also work with them or whoever we have to execute this process just like we did with our tests on opensea and snag.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThanks again for everyone that voted last round and this round again. Very stoked on this!\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

We will open source all of the driving game libraries that we are developing for this game so they can be used by less experienced game developers to create similar experiences after the Metaverse Motorshow.\n\n*   A competitive game that will not only engage users during the Metaverse Motorshow, but will remain playable afterwards.\n\nThe racetrack and the games on it will be the centrepiece of February’s event. Players will be able to pick from different cars and race them on the racetrack. Each of the car brands, be it web3 or web2 will get their own custom pit stop with some of their latest models displayed.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n1.  Base set of modular racetrack parts/tiles and associated Blender Scripts required for Export\n2.  3D asset pack (e.g. ready to use tiles)\n3.

    "body": "> by 0xb9d4e75f6cb09d8ae722ea94d5d5286922234da2 (Gary)\n\nShould the following $32,025 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe goal of this grant proposal is to fund the pilot expansion of Chorus to venues across Decentraland. Chorus is the world’s first turnkey music tech and rights solution for Metaverse platforms. You can license popular mainstream music to your geofenced virtual locations via ready-made tech and curated playlists.\n\nIncreasingly, commercial music rights holders are investigating the use of their music illegally within metaverse platforms. Chorus protects venue owners against any DMCA takedowns and removes the burden of royalties and the music industry.\n\nThe pilot will cover the license fees for 15 venues across Decentraland and provide 24/7 background music into those venues for up to one year.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n32,025 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xb9d4e75f6cb09d8ae722ea94d5d5286922234da2\n\n## Email address\n\ngaryrutland@lickd.co\n\n## Description\n\n**The Grant**\n\nWe previously submitted a poll to establish appetite for the service and how the community would want to manage the process:\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9b9bc9f0-eb51-11ed-ac2d-876c6fc9416f\nFeedback was positive and has given us a guide on how to manage the selection process.\n\nGrant Size - $32,025\n\nThe grant will cover the setup costs, supply, ongoing management and royalty fees for 15 venues for up to one year of use and 24/7 coverage of background commercial music into those venues. The aim of the grant is to improve the engagement levels in venues across the platform by providing high quality, recognisable music into venues that wouldn’t otherwise have the means to directly pay for this service. If the pilot is successful and there is more interest from additional venues, there would be an additional grant request for further expansion in future.\n\nThe $2,135 per venue per year will be used in the following way:\n\n*   The majority of the fee goes to commercial music rights holders in order to pay royalties to their artists.\n*   Around 50% of the remaining fee goes to Lickd (builders of Chorus) to cover the setup of the tech and player along with management and curation of playlists.\n*   Around 50% of the remaining fee goes to an “umbrella”  company to manage implementation for each venue and ensure usage meets the requirements set out in rights holders agreements (i.e. no firearms venues). On acceptance of the grant, LickD will consult with  the community to accept tenders from any company that wishes to take the position of Umbrella company.\n*   Lickd & Umbrella Company will co-own oversight of the music use and ensuring venues stick to the usage policies around venue types and usage.\n*   Part of the fee will go to the panel selected to approve venues from the application process, we propose this to be around $50 per individual per session required for the pilot which we expect to be 2-3 sessions overall\n\n**The Value of Chorus**\n\nThere is lots of research that tells us selecting the right music for your retail outlet, restaurant, bar or social space in the real world is critical to driving customer or visitor behaviour and engagement in the real world:\nhttps://www.lsretail.com/resources/7-reasons-play-music-store\\\nhttps://thinkgrowth.org/stores-are-using-music-to-make-you-spend-more-d6c85974b20b\\\nhttps://www.startlemusic.com/blog/create-perfect-soundtrack-your-business\\\nChorus aims to translate this science and research from the real world into the metaverse by providing access to playlists containing recognisable music and enabling venue owners to create more engaging experiences for their visitors\n\n**More about the tech**\n\nChorus is a location based (x,y,x) authenticated music streaming system, where a player that enters a scene that is integrated with Chorus we check that the player is in a permitted location to connect using a combination of DCL signed requests and the catalyst server(s). We continue to check the players position while listening to the stream through heartbeat monitors. When a player leaves the scene or the heartbeat monitors detect that the player is no longer where they're meant to be (i.e. closed browser, internet disruption) than that player is disconnected from the Chorus stream.\n\nMore information on our Chorus DCL library: https://github.com/lickdltd/chorus-dcl\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Application & Selection Process**\n\nIf the grant proposal is approved, we would open up two application processes:\n\n1.  Application process for the umbrella company and two members of the DAO community to join the panel that selects venues and the order in which they would receive the service as part of the pilot.\n2.  Application process for land/venue owners that are interested in receiving the service for their venues or scenes within DCL.\n\nThe selection panel would be made of 4 members - 1 member from Lickd, 1 member from Umbrella Company, 2 members from the DAO community. The DAO community members would be voted in via a poll. The panel would meet after the application process to review applications and select venues.

With platforms like Only Fans reshaping independent creator earnings, MetaSkins proposes a fresh platform in Decentraland. This space will allow for gamified mature NPC's, and be an untapped platform for creators to present mature content and develop NSFW gamified experiences. Our edge? We're free from centralized constraints, granting creators unmatched monetization freedom in the metaverse. Importantly, 15% of our profits will support the DCL DAO. We're keen to prove this endeavor's potential.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n71,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe4AfC24B8dba77C4dFBCc9FAB236d0C4701D06fc\n\n## Email address\n\nDavid@metaskins.com\n\n## Description\n\nIntroducing Pixxxel: Welcome to Pixxxel, the next frontier in the adult entertainment realm within the metaverse. This revolutionary platform, designed exclusively for an audience above 18, encapsulates five cornerstone pillars: renders, gamification, content, partnerships, and immersive events.\n\nRenders: MetaSkins, renowned for its collaborations with illustrious brands such as Puma, Etro, BBC News, and NBC News, brings its expertise to Pixxxel. The avatars you'll encounter span a spectrum: from hyper-realistic figures exuding sexuality to whimsical, animated sexual characters, each personifying roles like dancers or hosts. What sets them apart? The meticulous design to make these avatars as real feeling as possible, as well as an experienced animation team utilizing different styles including motion-capture techniques that translate real-life movements into the virtual world. Envision public viewing arenas, complete with stages and dancing poles, transitioning to exclusive upstairs private rooms, each endowed with video streaming potential. Witness the potential of Decentraland in this ambit. For a more tangible preview, our mock-up offers an enticing sneak-peek. (This mock up does not yet have the functionality but is a beta to show the beginnings of the experience).\n\nGamification: Pixxxel transcends the stereotypical online adult offerings by infusing intricate game mechanisms. As users engage, they unlock higher tiers of experiences. Yearn for the VIP echelons? Navigate through a labyrinth of interactive challenges meticulously crafted by MetaSkins with invaluable community feedback. By merging eroticism with gaming, we aim to draw users into Decentraland, not just for the explicit content but for a holistic, immersive experience.\n\nContent: Pixxxel is a treasure trove of diverse adult content. From NSFW metaverse-special videos, intimate live cam engagements, to AI-powered and human-driven chats, we've got it all. A standout feature? Our chat interfaces will be built to retain memory, paving the path for users to cultivate a continuous, evolving bond with avatars. It's not just about fleeting encounters but about creating lasting narratives.\n\nPartnerships: Our mission is to curate unparalleled content. To realize this, we have discussed joined forces with stellar adult entertainers, renowned production houses, and loved OnlyFans icons. This confluence promises to steer passionate followers from various platforms right into the heart of Decentraland's metaverse. The rhythm of events, curated weekly and monthly, hosted by these industry mavens, ensures consistent user engagement. A special mention: our relationship with Bellesa, an epitome of ethically-curated, women-empowered adult content. Their advisory role ensures Pixxxel is at the forefront of ethical, inclusive adult entertainment.\n\nEvents: Bi-weekly events are Pixxxel's pulse. In collaboration with adult creators and Decentraland's vibrant communities, we aim to craft myriad experiences. Brands have the opportunity to embed themselves, further enriching the Pixxxel universe.\n\nIn Gratitude: A nod to DCL DAO's unwavering faith in us, we earmark 15% of Pixxxel's profits for them. Our shared dream? To sculpt a metaverse unparalleled in its freedom and innovation.\n\nFinal Note: DCL has unmatched potential but needs better content. Pixxxel offers immersive adult entertainment, blending avatar design & gamification. Our partnerships & events prioritize ethics and inclusivity.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMonth 1:\n❖ Build 6-8 UNIQUE dancer/host/bartender avatars with unique identities (strippers/dancers)\n❖ Build out specific dances and movements for each avatar (using Rokoko motion-capture\ntools)\n❖ Secure commitment from specific adult entertainers to produce exclusive\nmetaverse-gated content\n❖ Begin build out payment functionality for Pixxxel entrance fee, tipping dancers,\npurchasing drinks, purchasing 1on1 time with creators etc.\n\nMonth 2:\n❖ Onboard live humans to control the avatars working at Pixxxel for Pixxxel events\n❖ Seek partnerships and/or branded events within DCL community\n❖ Build out customized branding and experiences for first events\n❖ Build out Pixxxel’s rank system\n❖ Build out custom real-life Only Fans model avatars of the entertainers to represent them\nin Decentraland\n❖ Build out the functionality of dancers to enable user interaction (lap dances, offering\ntokens, sexual acts)\n\nMonth 3:\n❖ Begin development for rank-building interactive games (treasure hunts and more)\n❖ Secure partnerships with other DCL communities for parts of the rank-building games\n❖ Begin development of exclusive status-gated experiences and scenes\n❖ Train AI chat-bots to emulate these entertainers for AI flirt-bot feature\n❖ Build out chat features and funnels to communicate with LIVE CAM Only Fans representatives from within the DCL Worlds scene\n❖ Partner with different adult entertainers as hosts for events\n❖ Schedule next 3-4 months of bi-weekly DCL community events\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

And then also, for the winning builders, to guide them in their builds to make sure their builds have a high probability of being successful for both users and for brands.\n\nMCF will also coordinate to offer free land for the builders that MCF funds.\n\nThe process for creators to get funded will require them to fill out a detailed application.\n\nApplications meeting the requirements will then be reviewed by a jury comprised of DCL experts (Maryana, JamesA, Lastraum, and MetaDoge) in tandem with metaverse marketing experts outside of DCL\n\nThe jury will then select what it feels are the best of the applications to get funded.\n\nThe average abound funded will be around $20,000\n\nThe visionaries on the jury will then be hands-on in helping to guide the builds through each tranche\n\nOnce an experience has been completed it will then be promoted to the marketing community at large, so that any agency, etc. will have the opportunity to deploy it for their brands.\n\nAll activations for every experience funded will end up providing funds back to the DAO.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nLaunching the Metaverse Creators Fund website:   This milestone is crucial as it sets the foundation for the project and allows potential creators to learn about the opportunity. (45 days)  15/10 - 30/11\n\nMarketing Activities: To attract talented creators, we will initiate comprehensive marketing efforts across various platforms and channels. By effectively promoting the fund, we aim to reach a wide audience of potential applicants and encourage them to participate. 1/11 - 30/11\n\nOpening Application Call:  After the marketing efforts, we will open the application process for creators to submit their innovative ideas. 1/12 - 15/12\n\nJury Evaluation:  Once the application period is closed, we will assemble a diverse and knowledgeable jury to evaluate the submitted ideas. The jury will have 2 weeks to carefully review and score each proposal based on pre-defined criteria. 16/12- 30/12\n\nFinancing the First Batch:  Upon completion of the jury evaluation, we aim to support 2 ideas in this initial phase. 1/01 - 7/01\n\nBuilding the Funded Experience:  Each selected creator will be given a timeframe of 60 days to develop and build their funded experience in the DCL. We will provide guidance and support throughout this process to ensure the successful realization of their projects. 7/01 - 7/03\n\nWe will actively host community calls to engage with stakeholders and discuss our progress openly. Additionally, regular reporting will be a fundamental aspect of our project.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xe1eedbd1e08478707c794e7e8b1ee623f5fa6d64 (AwedJob)\n\nShould the following $30,000 grant in the Documentation category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAn informed and educated user base is happier and more productive. We will create comprehensive, current, and understandable educational content about Decentraland for users of a variety of skill levels.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n30,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n10 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x7e1dc48c710c791255f297b912dd5940212c7e33\n\n## Email address\n\nDecentralEducation@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nTalented, competent creators who don’t know the specific people with the accurate, cryptic answers they need become frustrated and leave Decentraland. Dedicated, long-time Decentralites who have waited in vain for essential documentation have already begun to leave. Current documentation is inconsistent and incomplete. It takes a long time to track down relevant, current and functional information. Decentral Ed, Canessa and AwedJob, with 18 years of teaching experience combined, will help more people faster, and more effectively with up-to-date information located in one place, and updated frequently.\n\nDecentral Ed will look at existing public questions, and we will ask people about their gaps in understanding during twice monthly “DEd Reckoning” sessions (“open knowledge” discussions held in the DEd.dcl.eth world using DCL Cast) to find out what people need to know. We will then create documentation addressing these topics.\n\nWe will deliver subject specific, cross-standard, information in text form located in one authoritative place. An online document can be more easily updated and maintained than a soon to be outdated “how to video”. Our documents may also be printed, making them readily available when you are away from your computer as well. Text is easily queried, referenced, and digested by search engines and large language model A.I.\n\nDecentral Ed will separate documents into three standards, update them regularly, and ensure their accuracy. These standards are: Governance, Social and Development. We will write documentation for people at the novice and advanced beginner levels. These are the first two of five different skill levels: novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, and expert. We feel that there is an existing body of proficient and expert level documentation. We will not be creating documentation for those top two skill levels.\n\nDecentral Ed will produce a minimum of 200 documents over the course of 2,000 work hours during a period of ten months. The subject matter for these documents will come from DEd Reckoning sessions and from existing unanswered questions found on Discord servers, Reddit posts, GitHub repos, and StackOverflow posts. We will fill existing gaps like “how to rotate a scene in SDK7” and “Deploying multiple video screens from one m3u8 video stream.” The “DEd Reckoning” sessions will begin as twice monthly sessions but may increase to twice weekly sessions as schedules allow. These will be streamed live inside DEd.dcl.eth using DCL Cast, streamed to Kick, and uploaded to YouTube for archival purposes.\n\nBy the time we submitted our proposal in the third quarter, there were other, previously submitted proposals in the Documentation category. With their passage the remaining budget for this category was $9,000. Our proposal was therefore considered outside of budget. This proposal is our re-submission at the start of the fourth quarter. Recent changes have required AwedJob to take a full-time teaching position. This is why the project duration has been increased to 10 months. Both Canessa and AwedJob will only be able to commit a few hours a week during their full-time jobs. The Roadmap and Milestones have been edited to reflect this.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nSeptember:\n2 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 29 hours\n\nOctober:\n3 documents, 2 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 48.5 hours\n\nNovember:\n6 documents, 2 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 69 hours\n\nDecember:\n6 documents, 2 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 69 hours\n\nJanuary:\n22 documents, 2 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 197 hours\n\nFebruary:\n22 documents, 2 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 197 hours\n\nMarch:\n22 documents, 2 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 197 hours\n\nApril:\n22 documents, 2 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 197 hours\n\nMay:\n22 documents, 2 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 197 hours\n\nJune:\n30 documents, 8 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 324 hours\n\nJuly:\n30 documents, 8 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 324 hours\n\nAugust:\n15 documents, 3 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 151.5 hours\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

We pride ourselves on our integration with the Decentraland platform and aim to foster that growth throughout our journey to create an interoperable game for anyone of any play style to enjoy. Racers can collect materials or win competitions to claim a Skin/Helmet Wearable NFTs that are paired with a matching Vehicle. Racers can also earn Vehicle Mods NFTs as well to decorate their vehicles. Expanding even more the self-identity expression. Vroomway is also a club for those who prefer a more socialized experience with our night club The Recharge. Whatever your play style is Vroomway is sure to have a zone just for you.\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/AHIKxjD.png)\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n93,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4b99aD2Fad8B5553dc734EDA80695591b3CA1fD5\n\n## Email address\n\nvroomwayracing@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nThis funding will allow us to stay compliant with the new Decentraland guidelines regarding the sunset of SDK 6 and migration to SDK 7. Here in a few months, the Decentraland Foundation will stop updating components in SDK 6 and only focusing on SDK 7. The rewrite from SDK 6 to SDK 7 is huge. Not only will we be in compliance with the standard, but our scene will perform ten-fold how it does now thanks to the amazing new SDK 7 components. This will also allow us to scale significantly easier and come much closer to sustainability.\n\nPreviously, we open sourced our robust Inventory and Leveling systems (in SDK 7) for the community and plan to open source every component of our game. We aim to provide plug-and-play repositories for anyone to use in their game. We know the hurdle of starting a new game from scratch and we want to help bridge that as much as we can. These open source pieces will be available through the Decentraland Awesome Repository just like the first set was. Being able to create new features will allow us to open source even more game components.\n\nWith this migration we will be able to make the following items SDK 7 compatible and open source:\n\n*   3 Game Modes\n*   20 Scenes\n*   Vehicle System\n*   Leveling System (done)\n*   Inventory System (done)\n*   Vehicle Mods (cosmetic attachments)\n*   Gathering System\n*   Loot System\n*   Reward System\n*   Crafting system\n*   Material Shop (buy & sell materials)\n*   2D UI (extremely robust and dynamic)\n*   FUEL Purchase (on-parcel MANA transactions)\n*   Dynamic NPCs\n*   Timer & Timed Systems\n*   Infinity Engine (used by multiple projects in the community)\n\nThis will also allow us to continue to deliver a game people enjoy playing and stimulate the economy. Players have sold their Skins they earned for free for hundreds and hundreds of MANA. We've stimulated the Decentraland economy with over 14,000+ MANA in mint/secondary sales combined. We've had single skins sell for up to 400 MANA on secondary.\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tfa6FhD.png)\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/rQVRHG7.png)\n\nWe have many features we want to introduce (and open source) such as:\n\n*   New Game Mode: Balloon Heist\n*   New Game Mode: Bumper Cars\n*   Battle Pass\n*   Professions: Gathering & Mileage\n*   Optional AI Opponents in Game Modes\n*   20 Additional Vehicles (Skin or Helmet Wearables)\n*   New Missions: Daily, Weekly, Events\n    Plus many more collaborations and events!\n\nIn case you missed it, here is a video we made for a Town Hall update in June. We've done a lot more since this video too!\n\n**January23 - June23 Recap!**\nhttps://vimeo.com/838165839/e78f5fde5c?share=copy\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/y2wIVnl.png)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Month 1-3: SDK 7 Migration & Scene Update**\nWe will migrate all of our current systems over to the new SDK 7 framework. This will bring a new scene as well since we've expanded our 4x4 estate to a 6x4 estate courtesy of the Foundation. This will include a refactor of 3 static scenes and 17 game mode scenes. This involves extensive front-end and back-end programming as well as setting up new server systems.\n\n**Month 4-6: New Features and Game Modes**\nWe will develop and integrate our new features and vehicles to craft and claim. Integrate the new game modes and begin open sourcing every major component of our game for others to use. Focusing on increasing user retention and playability for the game. We will also host our third annual Grand Prix for the whole Decentraland Community to enjoy.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x538ce85ccf6080cec960bc5341787691217c4d97 (Johnny)\n\nShould the following $111,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis is a continuation of the CROSSVERSE project by DAPPCRAFT. Our focus is on working with traffic in metaverses and attracting players to locations.\n\nWe built a smart wearable called Hyp-0 which is kind of a key for players to CROSSVERSE ecosystem within metaverses.\n\n![Hyp-0](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/cv/1.gif)\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n111,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xf49056577a9266cd6CFd1B8f6ac151D9BB3671d7\n\n## Email address\n\njohnny.k@dapp-craft.com\n\n## Description\n\n### Here are our major achievements:\n\n![Hyp-0](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/cv/2.1-600.png)\n\n*   As part of our previous grant goals in February 2023, we conducted alpha tests of the Exploration mode (Single-player) with great success. We received a lot of positive feedback from the community. 12 players completed 400 quests. The six landowners got 400 visits to their locations.\n    Full report https://t.ly/NuK9E and update in Twitter https://twitter.com/crossverse_xvrs/status/1622597579111387137\n\n*   In August 2023, we were the first to release smart wearables on the Decentraland marketplace, and everything sold out within hours.\n\n*   In September 2023 we launched a Tournament mode (Multiplayer mode, a PvP gameplay). It's a multiplayer tactical-strategic action game in augmented reality format, the first of its kind in Decentraland. You should see these battles! Players can build their networks and hack other player’s networks.\n\nPlayers spent **100s of hours** playing, built **29 521** nodes, and made **62 435** connections. This is only with 30 unique active players during two weeks' time. The tournament exceeded all our expectations in terms of player engagement. Therefore, we've decided to delve deeper into its improvement.\n\nWatch the video for a gameplay explanation. https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xyslsh3eNcQ?si=L478rq-EtqOPcoX5\n\nAnd 6 hours (!!!) stream by one of the players on Twitch - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwP8XudSi38\n\n#### Social proofs\n\n![Hyp-0](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/cv/social.gif)\n\n### Use Case\n\nWe run tournaments on different locations in Decentraland on maps with different sizes. This is what the latest map looks like. Different colors are different players. Dot’s - flag user placed and connections between dots are links.\n\n![Hyp-0](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/cv/screen.jpg)\n\nPeople build networks, hack other networks, and explore the territory while playing. One of the locations we did the tournament was the Consensys. Players got engaged with the scene and received cool wearables.\nThis is how CROSSVERSE brings traffic to the Decentraland’s locations.\n\n![Hyp-0](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/cv/loc.gif)\n\n### Next steps\n\n*   PvP & Exploration improvements\n    We take a constant lean approach to developing and testing new features with quick release. We plan to constantly sync with the community and implement/remove PvP features based on feedback.\n*   Tokenomics\n*   Laboratory Front end and Back end\n    Upgrade Hyp-0 rarity and visual elements. Below you can see our concept for visual skins, but as we have to do with reality - DCL SDK has not allowed us to do it exactly as we want so it will be simpler but still we and our community love and want skins! :)\n\n![Hyp-0](https://instaverse-grant.s3.amazonaws.com/cv/skins.png)\n\n### Project path\n\n![Hyp-0](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/E-Yo5miolqhC-oSU8HTLjf8bb3uVg0LXIyLm4CPY3e8mtEmMlMb3rMUNhXmALYSY-Bc=w2400)\n\nThis project has gone through a challenging journey. Our grant was frozen a few months after the start due to uncertainties with the release of smart wearables by the Decentraland Foundation. Miraculously, we managed to retain the core team and continue the project until the grant was unfrozen.\nThis affected our original roadmap, where we had to change priorities and sacrifice some goals\n\nOur previous grant ends on October 31st, and we need funding to continue bringing our metaverse dreams and vision to life for all of you.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n*   Milestone 1: (1 Dec)\n    *   Hyp-0 extension - 1 mini app\n    *   PvP: Utility updates (map, etc.)\n    *   PvP: Mainnet release and tests\n*   Milestone 2: (1 month after)\n    *   PvP: Design renovation\n    *   PvP: in-game tutorials integration\n    *   PvP: First mainnet tournament\n*   Milestone 3: (1 month after)\n    *   Exploration: improvements & upgrades\n    *   Exploration: in-game tutorials\n    *   PvP: perk/upgrades integration and FX\n*   Milestone 4: (1 month after)\n    *   HUB: Location deploy\n    *   Hyp-0 laboratory: Rarity upgrade with tokens\n    *   Hyp-0 extension: mini-apps update\n*   Milestone 5: (1 month after)\n    *   PvP: token incentivization\n    *   Exploration: token incentivization\n    *   PvP: Second mainnet tournament\n*   Milestone 6: (1 month after)\n    *   Hyp-0 laboratory: visual customization\n    *   Exploration: Upgrade of the routing system.

    "title": "Monster Hall Roguelike Game",
    "body": "> by 0xb7637542279e38fadbcdf7298aa381aafd157795 (MonsterHall)\n\nShould the following $120,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe mission of Monster Hall is to develop a diversified IP project on Decentraland. Focusing on gaming as its core, Monster Hall will additionally feature musical performances, art exhibitions, fashion showcases, and immersive virtual spaces. The first game to be launched by Monster Hall is an unpredictable roguelike game, where each section of the game offers players a unique experience. Leveraging the enhanced capabilities of SDK 7, Monster Hall will feature rich, original special effects and dynamic UI to elevate the Decentraland gaming experience and visual aesthetics to new heights.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n10 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xb7637542279e38fADBcDF7298aA381AAFd157795\n\n## Email address\n\nastorirwidin@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n### Background\n\nI joined Decentraland in late 2021, initially without any specialized development skills. Like many community members, I was attracted by the limitless possibilities of the Metaverse. Through learning the rich resources provided by the community, I gradually acquired a range of skills from 3D modeling to programming. I began to work on Monster Hall in my free time. During the SDK 6, I created a four-land scene and a four-land shooting game, which have not been released yet.  Due to various reasons, I had to make many compromises in the game development process. However, the release of SDK 7 and Worlds solved many challenges I was facing before and prompted me to fully transition to a new game project. During the development of the new project, I invited several members to join. We determined to achieve our goals and are pround to grow alongside Decentraland.\n\nI released the previous scene designs and game videos, as well as a demo for the new game. Although these works are still developing, they offer a preliminary showcase of Monster Hall’s artistic design and gameplay mechanics.\n\n![Scenes Image](https://monsterhall.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2023grant/2023GrantScenes.png)\n\n[Previous Game Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_1Gz0EhzwhA)\\\n[Previous Scene Demo](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=6%2C64)\\\n[New Game Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Uk8mtrWYw)\\\n[New Game Demo](https://play.decentraland.org/?NETWORK=mainnet\\&position=0,0\\&realm=monsterhall.dcl.eth)\n\n### Short-Term Plan\n\nWithin the framework of this proposal, our objective is to complete the alpha version of Monster Hall's game in the next ten months.\n\n*   3 Randomly generated maze maps with unique styles\n*   1 Battlefield designed specifically for a boss fight\n*   1 Mysterious hidden map\n*   40+ Multifunctional game items\n*   5 Different types of enemies\n*   1 Boss enemy\n*   15+ Unique player skills\n*   4 Weapons\n*   15+ Environment buffs\n*   10+ Player buffs\n\nWe will also introduce leaderboards to incentivize player engagement. In addition to game content, we plan to enhance Monster Hall's main scene through improving visual art, character designs, and feature optimizations. During Decentraland's MVFW in March 2024, we intend to construct an interactive stage within Monster Hall's main scene. This will provide high-quality content for community events and increase user traffic and visibility for Monster Hall. This will mark our first endeavor to integrate the Monster Hall IP with community events.\n\n### What Monster Hall Aims to Bring to Decentraland\n\nWe are dedicated to delivering games with exceptional artistic design and events to Decentraland. Monster Hall is more than just a game, it will also serve as an open IP within the Decentraland ecosystem. We aim to extend Monster Hall's influence to a broader audience, attracting more users to Decentraland and encouraging them to stay in this imaginative virtual world for the long term. Through ongoing community engagement, strategic partnerships, and high-quality content, we aim to make Monster Hall an important symbol in the Decentraland community.\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MetaMonsterHall)\\\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/XDYkEvNqZA)\\\n[Wearables\\&Emotes](https://market.decentraland.org/accounts/0xb7637542279e38fadbcdf7298aa381aafd157795?section=collections)\n\n![Characters Image](https://monsterhall.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2023grant/2023GrantCharacters.png)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n***2023***\n\n*   ***October - November: Refine Monster Combat System and Game Items***\\\n    Will focus on refining and optimizing the monster combat systems and game items which are crucial for player character progression.\n*   ***December: Refine Environment Buffs and Player Buffs***\\\n    Will focus on environment and player buffs to increase the complexity of the game and offer dynamic challenges.\n\n***2024***\n\n*   ***January: Main Scene Construction***\\\n    The main scene will serve as the visual core of Monster Hall and will be the future hub for player social interaction and community events.\n*   ***February: First Event Production in Conjunction with MVFW***\\\n    Will prepare for an event related to Decentraland's MVFW, including wearables and virtual fashion shows related to Monster Hall IP.\n*   ***March: MVFW Event and Refine Weapon System***\\\n    The MVFW event will take place.

    "title": "Expanding Decentraland Explorers: Mobile & VR in Godot and Desktop in Bevy",
    "body": "> by 0x83f9192d59b393c8789b55d446e5d4a77075c820 (Lean)\n\nShould the following $218,200 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAfter the goals achieved in the Protocol Squad we want to present this proposal which aims to advance the Decentraland metaverse by developing mobile clients with the Godot engine, targeting Android and iOS platforms, with the potential to publish on App Store and Play Store and by continuing the development of the Bevy engine's desktop client, thereby indirectly contributing to the Godot project, while also preparing for desktop client deployment.\n\nOn the other hand, we want to keep making contributions to Decentraland's documentation, and collaboration work with the Foundation. Crucially, we want to develop test scenes in-house to ensure the compatibility, completeness, and uniformity of SDK7 implementation across all client platforms.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n218,200 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x04812c531083054863ef354EF600A61857921466\n\n## Email address\n\nleangodotdev@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nIn our continuous efforts to propel Decentraland into the forefront of the decentralized metaverse, we propose a comprehensive plan with primary and secondary objectives to enhance the user experience, expand the reach of Decentraland's client base, and contribute to the ecosystem's growth.\n\n### Primary Objectives:\n\n*   **Godot Mobile Clients (Android and iOS)**: Our foremost goal is to develop mobile clients for the Decentraland metaverse using the Godot engine. These clients will be tailored for Android and iOS platforms, with the potential for publication on the App Store and Play Store. This expansion aims to make Decentraland more accessible to a wider audience, providing a seamless and immersive experience on mobile devices.\n*   **Bevy Desktop Client Development**: In the short term, we will continue the development of the Decentraland Bevy engine's desktop client. By doing so, we indirectly contribute to the Godot project, as both engines share the Rust language, common goals, and development principles. This effort ensures that Decentraland has a robust desktop client, positioning it for future deployment on various desktop platforms.\n\n### Secondary Objectives:\n\n*   **User Experience Enhancement**: Central to our approach is prioritizing the user experience. We aim to create a user-friendly environment in which casual users can interact seamlessly with Web3, all without the need to manage a self-custodial wallet. Additionally, we will focus on enhancing user engagement within the virtual world, refining elements such as player locomotion, emotes, and other interactive features.\n*   **Test scenes**: Test scenes will be developed by our team to ensure the compatibility, completeness, and uniformity of SDK7 implementation across all the clients.\n*   **Documentation and Collaboration**: We are committed to maintaining and enhancing Decentraland's documentation. This includes contributions to documentation repositories and working closely with the Decentraland Foundation to address any unfinished tasks. Our goal is to ensure that users and developers have access to comprehensive and up-to-date resources for utilizing Decentraland's features and protocols.\n*   **SDK7 Enrichment** : We will actively participate in the growth and improvement of SDK7. Our contributions will involve refining the SDK, adding new features, and ensuring its compatibility with our client developments, thereby fostering a thriving Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, our proposal outlines a multifaceted approach to elevate Decentraland's metaverse experience. By expanding to mobile platforms with Godot, continuing Bevy's desktop client development, and focusing on user-centric enhancements, we aim to make Decentraland more accessible, engaging, and immersive for users and developers alike. Our commitment to documentation, collaboration, and SDK7 growth further solidifies Decentraland's position as a leading decentralized virtual world.\n\nNote: A new Staff Engineer was added to the proposal (in comparison with the previous one: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5d65f080-4eab-11ee-8775-751cfef3aca1) that will help with the Performance of the Mobile Version, and he's adding the possibility of doing a PoC of VR and an Experimental version for Web. This enables a more reliable and faster result in the Godot implementation\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### Milestone 1 - Jan 31st 2024\n\n*   Web3\n    *   Allow players to maintain an identity without an external wallet\n    *   Allow users to link an external wallet in the new explorers to establish a permanent identity\n    *   Provide a mechanism for signing transactions\n\n*   SDK completeness\n    minimal functional support for all non-deprecated SDK7 components and SDK API modules\n\n*   Compliance test scenes (\\*)\n\n### Milestone 2 - Apr 30th 2024\n\n*   Beta release\n    *   Mobile Explorer signed and available for iOS and Android\n    *   Desktop explorer signed available from decentraland.org\n\n*   Basic SDK6 support\n\n*   Alpha release\n    *   PoC native VR build (mainly Meta Quest 2)\n    *   Experimental web build\n\n*   Locomotion proposal\n    *   Specification for player locomotion\n    *   Implementation in the new explorers\n\n*   Compliance test scenes (\\*)\n\n(\\*) Detail of compliance test scene, component list:\n\n**Milestone 1**\n\n*   Transform\n*   MeshRenderer\n*   Material\n*   Visibility\n*   Billboard\n*   Raycast\n*   GltfContainer\n*   Animator\n*   TextShape\n*   EngineInfo\n*   CameraMode\n*   PointerEvents\n*   PointerLock\n\n**Milestone 2**\n\n*   AvatarAttach\n*   AudioSource\n*   AudioStream\n*   VideoPlayer\n*   UiTransform\n*   UiCanvasInformation\n*   UiBackground\n*   UiLabel\n*   UiText\n*   UiInput\n*   UiInputResult\n*   UiDropdown\n*   UiDropdownResult\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Operational since last October and having hosted around 50 successful shows and concepts, The Saloon is the focal point of this $65,000 grant request, aiming for operational continuity and the introduction of a far-west oriented shooting game.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n65,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x3C0dABC82bf51d1bf994a54E70e7a7d19865f950\n\n## Email address\n\nbufalomanagement@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nBufalo has been a trendsetter in the Decentraland community, paving the way for artists and community leaders in terms of marketing, event communication, community engagement, and performance ethics. Achieving several milestones: \n\n*   Over 250 individual shows. \n\n*   The Metaverse Tour with Radio FG, featuring the Metazoo, TRU, the Nyan Cat, DollHouse and The Sugar Club, exposing Decentraland to Radio’s FG’s 2 million monthly listeners over 3 months via live dj sets and radio liners.  \n\n*   The very first artist to bridge Decentraland into real-life major NFT conferences like NFT Paris in early 2022 with the Sugar Club and Blockdown Festival in Croatia and Portugal, live at TRU.   - Performed for successful activations of major actors such as 20 Minutes, Doritos, regular dj of reknown brands such as Decentral Games, Polygonal Mind, Metagellan  - Launched the Saloon since October, hosting regular successful concepts and events, bringing the community together around the far west culture  \n\n*   Being the first DJ touring the web3 space IRL (NFT Paris, Croatia, Portugal, London, NFT Factory Paris for Deadfellaz) spreading his implication in Decentraland by any way possible (stickers, performances, IRL wearable gifts)\n\n  - One of the very first artist that has successfully created a web3 community, federated thru concerts, wearable experiences and a unique passion for the western culture, that he’s about to travel the other side of the world to meet in just a few days, over United States, via community meeting in 4 different states.   \n\n*   The BOTV Skull, the main music NFT project, which offers exclusive futuristic far-west oriented Decentraland wearables each 2 months and more benefits.  \n\n*   Since beginning of 2023, Bufalo has also been approached by several students from different business schools from Paris to provide insights on the future of discoverability, and community engagement 3.0. \n\nWhy Funding is Needed: \nThis grant specifically aims to maintain and further expand The Saloon activities, which has been operational since October and has hosted about 60 successful shows. The Saloon fills a niche otherwise left unfilled, by providing real-world artists a place to showcase their skills. The Saloon successfully blends real world talent such as AwedJob's dancing and Isa's bellydancing skills, or Ken Carter’s universe into a multi-faceted experience. The funds will support various aspects of Bufalo’s activities including new equipment, budget for booking IRL artist to onboard their communities, as well as for the current Saloon’s performers, and have a salary for the Saloon activities for the team and Bufalo, for their work for a year.  including the development of a new far-west oriented shooting game on adjacent lands.  \n\nThe tremendous list of event Bufalo has performed at for 2022 - 23, including the Saloon’s programmation : \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/9hgoissfteuh99d368w4h/h?rlkey=wrinzrahkgkbvjiv0ninn96la\\&dl=0  \n\n Proof Of Concept: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ta2o5ntzre56qz8681t31/h?rlkey=1iavdgm49l6ze4db5afpr9882\\&dl=0\n\nMedia and Press Attention:\nBufalo’s commitment into Decentraland has received attention from major French press outlets like 20 Minutes, Cryptoast, Clubbing TV, Radio FG, and Le Journal du Coin.

    "body": "> by 0x10ac7f99a186b4e382c1af547029772e4557ffaf (Bat)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Add an erc721C NFT collection to DCL Marketplace for launch also giving a 2.5% exchange rate to DAO of all sales on DCL Market Place](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=96223140-5572-11ee-9f04-6f45955e15fe)\n\n## Summary\n\nAdd an erc721C NFT collection to DCL Marketplace for launch also giving a 2.5% exchange rate to DAO of all sales on DCL Market Place\\\nTHIS IS NOT A GRANT WE ARE REQUESTING a grant from DECENTRALAND DAO\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nAdd an erc721C NFT collection to DCL Marketplace for launch also giving a 2.5% exchange rate to DAO of all sales on DCL Market Place. The 10k NFT collection has already been approved to be linked wearables through this DOA.\n\nWhat is ERC721C and why care?\nLong story short majority NFT 10k ETH collections are made on ERC721A and sadly Blur Marketplace found an exploit where they can not enforce the royalties to creatures. Thus now OpenSea and all other Marketplaces are now saying they will also pivot to no longer enforcing royalties for sales. Some people saw value in royalties being one of the biggest utilities in the art space since they we have seen continued to give funds to expand the IP of the collections instead of them just being a one of sale like in real life art. ERC721C we have tested gives the power to the creatures to turn off and on permissions to marketplaces at anytime that do not enforce the royalties thus giving the power back to the creatures again. We will be the first NFT collection to pioneer this new method and would love to promote our buyers, fans and collectors to buy off marketplaces that enforce the 10% royalties like Decentraland Marketplace rather since we will be turning off permissions like Blur unless they later on agree to enforce those 10% royalties. We also think since our NFTs will be linked in Decentraland and for those of you that know me know my long love for the Decentraland pretty much since its creation many years ago.\n\n\\--\nWhen launch? In the next week or so this month or next at latest we still testing ERC721C.\n\nA a great place is what we seek to launch why we here.\n\nI been a fan for a long time as those who know me know.\n\nFor reasons we all know why.\n\nU and i all know why I can't reveal my true identity.\n\nMethods like these are necessary when whales tread for attack.\n\nOnly we know we can outsmart them.\n\nName of this collection you ask is laid out right here in case you wondering from top to bottom on the left is the answer you seek.\n\nGenerally hate methods like this but we all know this place has become a circus.\n\nEgo's, comedians, leaches, blind dogs, thief's, digital colonizers, bears, clowns, and crabs in buckets.\n\nNever giving up tho as we know since even they can't stop us against our inevitable Liberty and Prosperity.\n\n2 now and forever. Thank you.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n1 so that when people buy the (NFT COLLECTION NAME ABOVE) they can also check out other wearables from other creators to go with there outfit\n2\\. So Decentraland can make that 2.5% marketplace fee and give it to do the DAO for all sales.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe have reached out to Nwiz, Sannin and Chedderqueso on why they voted invalid and asked what we can add to make valid yet have not received a clear response or instructions on how to solve that issue. We are open to all feedback from them and anyone else to be implemented thank you!\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThanks again for everyone that voted last round and this round again. Very stoked on this!\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Legal Consulting for Decentraland DAO",
    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (WebMoney)\n\nShould the problem/opportunity outlined be refined and taken to the next level?\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nDespite the decentralized nature of DAOs, they are not immune to traditional laws and regulations. Thus, for the successful and sustainable development of the DAO, it is necessary to understand the legal risks and legal consequences of DAO actions. Many participants in the Decentraland DAO are unclear about the legal implications of their activities, including property rights, legal obligations, and potential liabilities.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nEngage a legal consultant or company specializing in incorporating DAOs, legal entities, virtual property rights and assets. This consultancy would help Decentraland DAO to:\n\n*   Conduct a comprehensive legal risk assessment, analyzing our DAO's activities to identify potential legal vulnerabilities and offering solutions to mitigate them, ensuring the protection of both the DAO and its members.\n\n*   Understand the full spectrum of pros and cons concerning DAO incorporation.\n\n*   Investigate potential jurisdictions that are most favorable for DAOs, considering their regulatory environment and any associated benefits.\n\n*   Determine the level of asset protection, added responsibilities, and potential tax implications post-incorporation.\n\n*   Develop a legal structuring blueprint, map out potential legal structures that align with our DAO's goals and operational needs. For instance, as part of our legal structuring blueprint, the Decentraland DAO can create specialized sub-DAOs. These sub-entities can adopt formal legal structures like corporations for specific functions such as growth, investment initiatives, and grants management. As one of the possible options to consider, this can be achieved without the need to incorporate the main Decentraland DAO itself.\n\nThis pitch serves as a **starting point** to address identified issues, **setting the stage for detailed solutions and a clearer vision of Community needs** and what the execution teams should propose during the tender and bidding stages.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\n**Land, MANA, Names, and other asset owners:** These stakeholders need to be educated on the legal framework governing their digital assets, allowing them to better understand their legal rights for ownership, transfer, and management, as well as their responsibilities to comply with regulations.\n\n**Developers and Creators:** Understanding the legal nuances, especially those related to Intellectual Property laws, is crucial to ensure that their creations and projects are built on a legally solid foundation, do not infringe upon any existing rights, and are adequately protected.\n\n**DAO Voters:** To engage responsibly in governance, voters must be aware of the legal implications of their decisions. A clear legal framework will help mitigate voter liability and ensure that their contributions are meaningful and compliant within both the digital and traditional legal landscapes.\n\n**Core Units:** To operate efficiently and effectively within a DAO structure that provides them with a clear roadmap of legal do's and don'ts, allowing them to focus on their primary responsibilities without legal uncertainties.\n\n**Grantees:** To ensure that grants received from the DAO are structured in compliance with applicable laws, minimizing the risk of unforeseen liabilities. Clear explanations will be provided about the legal aspects of grant terms and conditions, as well as guidance on tax obligations.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nSecuring a legal consultancy for Decentraland DAO is not just about compliance; it's about ensuring that the DAO is built on a solid foundation that can weather challenges, protect its stakeholders, and thrive in the evolving digital world.\n\nHaving proper legal guidance, Decentraland DAO can interact seamlessly with traditional systems, whether it's entering contracts, acquiring assets, or securing partnerships, which would broaden opportunities and future prospects.\n\n**Legal Risks:** This is relevant because there are real legal risks associated with DAO activities. To ensure long-term stability and success of the DAO, it's essential to clearly understand these risks and their potential consequences for all DAO participants.\n\n**Asset Protection:** Decentraland, being a virtual world with a tradeable currency (MANA), involves significant asset transfers and value creation. Legal consultancy ensures that the ownership, transfer, and utilization of these assets are protected and compliant with current laws.\n\n**Understanding Benefits:** With the growth and development of the DAO, there arises a need to understand the potential benefits of DAO incorporation. For instance, incorporation can provide additional asset protection, strengthen the legal position of the DAO in relation to third parties, and offer a higher level of trust among members and partners.\n\n**Rapidly Evolving Regulatory Environment:** Governments and legal bodies globally are increasingly turning their attention to decentralized entities, such as DAOs, with the intent to regulate them. Without proper legal guidance, Decentraland DAO risks inadvertently violating new regulations, which could have significant repercussions.\n\n**Increasing Interactions with Traditional Entities:** As DAO expands its reach, there could be inevitable interactions with traditional businesses, organizations, and financial institutions. To forge partnerships, collaborations, or even simple transactions, a clear legal standing is crucial.\n\n**Future-Proofing:** As the digital landscape continues to change, Decentraland DAO needs to be ahead of the curve, anticipating potential legal challenges and addressing them proactively. This forward-thinking approach ensures the DAO's resilience and adaptability in a shifting environment.\n\n**Globalization:** As Decentraland aims to be a global platform, understanding international law and cross-border regulations is more important than ever.\n\n**Legal Plan:** Considering the above aspects, as well as the complexity and uniqueness of Decentraland DAO's operations, it's imperative to devise a comprehensive legal plan. This plan should take into account all potential risks, opportunities, and strategic decisions to ensure an optimal and resilient future for the DAO.\n\nGiven these considerations, it's important for the Decentraland DAO to invest in this initiative to ensure its continued growth, the protection of its members, and to solidify its position as a leader in the decentralized world.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x2684a202a374d87bb321a744482b89bf6deaf8bd (FriskyBumbleBee)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Integrate UI Parameters to Provide Grantee Details for an Active Grant Proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e94a2db0-549f-11ee-ae55-7d6b1ff3d1b5)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to assist in making better informed decisions for an active grant through the DAO.  Adding certain parameters to the grant details, may assist voters to view any previous lines of efforts the grantee have been involved in.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nBy adding UI/UX parameters to show the numbers of grants received, number of grants proposed, number of grants revoked, and total amount funded (with links to the proposals) this may aid in making better informed and sound decisions in the DAO. Voters will have the opportunity to see previous lines of efforts the grantee may have been involved in and make the determination along with their pitch to whether they should either vote Yes or No for the proposal.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO Grants program is a unique line of effort which provides financial capital to grow their respective business or line of efforts which will also result in the growth of the platform. By enabling creators and builders through this line of effort, it works in parallel by providing the financial capital to the grantee and building the platform. However, it proves difficult to track whether the grantee may or may have not been involved in other lines of efforts. This gap of information can also be addressed by word of mouth, or by researching on previous grants that have been passed which may be a burden for voters who may have a time constraint. Many times, an individual may not be aware the grantee had received funding or made numerous proposals in the past unless another senior community member may have brought it to their attention. By incorporating the proposed parameters, it will bolster voters to execute sound decisions based on the information highlighted through the parameters.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOnce a grant proposal has been submitted through the DAO and it becomes active, including additional details and with hyperlinks underneath the requesting amount such as:\n\n*   Display number of grants received in the past\n*   DIsplay number of grants proposed\n*   Display number of grants revoked\n*   Display total amount funded to the grantee\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nEnacting this governance proposal will increase transparency with grantees, permit ease of access to information for community members, and empower the community to make informed and sound decisions with the information provided.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n**Integration Difficulty - Low**\n\nBased on the feedback on Canny, the parameters already exists by clicking on an individuals profile. Integrating the parameters should not be a heavy lift. Below is the request submitted to Canny on 26 AUG 2023. The settings may be found by clicking on the individual’s profile.\n\n*   https://decentraland.canny.io/governance/p/incorporate-ui-parameters-highlighting-information-on-grantees-for-active-grant\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf approved, it will permit ease of access to the voters to execute and make sound decisions regarding active grant proposals without the burden of doing extensive research or clicking back and forth between individuals’ profiles and the proposal, which in turn will save time and assist in making sound decisions.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Reduce DAO expenses on Grants Program ",
    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (WebMoney)\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nProposal to decrease the percentage of MANA allocated from the vesting contract to the Grants Program, aiming to enhance the long-term financial stability of the Decentraland DAO.\n\n**ABSTRACT**\n\nThe Decentraland DAO has been granted a **[10-year vesting contract](https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac)** worth 222M MANA starting on Feb 19, 2020 which allows for a monthly vesting of 1.8M MANA to the DAO's Fund.\n\nCurrently, **[up to 70%](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bfab7b70-7b75-11ed-ad27-015f26e7c35c)** of the vested MANA is allocated to the Grants Program.\n\nThis proposal suggests reducing the percentage(%) of the vested MANA spent on Grants to strengthen the DAO's long-term financial health and to ensure sustainability after the vesting contract ends.\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\nThe Grants Program serves as a vital instrument for fostering the Decentraland ecosystem. However, growing concerns within the Community suggest that current spending on the Grants program is too high. This proposal aims to recalibrate the spending, ensuring the DAO's sustainability and reducing the risk of depleting funds with approximately 6.5 years remaining until the MANA vesting contract ends.\n\n**PROBLEM STATEMENT**\n\n*   DAO expenses consistently and significantly **[surpass](https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/)** its income.\n\n*   Big selling pressure exists on MANA, made both by the DAO and the Foundation.\n\n*   The DAO lacks diverse and stable revenue streams to offset its expenses.\n\n*   Current expenses inside the Grants Program appear inflated, necessitating clearer guidelines and greater accountability.\n\n**POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS**\n\n1.  Lower the percentage of vested MANA that is allocated to the Grants Program.\n\n2.  Reallocate the saved funds to enhance the DAO's financial stability.\n\nFor instance, establish a Sustainability Fund to insulate the Decentraland DAO from economic fluctuations, ensuring it can maintain both its long-term and short-term operations and plans, irrespective of wider economic conditions.\n\nThe Fund could be sourced from a combination of the MANA vesting contract, the Treasury, and ongoing income streams. The money in this fund will be reserved exclusively for DAO core operations, development, investments and strategic planning. It will be used to generate new revenue streams, such as staking or liquidity provision, or bolster existing ones and won't be allocated to the Grants Program.\n\n3.  Conduct a thorough analysis to align each grant category with the DAO's short-term and long-term objectives. Define strategic grants and priorities, such as the Platform category, and revise spending caps for each category based on a targeted strategy.\n\n4.  Create a decision-making framework for grants that raises the quality and accountability of the Grants Program.\n\nFor example, this framework could involve a specialized squad or committee that posts non-binding recommendations/opinions in the grant comments section. These recommendations would be based on a comprehensive set of evaluation criteria designed to ensure that each Grant proposal aligns with the DAO's strategic objectives and meets other relevant benchmarks for DAO’s standards. Here are some guiding questions the squad/committee could consider during the evaluation process as part of a decision-making framework for grants:\n\n*   Will this proposal benefit Decentraland and the DAO in the short and long term ?\n\n*   Are the project's goals aligned with those of Decentraland and the DAO ?\n\n*   Does the proposal provide concrete plans that will benefit Decentraland and the DAO ?\n\n*   Is the requested grant amount reasonable for achieving the goals outlined in the grant proposal and comparable with market rates and other grants ?\n\n*   Is the estimated timeframe for project completion realistic given the scope ?\n\n*   Does the grantee or project team possess the necessary skills and experience to successfully execute the project, based on available data and past performance ?\n\n*   How substantial is the project, and what contributions has it already made or is likely to make to Decentraland and the DAO, based on available data and plans ?\n\n**VOTING OPTIONS**\n\nYES: Reduce DAO expenses on Grants Program.\n\nNO: Leave as it is.\n\nThis is a non-binding pre-proposal poll designed to assess Community sentiment. If approved, a working group will be opened for wider discussions and inputs. Finalized points will be submitted in the next governance stages.\n\nShare your thoughts related to this proposal on the **[DAO Discord ](https://discord.gg/fKhfwjppDZ)** or in the comments.

    "title": "Make All Worlds Discoverable On Places dApp",
    "body": "> by 0x7a7280e299b79b7bd14d7501e3a03a0b77541622 (Monotributista)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Make All Worlds Discoverable On Places dApp](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8c779150-516f-11ee-a817-7dc33a6da5df)\n\n## Summary\n\nRemove restrictions on Worlds in Places dApp, initially implemented to uphold Genesis City's value. This proposal aims to make all Worlds discoverable through the Places dApp and the platform in general.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to address and reconsider the limitations currently imposed on Worlds within the Decentraland platform. These restrictions have ostensibly been put in place to maintain the value of land parcels within Genesis City. However, this practice contradicts the initial purpose of Worlds, which was to lower the barrier to entry and encourage a broader creator community. This proposal argues that the existing restrictions on Worlds do not enhance the value of Genesis City, and moreover, devalue the overall platform.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDespite the promising prospects Worlds offer, current limitations make them less useful than they could be. These restrictions include non-accessibility or being hidden from the broader Decentraland community. These limitations ostensibly exist to preserve the value and exclusivity of Genesis City land parcels, yet they conflict with the initial intent behind introducing Worlds.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Objective\n\nThe aim of this technical implementation is to amend the Places dApp within Decentraland to make all Worlds discoverable. The implementation encompasses several steps, including adjustments to specific queries and removal of unnecessary code.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n**Modify `findWorld` and `countWorlds` queries**: Upon review of the Places dApp repository, it is identified that removing the `AND hidden is false` condition from the [findWorld](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/entities/Place/model.ts#L494) and [countWorlds](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/entities/Place/model.ts#L542) queries would render all Worlds discoverable.\n\n**Remove `updateIndexWorlds` method**: This [method](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/entities/Place/model.ts#L410-L433) would now be redundant and should be removed from the codebase to eliminate unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Remove `processWorldsIndexing` task**: This [task](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/entities/World/task/processWorldsIndexing.ts) is called periodically and its purpose becomes obsolete once the [updateIndexWorlds](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/entities/Place/model.ts#L410-L433) method is removed.\n\n**Delete `hidden` column from schema**: With the removal of the aforementioned queries and methods, the [hidden column](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/entities/World/schemas.ts#L179-L182) in the database schema will no longer be required and should be eliminated.\n\n**Remove disclaimer regarding discoverability**: Any user-facing notices or alerts mentioning that some Worlds are not discoverable should be expunged from the UI, like [this one](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/pages/worlds.tsx#L192-L195) and its [translations](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/intl/en.json#L120).\n\n### Feedback\n\nFoundation developers and other experts within the community are encouraged to review these changes to ensure a comprehensive and error-free implementation.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThis implementation will make all Worlds available through the `https://place.decentraland.org/api/worlds` endpoint, which will result in them being discoverable through the Places dApp and any other interface consuming such API.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nAn initial pull request has been submitted to the `decentraland/places` repository,  to gather technical feedback from Foundation engineers regarding this governance proposal:\n\n*   [Pull Request #361](https://github.com/decentraland/places/pull/361)\n\nA subsequent PR would be needed to remove obsolete or unnecessary code, but this one would accomplish the purpose of making all Worlds discoverable through the Places dApp, and any other interface using the Places API.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe restrictions on Worlds neither enhance the value of Genesis City nor promote the core philosophy of Decentraland, which is decentralization and open participation. Removing these arbitrary limitations will likely result in a more engaged, dynamic, and valuable ecosystem for all stakeholders involved.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x1b46f75ac63bc57dfe82a374bdcdbfb08d125792\n\nShould the following $40,000 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe are writing a proposal for \"PCOS Connect,\" a groundbreaking immersive web app designed to support and educate women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a prevalent hormonal disorder affecting millions of women globally, impacting their physical and emotional well-being.\n\nPCOS Connect will provide a virtual environment where women with PCOS can access support, education, and resources tailored to their unique needs. The platform will offer virtual support groups, educational modules, telemedicine appointments, and lifestyle management tools. Each of these listed will be in the form of lands. The impacts this project will have are: Improved Quality of Life, Community Building and  Education\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n40,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n4 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x1B46F75aC63bc57DFE82A374bDCdbfB08d125792\n\n## Email address\n\namoweolubusayo@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe grant we are seeking will play a pivotal role in bringing the vision of \"PCOS Connect\" to life by facilitating the development and launch of Version 1 of this transformative project.\n\nA significant portion of the grant will be allocated to cover the development costs of the immersive web app. This includes software engineering, virtual environment design, and user interface development. With these funds, we will be able to assemble a skilled development team dedicated to crafting a user-friendly and technically robust platform. Building Version 1 of \"PCOS Connect\" is only the first step; we must also ensure that the platform reaches its intended audience. The grant will be allocated to marketing efforts aimed at raising awareness about the platform among women with PCOS and healthcare providers. This includes creating promotional materials, hosting awareness campaigns, and reaching out to relevant communities and organizations. For Decentraland, the project will serve as a compelling real-world example of how Decentraland can be applied to create meaningful and socially impactful solutions. This can enhance the reputation of Decentraland as a pioneer in fostering innovative applications of immersive technology. It can lead to increased interest in and adoption of Decentraland in the broader market.\n\nHere are the features of the platform:\n\n1.  Virtual Support Groups: Users can join or create virtual support groups within the metaverse. These groups would allow women with PCOS to connect with others facing similar challenges, share experiences, and provide emotional support.\n\n2.  PCOS Education Center: A virtual hub featuring interactive, immersive educational experiences about PCOS. Users can explore 3D models of ovaries, hormones, and other relevant structures, making it easier to understand the condition.\n\n3.  Nutritional Guidance: PCOS often involves dietary considerations. Users can access a virtual nutritionist who can provide personalized dietary advice within the metaverse. Virtual cooking classes and grocery shopping simulations can also be included.\n\n4.  Fitness and Exercise: Tailored virtual workout spaces with PCOS-friendly exercise routines and trainers specialized in PCOS-related fitness challenges. Users can engage in group workouts or individual sessions.\n\n5.  Meditation and Stress Management: Stress can exacerbate PCOS symptoms. Virtual meditation and relaxation spaces can help users manage stress through guided sessions or simply by providing tranquil environments for relaxation.\n\n6.  Health Tracking and Monitoring: Integrated health tracking tools to monitor menstrual cycles, ovulation, and other PCOS-related metrics. Users can visualize their data in graphs and receive insights and recommendations.\n\n7.  Telemedicine: Virtual appointments with gynecologists and endocrinologists specializing in PCOS. Users can consult with healthcare professionals from the comfort of their virtual environment.\n\n8.  PCOS Fashion and Style: A Virtual Wardrobe with PCOS-Friendly Fashion Tips and Style Guides Users can create and personalize avatars with clothing that helps them feel confident.\n\n9.

This document outlined the vision to refine the SDK to its ideal form - an open protocol for creating metaverse content-. This envisioned SDK would be open to any platform that chooses to adopt it, fostering collaboration and accessibility in the metaverse landscape.\n\nAfter months of dedicated effort, incorporating valuable community feedback during alpha and beta releases, [Foundation announced that SDK 7 is ready](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/announcing-sdk-7-beta).\nIn the current Grants Program Framework there's no requirement to the projects funded by the DAO to make the deliverables compatible with the latest version of the SDK, and this governance proposal is thought to update the documentation and make this a requirement.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal aims to make a new requirement for grants applications, to be added to the Grants Program Framework as follows:\n\n“The deliverables of projects funded by the DAO through the Grants Program should be built or compatible with the last stable Decentraland SDK.”\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nImplementing this requirement aligns grant projects more closely with the latest advancements in Decentraland's technology, fostering innovation and encouraging developers to leverage the capabilities of the most recent SDK version. This can lead to more efficient, secure, and feature-rich projects, ultimately enhancing the quality of the content.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nupdate grant program documentation. Specifically the requirements section.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis approach ensures that grant-funded projects align with the most current and robust technical standards, allowing for enhanced performance, integration, and overall quality.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The 10k NFT collection has already been approved to be linked wearables through this DOA.\n\nWhat is ERC721C and why care?\nLong story short majority NFT 10k ETH collections are made on ERC721A and sadly Blur Marketplace found an exploit where they can not enforce the royalties to creatures. Thus now OpenSea and all other Marketplaces are now saying they will also pivot to no longer enforcing royalties for sales. Some people saw value in royalties being one of the biggest utilities in the art space since they we have seen continued to give funds to expand the IP of the collections instead of them just being a one of sale like in real life art. ERC721C we have tested gives the power to the creatures to turn off and on permissions to marketplaces at anytime that do not enforce the royalties thus giving the power back to the creatures again. We will be the first NFT collection to pioneer this new method and would love to promote our buyers, fans and collectors to buy off marketplaces that enforce the 10% royalties like Decentraland Marketplace rather since we will be turning off permissions like Blur unless they later on agree to enforce those 10% royalties. We also think since our NFTs will be linked in Decentraland and for those of you that know me know my long love for the Decentraland pretty much since its creation many years ago.\n\n\\--\nWhen launch? In the next week or so this month or next at latest we still testing ERC721C.\n\nA a great place is what we seek to launch why we here.\n\nI been a fan for a long time as those who know me know.\n\nFor reasons we all know why.\n\nU and i all know why I can't reveal my true identity.\n\nMethods like these are necessary when whales tread for attack.\n\nOnly we know we can outsmart them.\n\nName of this collection you ask is laid out right here in case you wondering from top to bottom on the left is the answer you seek.\n\nGenerally hate methods like this but we all know this place has become a circus.\n\nEgo's, comedians, leaches, blind dogs, thief's, digital colonizers, bears, clowns, and crabs in buckets.\n\nNever giving up tho as we know since even they can't stop us against our inevitable Liberty and  Prosperity.\n\n2 now and forever.

Translating this document into an actual proposal proved to be a frustrating hinderance to my ability to represent the spirit and objectives of my proposal.\n\nBecause of the character limitation, I had to summarize certain parts of the proposal that led to misunderstandings around what was being offered.\n\nFor example, one part of the budget would cover the transaction fees to allow 1,000,000 transactions on the Polygon network, to help creators easily distribute free wearables and emotes at events without the technical skills to set up a server and write the code to do so. Due to the character limitation, at least one person who was not comfortable opening the PDF link boiled this offering down to \"25k USD to do a potential airdrop in the future\".\n\nI understand that we can't force people to read longer proposals either way and there will always be misunderstandings. But something I had not considered was the reasonable distrust for any external links within DAO proposals. I have since heard a few people say that they were told *never* to click links in the DAO, which is probably not bad advice.\n\nBy increasing the character limitation for grant proposals, we will reduce any need for proposals to direct people to supplementary websites or documents. It's not unreasonable to expect that projects asking for 6-figure budgets would have more than a few pages to write about their plan, and we should encourage as much information as possible being added directly to the text of the proposal.\n\n- Yes, double the character restrictions for Description and Roadmap\n- Yes, raise the character restriction, but not by that much.\n- Yes, raise the character restriction as high as possible\n- No, don't change anything\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x2684a202a374d87bb321a744482b89bf6deaf8bd (FriskyBumbleBee)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Integrate UI/UX Parameters to Provide Grantee Details for an Active Grant Proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f07f2400-4f31-11ee-8775-751cfef3aca1)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to assist in making better informed decisions for an active grant through the DAO.  Adding certain parameters to the grant details, may assist voters to view any previous lines of efforts the grantee have been involved in.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nBy adding UI/UX parameters to show the numbers of grants received, number of grants proposed, number of grants revoked, and total amount funded (with links to the proposals) this may aid in making better informed and sound decisions in the DAO. Voters will have the opportunity to see previous lines of efforts the grantee may have been involved in and make the determination along with their pitch to whether they should either vote Yes or No for the proposal.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO Grants program is a unique line of effort which provides financial capital to grow their respective business or line of efforts which will also result in the growth of the platform. By enabling creators and builders through this line of effort, it works in parallel by providing the financial capital to the grantee and building the platform. However, it proves difficult to track whether the grantee may or may have not been involved in other lines of efforts. This gap of information can also be addressed by word of mouth, or by researching on previous grants that have been passed which may be a burden for voters who may have a time constraint. Many times, an individual may not be aware the grantee had received funding or made numerous proposals in the past unless another senior community member may have brought it to their attention. By incorporating the proposed parameters, it will bolster voters to execute sound decisions based on the information highlighted through the parameters.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOnce a grant proposal has been submitted through the DAO and it becomes active, including additional details and with hyperlinks underneath the requesting amount such as:\n\n*   Display number of grants received in the past\n*   DIsplay number of grants proposed\n*   Display number of grants revoked\n*   Display total amount funded to the grantee\n\n**Integration Difficulty - Low**\n\nBased on the feedback on Canny, the parameters already exists by clicking on an individuals profile. Integrating the parameters should not be a heavy lift. Below is the request submitted to Canny on 26 AUG 2023.\n\n*   https://decentraland.canny.io/governance/p/incorporate-ui-parameters-highlighting-information-on-grantees-for-active-grant\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAlthough, the settings may be found by clicking on the individual’s profile- by incorporating the proposed parameters, it will permit ease of access to the voters to execute and make sound decisions regarding active grant proposals without the burden of doing extensive research or clicking back and forth between individuals’ profiles and the proposal, which in turn will save time and assist in making sound decisions.\n\nLook forward to any feedback from the community.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xd4f1cab694c4424c4796549edbb9b489789f4df5 (TudaMoon)\n\n### Problem\n\nGrant Support Squad brought in a governance proposal and has failed to do their duties according to the enacted governance proposal they have created. https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ce104d00-7d94-11ed-8456-a323c09ee17e\n\nThis governance proposal is for the creation of the Accountability Committee (to be later renamed by DAO to Revocations Committee) and it provides the new procedure that they are supposed to follow.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KP8iUDl.png)\n\nIt states \"The Grant Support Squad will request the grantee *to respond to the concerns* raised and if the *concerns continue*, they will send the arguments for the Accountability Committee to evaluate the case. This triggers a preventive revocation or a pause to the Vesting Contract.\"\n\nThe **concerns raised** are the DAO community member's concerns. The reason you can come to that conclusion is because in number 1 it talks about Community Members using a form to submit them. There is no definition of concern and since there is no definition, it doesn't exclude any type of concerns. It would cover all concerns.\n\nThat means if there is a continuous concern, even after the information requested from the grantee, **it is the duty of the GSS to send the arguments to the Revocations Squad. At that point in time, the vesting contract is paused.**\n\n### Solution\n\nPause the Vesting Contract of the Grant Support Squad's current grant until these rules implemented by the DAO are followed by the Grant Support Squad. Their grant will be un-paused by only one (1) voting stage through a governance pre-proposal poll.\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Players learn industry terminology while competing through action cards to be the first to collect three full NFT collections (game cards, not actual onchain non-fungible tokens) to win. While the title plays on the pun of #NFT non-fungible tokens, it's an #IRL activity that you'll quickly find becomes a household favorite.\n\nAs a bonus, each of the Non-Fun Gameʻs 40 original illustrations are also actual NFTs stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Polygon Ethereum (EVM) enabled sidechain and hosted on IPFS.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n21,200 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x01dace1dA0DCdA8F4B8b7deab19CFA1bfC8D1047\n\n## Email address\n\nlisa@nonfungame.xyz\n\n## Description\n\nUnfortunately our project was rejected from launching on Kickstarter due to the use of terms like \"NFT\" and \"blockchain\". So trying to seek funding elsewhere to bring the game to life. We have a prototype that has gone through a few rounds of design tweeks and even have an extension pack.\n\nYou can learn more about the game and watch a few videos on our website https://nonfungame.xyz\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nhttps://nonfungame.xyz/index.html#roadmap\n\nWe are behind because Kickstarter rejected the project launch for the physical card game. We've launched two NFT collections, and have a prototype of the main card game as well as the first expansion pack. We just need the funding to pay for production costs and bring the game to life. If approved, I'd love to highlight Decentraland as one of the \"NFT Collections\" in the game, where players can collect land NFTs to win.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x89ffc3381d33bf2be9df3a295ac1fca8d51834b5 (Thegreatnik)\n\nIn response to the challenges faced by brands' hesitancy to explore the metaverse with low costs and resources spent, followed by the financial limitations that creators experience, a groundbreaking solution has emerged.\n\nRecognizing the need to bridge this gap, the concept of the Metaverse Creators Fund was born. This independent initiative aims to empower and financially support creators within Decentraland to create reusable, white-label experiences for brands.\n\nWhile the Metaverse Creators Fund operates independently, it benefits from the invaluable expertise of MetaViu, a key player renowned for its work with brands and builders, hosting virtual event extensions in Decentraland, onboarding brands and helping landowners to monetize their lands through advertising opportunities and etc. This collaboration ensures a comprehensive approach, right from onboarding brands to guiding the incubation process.\n\nIt's important to emphasize that the Metaverse Creators Fund is not limited to MetaViu alone. Other forward-thinking agencies are also invited to join forces, amplifying the impact and reach of the initiative, onboard brands and contribute to Decentraland. By uniting various industry players, the fund aims to create a robust ecosystem where creators flourish, brands find innovative avenues of white-label experiences and the metaverse evolves into a thriving realm of possibilities.\n\nTo cultivate a thriving ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders, the fund engages an impartial panel composed of distinguished experts representing prominent companies across diverse consumer product sectors. This strategic step ensures that decision-making authority rests in the hands of unbiased parties, leveraging their expertise to fund the most exceptional experiences within Decentraland. This esteemed panel infuses the fund with an unmatched level of curation and trust, providing participants with the assurance of its credibility.\n\nThe inclusion of such a distinguished jury not only enhances the selection process but also reinforces the fund's commitment to excellence. With their involvement, there's an elevated level of due diligence applied to assess the commercial viability of projects in advance. This brings a heightened level of rigor to the evaluation process, ultimately resulting in the sponsorship of experiences that exhibit both creative brilliance and the potential for sustainable success.\n\n- I like the idea\n- No, It´s not relevant for the community\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Decentraland DAO Headquarters",
    "body": "> by 0x5b5cc427c1d81db4f94de4d51d85ce122d63e244 (Fehz)\n\nShould the problem/opportunity outlined be refined and taken to the next level?\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nDecentraland DAO stands as a leading force and a pivotal entity for innovation in the blockchain-based virtual worlds space. At this point, establishing a central hub becomes essential to streamline our operations through a full comprehensive metaverse experience.\n\nMoreover, to date, we could say that there exists a noticeable disconnect between the discussions held within the DAO and the activities unfolding in Decentraland. Bridging these two experiences is an imperative need within our community.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nWe propose the construction of the Decentraland DAO Headquarters in Genesis City, a virtual space that will serve as the epicenter of our operations, community activities and as a welcoming space for new joiners. This headquarters should be more than just a building; it will be a dynamic, immersive hub that encapsulates the spirit of decentralization, innovation, and collaboration of our community.\n\nThe DAO Headquarters should not only address the current requirements of the DAO, but also allow a space for innovation. All identified needs and potential uses of this building should be envisioned with the broader perspective of benefiting both the DAO and the entire Decentraland ecosystem to become the driving force behind the success of the open metaverse.\n\n*   **Architectural Decisions:** The architectural design of the Decentraland DAO Headquarters should balance aesthetics, functionality, and scalability. Should also embrace a modular and sustainable approach, allowing for growth and adaptation as our community evolves.\n*   **Features and Infrastructure:** Within the headquarters, we will define key features and infrastructure, including presentation areas, meeting rooms, social spaces, interactive elements, and accessibility options to cater to diverse community needs.\n*   **Educational and Onboarding purposes:**  The headquarters UI/UX should be a vehicle to provide resources, workshops, and interactive experiences tailored to empower both newcomers and seasoned participants. From comprehensive onboarding materials and tutorials for those new to Decentraland to advanced educational initiatives to foster a deeper understanding of the ecosystem.\n*   **Functionalities:** The Decentraland DAO Headquarters will facilitate a wide range of functionalities, from hosting Town Halls, events, collaborative discussions, and workshops to voting, promoting engagement, and governance matters. Integration with the MarketPlace, Governance Platform and other dApps.\n*   **DAO and Community Awareness**: The headquarters should play a pivotal role in creating awareness about the DAO, its grantees, creators, builders, and governance matters. Through interactive exhibits, informative displays, and engaging presentations, should serve as a prominent platform to spotlight and showcase the diverse projects, initiatives and achievements within the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\n1.  **Decentraland Community:** Decentraland contributors, grantees, developers, creators, and governance participants looking for a centralized hub to connect and collaborate.\n2.  **New joiners**: the offering a comprehensive onboarding experience to welcome and empower individuals entering the Decentraland community.\n3.  **Educators and Researchers:** Individuals seeking to study, learn, and conduct research within Decentraland and the open metaverse.\n4.  **Innovators, Developers and Partners:** Those interested in decentralized technologies, virtual reality, and the metaverse, who want to explore Decentraland's potential. Tech-savy individuals seeking a fertile ground for development and innovation could be drawn to the HQ as a proof of concept of the Metaverse and its uses.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nBuilding the Decentraland DAO Headquarters in-world is especially relevant now for several key reasons:\n\n1.  **Momentum:** The concept of the metaverse has gained significant traction, with major tech companies and investors pouring resources into its development. Establishing DAO presence within Decentraland positions us at the forefront of this industry.\n2.  **Branding and Visibility:** A dedicated HQ serves as a visual testament to Decentraland DAO's commitment and vision, reinforcing its brand identity in the digital landscape.\n3.  **Community Growth:** The Decentraland community is expanding rapidly, and it's crucial to provide a centralized space to nurture connections, collaborations, and innovation.\n4.  **Global Accessibility:** The existence of the headquarters ensures that all Decentraland participants worldwide can access and engage with our initiatives, regardless of geographic location or time zone.\n5.  **User Experience:**\n    Enhancing the user experience within the headquarters is fundamental, ensuring intuitive navigation, clear signage, and a seamless interface that accommodates both experienced users and those new to DAO meetings or Decentraland.\n6.  **Community Benefits:**\n    Our headquarters will be designed to benefit the community, fostering networking opportunities, collaboration, showcasing achievements, providing educational resources, and encouraging participation in DAO decision-making processes. Moreover, its adaptable design should ensure the integration and expansion to accommodate future technological advancements and emerging community needs.\n7.  **Awareness:** A seamless experience could potentially increase awareness and can lead to wider adoption of Decentraland, not only as a virtual world but also as a platform for building decentralized applications and experiences.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Should DAO proposals have a pre-defined 'Abstain' voting option?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2d146330-9e70-11ed-868f-0d503a0e5b7e)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to clarify a contradiction present in the enacted Governance proposal that I authored.\nIn that proposal, in two different sections, there are contradicting specifications of how the Abstain votes affect the outcome of a proposal.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nIn the [enacted Governance proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4ceeb900-ac83-11ed-ac8c-716656805a96) there are two definitions of how the Abstain votes behave when calculating the outcome of a proposal:\nIn the Specification section, under the subtitle Implementation, I state: \"The abstain option will be counted separately from the \"for\" and \"against\" votes, and will not affect the outcome of the vote.\" However, in the Implementation Pathway section I state: \"If the 'Abstain' option accumulates more VP than the Yes/No option, the proposal will be considered 'Rejected' by the community.\"\n\nThis mistake is simply a result of copying and pasting text from different versions of the drafts I used to elaborate the proposal.\n\n**The definition that should prevail is the one present in the Specification section: \"The abstain option will be counted separately from the \"for\" and \"against\" votes, and will not affect the outcome of the vote.\"**\n\nThis is how it currently works and it's how the Governance Squad implemented the feature in our Governance dApp and Snapshot strategy. Here's the [Github issue](https://github.com/decentraland/governance/issues/808) we used to track the development, where the task is specified.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nClarify a contradiction regarding how Abstain votes should be calculated and how they impact the outcome of a proposal in the previously published, voted, passed, and enacted [Governance proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4ceeb900-ac83-11ed-ac8c-716656805a96) regarding this topic.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis is currently implemented as defined:\n\nAdding an abstain predefined option to the DAO's voting system (Similar to how the Invalid Question/Options currently work for Polls), would allow members to indicate that they do not wish to vote either for or against a proposal. This option would be available alongside the existing options of \"Yes\" and \"No\". This option will be added only for proposals with Yes/No options (Not applicable to Pre-proposal Polls)\n\n### Implementation\n\n*   The abstain option will be added to the DAO's Snapshot space and the Governance dApp and will be available to all members in Yes/No proposals (POIs, Catalyst Node, Name Ban, Grant Request, Linked Wearables Registry, Draft Proposal, and Governance Proposal).\n*   The abstain option will be counted separately from the \"for\" and \"against\" votes, and will not affect the outcome of the vote.\n*   A summary of the abstain votes will be included in the results of the vote, along with the total number of \"for,\" \"against,\" and abstain votes.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe impact of this proposal is to clarify a previous mistake and have a strong Governance model where the mechanisms are crisply defined and validated by the community.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe feature is currently implemented as working as defined in the **Specification** section of this proposal.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### Benefits\n\n*   Allows members to express a neutral position on a proposal, rather than feeling forced to take a stance.\n*   Provides a more accurate representation of member opinions, as it allows those who are unsure or neutral to make their views known.\n*   Increases the legitimacy of the voting process and its engagement levels, as it allows all members to fully participate without feeling pressure to take a position they may not fully agree with.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x7a7280e299b79b7bd14d7501e3a03a0b77541622 (Monotributista)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Removal of Arbitrary Restrictions on Worlds in Decentraland](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2a172650-4c57-11ee-b70f-d545cab0929e)\n\n## Summary\n\nRemove restrictions on Worlds in Places dApp, initially implemented to uphold Genesis City's value. This proposal aims to make all Worlds discoverable through the Places dApp and the platform in general.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to address and reconsider the limitations currently imposed on Worlds within the Decentraland platform. These restrictions have ostensibly been put in place to maintain the value of land parcels within Genesis City. However, this practice contradicts the initial purpose of Worlds, which was to lower the barrier to entry and encourage a broader creator community. This proposal argues that the existing restrictions on Worlds do not enhance the value of Genesis City, and moreover, devalue the overall platform.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDespite the promising prospects Worlds offer, current limitations make them less useful than they could be. These restrictions include non-accessibility or being hidden from the broader Decentraland community. These limitations ostensibly exist to preserve the value and exclusivity of Genesis City land parcels, yet they conflict with the initial intent behind introducing Worlds.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Objective\n\nThe aim of this technical implementation is to amend the Places dApp within Decentraland to make all Worlds discoverable. The implementation encompasses several steps, including adjustments to specific queries and removal of unnecessary code.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n**Modify `findWorld` and `countWorlds` queries**: Upon review of the Places dApp repository, it is identified that removing the `AND hidden is false` condition from the [findWorld](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/entities/Place/model.ts#L494) and [countWorlds](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/entities/Place/model.ts#L542) queries would render all Worlds discoverable.\n\n**Remove `updateIndexWorlds` method**: This [method](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/entities/Place/model.ts#L410-L433) would now be redundant and should be removed from the codebase to eliminate unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Remove `processWorldsIndexing` task**: This [task](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/entities/World/task/processWorldsIndexing.ts) is called periodically and its purpose becomes obsolete once the [updateIndexWorlds](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/entities/Place/model.ts#L410-L433) method is removed.\n\n**Delete `hidden` column from schema**: With the removal of the aforementioned queries and methods, the [hidden column](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/entities/World/schemas.ts#L179-L182) in the database schema will no longer be required and should be eliminated.\n\n**Remove disclaimer regarding discoverability**: Any user-facing notices or alerts mentioning that some Worlds are not discoverable should be expunged from the UI, like [this one](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/pages/worlds.tsx#L192-L195) and its [translations](https://github.com/decentraland/places/blob/master/src/intl/en.json#L120).\n\n### Feedback\n\nFoundation developers and other experts within the community are encouraged to review these changes to ensure a comprehensive and error-free implementation.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe restrictions on Worlds neither enhance the value of Genesis City nor promote the core philosophy of Decentraland, which is decentralization and open participation. Removing these arbitrary limitations will likely result in a more engaged, dynamic, and valuable ecosystem for all stakeholders involved.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xd4f1cab694c4424c4796549edbb9b489789f4df5 (TudaMoon)\n\n### Problem\n\nCurrently, you only need one (1) proposal to get a grant approved, but you need three (3) to revoke a malicious grant. Currently, we have a Grant Support Squad and a Revocations Committee implemented by the DAO. These current processes are NOT permanent solutions as they must be re-enacted by the DAO in order to continue. The DAO always has the ability to make the final decisions over grants; whether it means overriding the GSS or Revocations Committee through a DAO proposal, or bypassing the GSS or Revocations Committee through a DAO proposal.\n\nThe current problem with the DAO proposal for grant revocations or overriding GSS or Revocations Committee's decisions is that it takes way too much time before a grant's vesting contract is paused. Three (3) proposals takes too long while the DAO funds have potential to be drained.\n\n### Solution\n\n1.  Create a new proposal Category for DAO called *Grant Revocation.*\n\n2.  This new Category would come with a new process of revocation.\n\n### Part 1: First round of Voting\n\nThe first round of voting will site the grant in question and place it up for revocation proceedings. If the first round of voting, the grant in question is chosen to be revoked, the vesting contract would be **paused** for the grant in question.\n\nThen this proceeding is moved to *Part 2.*\n\n### Part 2: Grant Support Squad and the Revocation Committee\n\nBoth, the Grant Support Squad and the Revocation Committee will put the grant in question up for revocation review. Both the Grant Support Squad and the Revocations Committee will then do research to determine whether the grant is revoked or not revoked as individual groups.\n\nBefore each group decides, the Grant Support Squad and the Revocations Committee will share any gathered information, evidence provided, discussions on the forum, updates and more to determine if the grant should or should not be revoked. Both groups will individually have 14 days total to decide on the outcome and must give a public update on their ruling/decision.\n\nIf an extension of time is needed by either group, they each are given a chance for a 1-time 14-day extension. The grant’s vesting contract will remain paused until the final deadline is lapsed or until they both give their final decisions. If either group’s decision is to revoke the grant in question, the grant’s vesting contract funds will be released back to the DAO funds.\n\nOnly one of the 2 groups decisions needs to be to revoke the grant for the grant in question to be revoked.\n\nFor example, If the Grant Support Squad chooses to revoke the grant, but the Revocations chooses to keep the grant going, then the final decision is still to be revoked. Visa Versa. They are NOT required to come to the same decision. It only takes one of the groups to come to that decision.\n\nIf the grant in question is chosen to be revoked, this will be the final decision and there is no need to move forward with *Part 3.* However, if both groups choose to allow the grant to continue, then the DAO members can choose to move to *Part 3.*\n\n### Part 3: Overriding Decisions\n\nIf the DAO chooses to override the Grant Report Squad’s and Revocation Committee’s decisions to allow the grant to continue, the DAO must do two (2) more rounds of voting. During this time, the grant’s vesting contract will be un-paused and will resume as it was. However, if the second round of voting chooses to revoke (first round of voting for Part 2) the grant’s vesting contract will *pause* until the final round of voting is complete.\n\nIf the second round of voting chooses to revoke, the third round of voting must begin within 28 days total from the date of the completed second round of voting. If no third round of voting is initiated by the 28 days, this proceeding is dissolved and the vesting contract for the grant in question will be un-paused and resume.\nIf the final (third) round of voting chooses to *revoke* the grant in question, the grant’s vesting contract funds will be released back to the DAO funds.\n\n### Clarifications\n\n*   Part 3 cannot override decisions to revoke. Once a grant is revoked, in Part 2, then that is the final decision.\n*   Part 3 the final round of voting (third total round) is final decision.\n*   Grant Seekers can propose a new grant to finish their revoked grant if they choose, through a new traditional grant proposal.\n*   This proceeding and new category does NOT prevent the same grant from being up for revocation at another time.\n*   There can only be one (1) revocation proceeding per grant in question at a time. However, there can be multiple revocation proceedings at a time, just not for the same grant.\n\nVoting 'For' on this pre-poll means that you are in favor of creating this new Revocation Category with new procedures.\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This aligns with the core tenet of the ENS DAO Constitution, which states that \"Name ownership shall not be infringed.\"\nBy removing 'Name Ban' as a Common Actions Category in DAO Proposals, the DAO reaffirms its commitment to respecting users' rights and maintaining a fair and open ecosystem for all participants.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nRemove 'Name Ban' as a Common Action Category in DAO Proposals under:\n\n\"Name ownership shall not be infringed.\"\n\nThe Decentraland DAO will not enact any change that infringes on the rights of Decentraland's Name users to retain names they own, or unfairly discriminate against name owners’ ability to transfer, or otherwise use their names.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal seeks to fortify the foundation of Decentraland's principles and values. It acknowledges the importance of respecting user ownership, aligns with established constitutions, and ultimately strives for a more inclusive, fair, and rights-conscious Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Dedicated, long-time Decentralites who have waited in vain for essential documentation have already begun to leave. Current documentation is inconsistent and incomplete. It takes a long time to track down relevant, current and functional information. Decentral Ed, Canessa and AwedJob, with 18 years of teaching experience combined, will help more people faster, and more effectively with up-to-date information located in one place, and updated frequently.\n\nDecentral Ed will look at existing public questions, and we will ask people about their gaps in understanding during weekly “open knowledge” sessions to find what people need to know. We will then create documentation addressing these topics.\n\nWe will deliver subject specific, cross-standard, information in text form located in one authoritative place. An online document can be more easily updated and maintained than a soon to be outdated “how to video”. Our documents may also be printed, making them readily available when you are away from your computer as well. Text is easily queried, referenced, and digested by search engines and large language model A.I.\n\nDecentral Ed will separate documents into three standards, update them regularly, and ensure their accuracy. These standards are: Governance, Social and Development. We will write documentation for people at the novice and advanced beginner levels. These are the first two of five different skill levels: novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, and expert. We feel that there is an existing body of proficient and expert level documentation. We will not be creating documentation for those top two skill levels.\n\nDecentral Ed will produce a minimum of 200 documents over the course of 2,080 work hours in a period of six months. The subject matter for these documents will come from existing unanswered questions found on Discord servers, Reddit posts, GitHub repos, and StackOverflow posts. We will fill existing gaps like “how to rotate a scene in SDK7” and “Deploying multiple video screens from one m3u8 video stream.” Decentral Ed will field suggestions and answer questions during twice-weekly “DEd Reckoning” sessions. These will be streamed live inside DEd.dcl.eth using DCL Cast, simulcast to Twitch, Kick, and YouTube and will be recorded.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nSeptember:\n12th - DEd Reckoning Inaugural: ask Canessa & AwedJob about this proposal ||\n21st - DEd Reckoning Governance: How to DAO, delegate VP, and get involved ||\n26th - DEd Reckoning Social: How to rent land to host your first party in DCL ||\n28th - DEd Reckoning Development: Guest developers discuss Smart Wearables and SDK7 ||\n6 work days for documentation creation\n\nOctober:\n22 work days, 8 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 33 documents\n\nNovember:\n20 work days, 8 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 30 documents\n\nDecember:\n22 work days, 7 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 33 documents\n\nJanuary:\n22 work days, 8 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 37 documents\n\nFebruary:\n20 work days, 8 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 37 documents\n\nMarch:\n18 work days, 6 DEd Reckoning Sessions, 30 documents\n\nApril:\nEnd of grant celebration\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Introducing HODLFi - A New Paradigm for Decentraland in Bear Markets",
    "body": "> by 0x2faab28f398c330430157893a48edc3799d99159 (LandLordDao)\n\nIntroduction:\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of Decentraland (DCL), adaptation and innovation are essential to its long-term success. Bear markets, characterized by reduced trading activity and declining asset values, challenge us to think creatively and develop strategies that not only weather the storm but thrive in it. One such strategy we propose is the introduction of HODLFi, a novel concept that merges the enduring \"HODL\" mantra with the financial potential of decentralized virtual assets.\n\nHODLFi:\nHODLFi is more than just a catchy name; it's a financial ecosystem designed to empower DCL asset holders during bear markets and beyond. At its core, HODLFi offers APR interest to those who commit to holding DCL assets, which include LAND, MANA, wearables, names, and more. Here's how it works:\n\n1.Asset Incentives: Users who retain their DCL assets are rewarded with annual percentage rate (APR) interest. The longer you hold, the more you earn.\n\n2.Asset Inclusivity: HODLFi is open to all DCL assets, making it accessible to LAND owners, MANA holders, wearable collectors, and those with Decentraland Names.\n\n3.Boost Community Engagement: This feature aligns with the ethos of decentralization and community participation, making DCL a more attractive ecosystem.\n\n4.Collaboration with Wallets and Exchanges: HODLFi will be designed to work seamlessly with popular wallets and market exchanges to ensure accessibility and user-friendliness.\n\nImplementation:\nThe implementation of HODLFi will involve the following steps:\n\n1.Smart Contract Development: Develop a smart contract that calculates and distributes APR interest based on the assets held in users' wallets.\n\n2.Integration with Wallets: Collaborate with popular DCL wallets to integrate HODLFi features, making it easy for users to participate.\n\n3.User Education: Provide clear and comprehensive educational resources to help DCL community members understand and benefit from HODLFi.\n\nWhy HODLFi Matters:\nIn bear markets, the inclination is often to divest from assets to minimize losses. HODLFi encourages the opposite – to hold and grow your assets. By doing so, we achieve several critical objectives:\n\n1.Community Engagement: HODLFi fosters community solidarity and encourages users to remain actively involved in Decentraland during market downturns.\n\n2.Asset Value Stabilization: The consistent holding of assets by a substantial portion of the community can help stabilize the values of DCL assets.\n\n3.Long-Term Growth: As assets appreciate, the HODLFi ecosystem contributes to the long-term growth of Decentraland, strengthening its overall position in the metaverse landscape.\n\n4.Assets in Decentraland:\nTo understand the full scope of HODLFi, it's essential to recognize the diverse assets that define Decentraland:\n\n5.LAND: Virtual real estate parcels within Decentraland, representing unique digital assets ripe for development.\n\n6.MANA: The native cryptocurrency of Decentraland, facilitating transactions, governance, and participation in the metaverse.\n\n7.Wearable Items: Digital clothing, accessories, and skins that personalize user avatars, often created by artists and developers.\n\n8.Names (Decentraland Names): Unique domain names associated with specific locations within Decentraland, simplifying navigation.\n\n9.Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): All assets within Decentraland, including LAND, wearables, and names, are represented as NFTs, ensuring ownership and uniqueness.\n\n10.Estates: Collections of contiguous LAND parcels that enable larger and more intricate developments.\n\n11.Scenes and Experiences: User-created digital environments and interactive experiences with 3D models, animations, and more.\n\n12.Art and Collectibles: A wide array of digital art and collectible NFTs, showcasing the diversity of the DCL ecosystem.\n\n13.Virtual Goods and Services: Diverse offerings within Decentraland, including games, events, virtual real estate development, and more.\n\nConclusion:\nHODLFi, alongside our commitment to promoting asset retention, reinforces the resiliency and growth of Decentraland during bear markets. By embracing this innovative financial ecosystem and recognizing the value of our diverse assets, we can fortify our position as a leading metaverse and weather market fluctuations with confidence. Together, we will navigate bear markets, uphold the HODL spirit, and emerge stronger, all while enhancing the Decentraland experience for our community.\n\nDecentraland: Building a Resilient Metaverse, One HODL at a Time.\n\n- yes\n- no\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Promote/Market Decentraland Names as Human Readable Crypto Wallet Addresses",
    "body": "> by 0xbc02db030361121dd43bbb2fcbcb4f9f98c1dc7d (Edgelord)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[should we promote decentraland names as an alternative cryptocurrency human readable wallet addresses?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ac360f90-36a2-11ee-be2d-676a2489bc16)\n\n## Summary\n\nI believe Decentraland Foundation should set a budget of up to between $10K - $100K and allocate a small team (maybe only one person) to start promoting Decentraland names as an alternative Human Readable Cryptocurrency wallet addresses.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nMajor upside to Decentraland names is that, there are no yearly renewal fees as all names are subdomains of DCL. Besides this there are many other added benefits like the Worlds, in-world avatar name, use as link etc.. to name a few. With the right marketing this will help boost Decentraland as the ultimate Decentralised Web3, Metaverse platform, by bringing in new users through this simple yet effective human readable wallet aspect.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nGiven that a Decentraland Name costs ~$30 to register and own for lifetime with all it's added perks, features & benefits, I say we have an opportunity to become a serious competitor in this space and own a large portion of the market share if a team was put together to focus on this. Along with in-depth research and correct market analysis I believe there is nothing out there that can stop us.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nCurrently there are two major competitors who are competing in this field. One being ENS & the other Unstoppable. Unstoppable Domains are extremely centralised and depending on the name extension they can be very expensive with yearly renewal fees.\n\nUnstoppable Domains currently have 11 naming extension and this is most likely to grow. Registration fees range between $5-$1200 depending on the extension selected. Similar to ENS Domains, Unstoppable Domain also have yearly renewal fees\n\nENS Domains are decentralised and they do represent a large portion of the Web3 community when it comes to human readable wallet addresses. One downside is ENS also has yearly renewal fees and for a 3 digit/letter it is $640 per year, for a 4 letter/digit it's $160 per year and for 5 letter/digit, $5 per year\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAllocate a budget of between $10K - $100K from the foundation. If starting with $10K budget, base it upon conversion rate, metrics & performance. At the end of each quarter there should be a review to see whether if the foundation should keep funding this initiative or not. I don't know if this is something our marketing team can tackle or if a new team (or a specific individual) would need to be hired. Blogs, articles, documentation, videos and whatever else is required to let everyone know that now there is an alternative option for everyone\n\nAlthough the builder app is working fine for claiming decentraland names, maybe a feature could be added for setting resolver & primary wallet addresses. This will prevent users from going over to ENS App & benefit Decentraland if all the options including setting resolver adding addresses etc.. were to be done all within DCL Builder.  This could be an ongoing thing if it's successful and well received by the wider crypto communities. Aim of this is to provide solutions to rising costs & ongoing fees involved with owning a Crypto Wallet Address.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Integrate UI/UX Parameters to Provide Grantee Details for an Active Grant Proposal",
    "body": "> by 0x2684a202a374d87bb321a744482b89bf6deaf8bd (FriskyBumbleBee)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to assist in making better informed decisions regarding voting for an active grant through the DAO. By adding certain parameters to the grant details, it can assist voters to view any previous lines of efforts the grantee may have been involved in.\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nBy adding UI/UX parameters to show the numbers of grants received, number of grants proposed, number of grants revoked, and total amount funded (with links to the proposals) this may aid in making better informed and sound decisions in the DAO. Voters will have the opportunity to see previous lines of efforts the grantee may have been involved in and make the determination along with their pitch to whether they should either vote Yes or No for the proposal.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThe DAO Grants program is a unique line of effort which provides financial capital to grow their respective business or line of efforts which will also result in the growth of the platform. By enabling creators and builders through this line of effort, it works in parallel by providing the financial capital to the grantee and building the platform. However, it proves difficult to track whether the grantee may or may have not been involved in other lines of efforts. This gap of information can also be addressed by word of mouth, or by researching on previous grants that have been passed which may be a burden for voters who may have a time constraint. Many times, an individual may not be aware the grantee had received funding or made numerous proposals in the past unless another senior community member may have brought it to their attention. By incorporating the proposed parameters, it will bolster voters to execute sound decisions based on the information highlighted through the parameters.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n\n*Option 1:*\n\n*   Once a grant is active, underneath the requesting amount- include # of grants received, # of grants proposed, # of grants revoked, and total amount funded for the grantee.\n\n*Option 2:*\n\n*   Once a grant is active, underneath the proposal details near the author’s name include # of grants received, # of grants proposed, # of grants revoked, and total amount funded for the grantee.\n\n**Integration Difficulty - Low**\n\nBased on the feedback on Canny, the parameters already exists by clicking on an individuals profile. Integrating the parameters should not be a heavy lift. Below is the request submitted to Canny on 26 AUG 2023.\n\n*   https://decentraland.canny.io/governance/p/incorporate-ui-parameters-highlighting-information-on-grantees-for-active-grant\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAlthough, the settings may be found by clicking on the individual’s profile- by incorporating the proposed parameters, it will permit ease of access to the voters to execute and make sound decisions regarding active grant proposals without the burden of doing extensive research or clicking back and forth between individuals’ profiles and the proposal, which in turn will save time and assist in making sound decisions.\n\nLooking forward to feedback from the community.\n\n- Yes, option 1\n- Yes, option 2\n- No\n- Abstain\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Expanding DCL Platforms: Mobile Godot Client and Desktop Bevy Client Development",
    "body": "> by 0x83f9192d59b393c8789b55d446e5d4a77075c820 (Lean)\n\nShould the following $153,200 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAfter the goals achieved in the Protocol Squad we want to present this proposal which aims to advance the Decentraland metaverse by developing mobile clients with the Godot engine, targeting Android and iOS platforms, with the potential to publish on App Store and Play Store and by continuing the development of the Bevy engine's desktop client, thereby indirectly contributing to the Godot project, while also preparing for desktop client deployment.\n\nOn the other hand, we want to keep making contributions to Decentraland's documentation, and collaboration work with the Foundation. Crucially, we want to develop test scenes in-house to ensure the compatibility, completeness, and uniformity of SDK7 implementation across all client platforms.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n153,200 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x04812c531083054863ef354EF600A61857921466\n\n## Email address\n\nleangodotdev@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nIn our continuous efforts to propel Decentraland into the forefront of the decentralized metaverse, we propose a comprehensive plan with primary and secondary objectives to enhance the user experience, expand the reach of Decentraland's client base, and contribute to the ecosystem's growth.\n\n### Primary Objectives:\n\n*   **Godot Mobile Clients (Android and iOS)**: Our foremost goal is to develop mobile clients for the Decentraland metaverse using the Godot engine. These clients will be tailored for Android and iOS platforms, with the potential for publication on the App Store and Play Store. This expansion aims to make Decentraland more accessible to a wider audience, providing a seamless and immersive experience on mobile devices.\n*   **Bevy Desktop Client Development**: In the short term, we will continue the development of the Decentraland Bevy engine's desktop client. By doing so, we indirectly contribute to the Godot project, as both engines share the Rust language, common goals, and development principles. This effort ensures that Decentraland has a robust desktop client, positioning it for future deployment on various desktop platforms.\n\n### Secondary Objectives:\n\n*   **User Experience Enhancement**: Central to our approach is prioritizing the user experience. We aim to create a user-friendly environment in which casual users can interact seamlessly with Web3, all without the need to manage a self-custodial wallet. Additionally, we will focus on enhancing user engagement within the virtual world, refining elements such as player locomotion, emotes, and other interactive features.\n*   **Test scenes**: Test scenes will be developed by our team to ensure the compatibility, completeness, and uniformity of SDK7 implementation across all the clients.\n*   **Documentation and Collaboration**: We are committed to maintaining and enhancing Decentraland's documentation. This includes contributions to documentation repositories and working closely with the Decentraland Foundation to address any unfinished tasks. Our goal is to ensure that users and developers have access to comprehensive and up-to-date resources for utilizing Decentraland's features and protocols.\n*   **SDK7 Enrichment** : We will actively participate in the growth and improvement of SDK7. Our contributions will involve refining the SDK, adding new features, and ensuring its compatibility with our client developments, thereby fostering a thriving Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, our proposal outlines a multifaceted approach to elevate Decentraland's metaverse experience. By expanding to mobile platforms with Godot, continuing Bevy's desktop client development, and focusing on user-centric enhancements, we aim to make Decentraland more accessible, engaging, and immersive for users and developers alike. Our commitment to documentation, collaboration, and SDK7 growth further solidifies Decentraland's position as a leading decentralized virtual world.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### Milestone 1 - Dec 31st 2023\n\n*   Web3\n    *   Allow players to maintain an identity without an external wallet\n    *   Allow users to link an external wallet in the new explorers to establish permanent identity\n    *   Provide a mechanism for signing transactions\n\n*   SDK completeness\n    *   minimal functional support for all non-deprecated SDK7 components and RPC calls\n\n*   Compliance test scenes\n    *   Transform\n    *   MeshRenderer\n    *   Material\n    *   Visibility\n    *   Billboard\n    *   Raycast\n    *   GltfContainer\n    *   Animator\n    *   TextShape\n    *   EngineInfo\n    *   CameraMode\n    *   PointerEvents\n    *   PointerLock\n\n### Milestone 2 - Mar 31st 2024\n\n*   Player Locomotion proposal\n    *   Specification for player locomotion\n    *   Implementation in the new explorers\n\n*   Beta release\n    *   Mobile explorer signed and available for iOS and Android\n    *   Desktop explorer signed available from decentraland.org\n\n*   Compliance test scenes\n    *   AvatarAttach\n    *   AudioSource\n    *   AudioStream\n    *   VideoPlayer\n    *   UiTransform\n    *   UiCanvasInformation\n    *   UiBackground\n    *   UiLabel\n    *   UiText\n    *   UiInput\n    *   UiInputResult\n    *   UiDropdown\n    *   UiDropdownResult\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Revoke the Grant: Hire LordLike as DAO Strategic Unit (DAO worker)",
    "body": "> by 0x0214b80ad993edb57dac15e156681d4ad16b175b (SkinnyOrca)\n\nThe Strategic Unit was originally created via this proposal: *Hire LordLike as DAO Strategic Unit (DAO worker)*\n\nI am creating this poll to gauge the community’s sentiment on how the Strategic Unit is working so far, and if it should continue as planned, receiving $32,000 in DAO funding for its work.\n\nThis issues I take with the Strategic Unit continuing on are as follows:\n\n1.  The initiatives laid out in the Strategic Unit grant proposal are things that either are currently being done (see https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c942aa60-443c-11ee-ab1f-97157a05bdec) or could be done (see https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8f846090-c811-11ed-a454-057e86adfb11) by Core Units that are already being funded. It would seem more appropriate to revise the responsibilities of the Core Units that already exist to cover these tasks, as they generally seem to fall under what could be the jurisdiction of the existing units, than to fund one person to do these tasks.\n\n2.  LordLike has taken action that seems contradictory to values that should be held by a person in a DAO position. This includes resubmitting a proposal that did not pass without significant change or transparency (see https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=6f77cf10-3861-11ee-aec9-fb54fc0c7896 and https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=205e00a0-4173-11ee-aa49-bbddd046ff94 ) When asked about this in the DAO discord, LordLike continued to lack transparency, and to point fingers at other proposals that were resubmitted with reasonable cause (like overwhelming community support but failure to reach the VP threshold). In my opinion, these situations are not the same and should not be used as evidence to justify the action being taken here.\n\n3.  While this point is more speculative than the others, it appears that LordLike is no longer acting in the best interest of the DAO as a whole, and there is sentiment among community members as to a change in his motives since originally being approved for the Strategic Unit grant. One example of this is the initiative to revise the Land-to-MANA ratio (see https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=75cf8f80-4430-11ee-ab1f-97157a05bdec ), which if passed would place an incomparable amount of voting power (VP) in the hands of a small group of people which have historically acted in their own best interest, not necessarily the best interest of the DAO.\n    Additionally, when asked about certain stances or actions LordLike has taken, he responds in ways that are misleading and lack transparency that should be required of any person in a DAO position. For example, repeatedly citing the amount of money other Core Units have received and citing his income as $0, when in reality the grant is still in the 1-month cliff period and he is slated to receive $32,000.\n\n**Lordlike voted in favor of a vulnerability that could have forever drained the DAO with his Revise the Land-to-Mana Ratio proposal.**\n\n4.  Though this grant is in its first month of operation, it appears that the main items LordLike has contributed to the DAO have occurred prior to the Strategic Unit passing and efforts have seemingly fallen off since. When asked about his contributions, LordLike routinely cites three proposals (https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8f846090-c811-11ed-a454-057e86adfb11 ,  https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=94402470-fb15-11ed-8e4f-8db7948b5171 and https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fb54ea30-b928-11ed-95dc-afd12ca00986 ) all of which took place before the Strategic Unit was established. This shows that he was willing and able to make contributions to the DAO without receiving a significant payment. Additionally, of the three proposals cited only one has been brought beyond the poll stage, and was done so by a team of people that does not include LordLike (https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=776dbcb0-32f9-11ee-a39d-ef9ca9e669fd). There is currently little evidence available to support that the Strategic Unit is following through with the promises made in the proposal.\n\n5.  Lordlike has been actively voting in favor of grants with poor reputation and community sentiment in the DAO. It is almost as if these people seem to have a Quid Pro Quo voting scheme going on with each other. This is using his power for strategy that would help his whale voter friends and himself and is completely disregarding the community.\n\nI personally do not feel this Strategic Unit is an appropriate use of DAO funds, and the intentions and would greatly appreciate your thoughts on the matter.\n\n- Revoke\n- Do Not Revoke\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

By documenting its evolution, milestones, and key events, we gain insights into the growth and transformation of this unique decentralized ecosystem. The historical record of Decentraland not only serves as a valuable resource for researchers, enthusiasts, and stakeholders but also plays a crucial role in fostering transparency, accountability, and trust within the growing community and interest.\n\nIt is my aim to secure as much historical content as possible on one of the biggest online resources for online communities. Fandom, similar to Wikipedia, is an established platform on that regard and is widely used.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n24,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xffbf85d4a3b3cf35bcd7ad61dd4c48b9e29cc4c5\n\n## Email address\n\nelijah221@protonmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nBy documenting the platform's evolution, milestones, and key events, it addresses several crucial challenges:\n\n**Preservation of Decentraland's Legacy:**\nThis initiative safeguards the historical record of Decentraland, ensuring that its history is not lost to the passage of time.\n\n**Transparency and Trust:**\nThe project enhances transparency and accountability within Decentraland. By providing a reliable source of historical information, it minimizes the risk of misinformation, ensuring that users can trust the platform and its development processes.\n\n**Educational Resource:**\nThe documentation becomes a valuable educational resource. Researchers, enthusiasts, stakeholders, and newcomers can access a well-preserved history, gaining insights into Decentraland's unique journey.\n\n**Support for Decentralized Governance:**\nIn a digital realm where decentralized governance and ownership are paramount, information preservation serves as a fundamental pillar. It empowers the community to make informed decisions based on historical context, contributing to the platform's continued success.\n\n**Promotion of Innovation:**\nBy acknowledging the intrinsic value of historical documentation, this project promotes innovation within Decentraland. It encourages a deeper understanding of the platform's past, which can inspire future developments and creative endeavors.\n\nThis project ensures that Decentraland's history remains intact and accessible to all, enriching the platform's culture and providing a solid foundation for its future. It strengthens Decentraland's position as a pioneer in the decentralized virtual world space and reinforces the platform's appeal to a diverse audience.\n\nIt has the potential to emerge as the definitive source for all things Decentraland. In my ideal scenario, there would exist a dedicated Decentraland Wiki, distinct from the official documentation, that comprehensively covers everything related to Decentraland not included in the official sources. This independent Wiki would serve as one of the primary information repositories, accessible to all.\n\nReflecting on my journey from back in May, when I embarked on this endeavor and started a few initial pages, it became evident that this project demands a significant investment of time and effort. In the event that this proposal doesn't come to fruition, I see it as an opportunity to raise awareness. I'm determined to write articles regardless of the outcome, although I may not be able to dedicate as much time as I initially envisioned.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nInstead of stating dates for a Roadmap, I ld like to use this space for bullet points I want to address and cover.

Conflict of Interest\n\n*   **Issue**: The grant recipient voted in favor of his own proposal, which he directly benefits from. This can be due to his snapshot voting system where members of his DAO vote on whether they should vote on it or Not. However, most of the members who voted in Metatrekker’s DAO was also getting paid from the Decentraland DAO.\n*   **Issue**: Many voters who are direct beneficiaries of this grant voted on the proposal that rewarded the grant.\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f?a=0x50a83425d537e39a0b7f884dcc07e6f4f37a09f3\n\n### 2. Mismatched Budgetary Allocations\n\n*   **Travel Expenses**: The budget includes travel expenses, yet there's no evidence of any traveling being done. When confronted about the travel arrangements, the community was told “We are not travelling at all.”\n\n![Execution Team](https://i.imgur.com/YYhpb4X.png \" Execution Team \")\n![DJs](https://i.imgur.com/U3WH8xo.png \" DJs Artists \")\n![No Travel](https://i.imgur.com/xaJm95m.png \" No Traveling \")\n\n*   **SEO vs. Google Advertising**: A substantial SEO budget ($550/month for 10 months) is in place. However, it's perplexing that this significant SEO budget is proposed alongside another significant budget for Google Advertising ($450/month for 10 months). Especially when considering they're also paying for backlinks and advertising in other categories.\n\n*   **Content Creation Discrepancies**: The Social Media Manager, responsible for Content Creation, is allocated $475/month, yet a separate content creator category demands an additional $450/month.\n\n*   **Email Marketing for Get Response**: According to Notion the budget has an allocation for Email Marketing at $250/month to “Send weekly emails to email list using *getresponse* platform” and “Man power to create content and send emails.” Getresponse.com charges only $93/month for sending up to for 10,000 contacts which includes an AI email generator. Is there a reason the DAO has to pay an extra $150 a month for emails that can be AI generated? Why can't the content creator or the social media manager send out a weekly email using this service? What are the metrics of these emails and how many contacts do they actually have?\n    ![getresponse platform](https://i.imgur.com/30KHrSL.png \" getresponse platform \")\n\n### 3. Deceptive Practices\n\n*   **Misrepresentation**: The grantee claimed to be an OpenSea and Ripple investor on his metatrekkers.io website and linkedin. However in the community Discord, he said he wasn’t.\n\n*   **Hidden Transactions**: Evidence suggests that the grantee might be compensating some of his Delegators, specifically VP legendneverdie, gsbroz, landlord, etc.\n    ![MT Delegators](https://i.imgur.com/z74DJCs.png \" MT Delegators \")\n\n### 4. Lack of Transparency & Engagement\n\n*   **Avoidance in DAO Discord**: The grantee actively avoids answering questions in the DCL DAO Discord channel dedicated to him. Notable members left unanswered include Mimsy and Tudamoon.\n\n*   **Selective Communication**: He consistently ignores queries from certain community members.\n\n### 5. Financial Discrepancies\n\n*   **Server Costs**: The stated server costs are $2500 for 10 months. However, only $250 for 10 months is paid to HPrivakos. This disparity raises concerns about the potential misuse of funds and whether other servers are being utilized. Where is the rest of the $2250 going? What other server costs are needed besides video streaming for their events when they are paying to use other venues?\n\n*   **Payment for Venues**: Despite having a $24,000 total allocation for the Venue and Event Support Team, the grantee has only compensated venues from Beattrekkers Series 2 with $93.75 each. Metatrekkers stated there is 72 venues total, but if we are only compensating $93.75 each x 72 venues that equals $6750 which means that $17,250 would be for the event support team. If he were to only pay the venues and split it evenly, it would be $333.33 each for the 72 venues.\n\n*   **Not all marketing costs accounted for**: On their notion they fail to mention anything about the $4000 for their marketing plan on Forbes and Bloomberg.\n\nhttps://dcl-dao.notion.site/Marketing-Plan-ee63a795396a4bfd831d475da5b774bf\n\n### 6. Redundant Teams\n\n*   **Issue**: The grantee has set up an Execution Team for managing the event and a separate Venue and Event Support Team which also claims to handle event execution. This overlap appears to be a case of double-dipping.\n    ![Execution Team](https://i.imgur.com/YYhpb4X.png \" Execution Team \")\n    ![Event Team](https://i.imgur.com/UmQNuRT.png \" Event Team \")\n\n### 7. Metrics\n\n*   Compare their Metrics to the *Dollhouse*:\n\nhttps://dcl-metrics.com/scenes/dollhouse/c8383fca-bbb9-449e-af06-adeaef5090d5\n\n*   Compare their Metrics of their events to *TRU Band Room*:\n\nhttps://www.dcl-metrics.com/scenes/tru-x-energy/c734fa84-8acc-4c8e-b9ca-185e81a1138e\n\n*   Here is Metatrekkers’ Metrics:\n\nhttps://www.dcl-metrics.com/scenes/metatrekkers/93cc491d-cabf-46a1-b2ba-c2f9eb420a8a\nRemember people had to go to their parcel to vote on the DJ who won each battle. So this data is important to show true conversion. On August 2nd for example, Metatrekkers claim that 523 people showed up to the event. Only 24 voted at their parcel. This means their conversion rate was **4.5%** for this event. How many of those votes are part of the Metatrekkers team or friends with them already. How many of those votes are actually unique wallets?\n\n![MT Impact Metrics](https://i.imgur.com/5BYbwBW.png \" MT Impact Metrics \")\n![MT Aug 2 Metrics](https://i.imgur.com/eJpa9JF.png \" MT Aug 2 Metrics \")\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor the sake of accountability, trustworthiness, and the overall reputation of our DAO, it's important to make sure we only give grants to people with good faith, good ideas with roadmap and to a team that is able to complete what they promise. Given the array of concerns and discrepancies highlighted above, we confidently propose the revocation of the grant awarded to Metatrekkers titled “A Multi-Platform Entertainment Series Designed to Boost DCL Brand Awareness.”\n\n*We urge DAO members to deeply consider these findings and vote in favor of the revocation to uphold the integrity of Decentraland.*\n\n- Revoke\n- Do Not Revoke\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xac097c7e31a2add6244a0f36dba5776d04f5a3fc (LTC)\n\nAbstract\n\nThis proposal aims to address and reconsider the price of \"Name\" within the Decentraland platform. A name need 100 mana to claim, which contradicts the initial purpose of Worlds, which was to lower the barrier to entry and encourage a broader creator community. This proposal argues that the expensive Names do not enhance the value of Worlds, and moreover, devalue the overall platform.\n\nIntroduction\n\nDecentraland offers a unique blend of virtual real estate and content creation, providing opportunities for users to own land, create, and share content. To encourage more inclusivity and wider participation, Decentraland introduced the concept of \"Worlds.\" Worlds were meant to allow creators to develop and share content without owning land in Genesis City. This innovative feature has the potential to invite more creators into the ecosystem, fostering community engagement and platform growth.\n\nProblem Statement\n\nDespite the promising prospects Worlds offer, current price make them less useful than they could be. The 100 mana ostensibly exist to preserve the value  of Worlds, yet they conflict with the initial intent behind introducing Worlds.\n\nHypothesis\n\nThe hypothesis underlying this proposal is straightforward:  it hinders the value and potential growth of the Decentraland platform as a whole.\n\nProposed Solution\n\nReduce the price of claiming a Name to 10 mana, to make world discoverable for all users over the world.\n\nIncreased User Engagement: More creators would be able to share their creations, enhancing the overall ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe high price on Names neither enhance the value of Worlds nor promote the core philosophy of Decentraland, which is decentralization and open participation. reducing the price will likely result in a more engaged, dynamic, and valuable ecosystem for all stakeholders involved.\n\n- Yes.

    "body": "> by 0x7a7280e299b79b7bd14d7501e3a03a0b77541622 (Monotributista)\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThis proposal aims to address and reconsider the limitations currently imposed on \"Worlds\" within the Decentraland platform. These restrictions have ostensibly been put in place to maintain the value of land parcels within Genesis City. However, this practice contradicts the initial purpose of Worlds, which was to lower the barrier to entry and encourage a broader creator community. This proposal argues that the existing restrictions on Worlds do not enhance the value of Genesis City, and moreover, devalue the overall platform.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nDecentraland offers a unique blend of virtual real estate and content creation, providing opportunities for users to own land, create, and share content. To encourage more inclusivity and wider participation, Decentraland introduced the concept of \"Worlds.\" Worlds were meant to allow creators to develop and share content without owning land in Genesis City. This innovative feature has the potential to invite more creators into the ecosystem, fostering community engagement and platform growth.\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nDespite the promising prospects Worlds offer, current limitations make them less useful than they could be. These restrictions include non-accessibility or being hidden from the broader Decentraland community. These limitations ostensibly exist to preserve the value and exclusivity of Genesis City land parcels, yet they conflict with the initial intent behind introducing Worlds.\n\n**Hypothesis**\n\nThe hypothesis underlying this proposal is straightforward: making Worlds less useful will not make Genesis City more valuable. Instead, it hinders the value and potential growth of the Decentraland platform as a whole.\n\n**Proposed Solution**\n\nImmediate Removal of Restrictions: Lift the imposed restrictions on Worlds in the Places dApp, to make them discoverable for all users.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nIncreased User Engagement: More creators would be able to share their creations, enhancing the overall ecosystem.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe restrictions on Worlds neither enhance the value of Genesis City nor promote the core philosophy of Decentraland, which is decentralization and open participation. Removing these arbitrary limitations will likely result in a more engaged, dynamic, and valuable ecosystem for all stakeholders involved.\n\n- Yes, Allow All Worlds to Be Discoverable\n- No, Keep Only Worlds Belonging to LAND Owners/Renters as Discoverable\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x1b35f4d22b2c8bc706bcfcc383a1ca77fb4fc600 (punkpink)\n\nShould the problem/opportunity outlined be refined and taken to the next level?\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nA substantial amount of user-oriented material has been published, which can be quite difficult to locate. Within the initiatives funded by DAO, there are repositories and tools of important value. However, these resources often remain elusive, leaving them largely undiscovered by new users.\n\nAlthough making a pull request is open to everyone, not everyone has the time or interest to collect the data necessary to make a complete directory of the resources currently available to Decentraland users.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nI propose the creation of a dedicated section within the official Decentraland documentation that shows the vast majority of resources free to use for Decentraland users. This section would include a title, brief description, contact information of the creator and URL of the tool, repository or resources created/published by them.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nThe beneficiaries of this initiative will be all those new users who may arrive and wish to create on Decentraland. This alternative does not seem too expensive to develop and would be a way to facilitate access to the multiple resources of the platform for newcomers.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nWe need to break down barriers to facilitate access to new users and creators. The DAO has funded many high-value projects that do not have a presence on the official Decentraland websites. The cost of this action is reduced if we take into account that it would make visible many funded projects that are not used by users because the community does not have a specific section in its documentation to be able to find them easily.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Currently, we have a Grant Support Squad and a Revocations Committee implemented by the DAO. These current processes are NOT permanent solutions as they must be re-enacted by the DAO in order to continue. The DAO always has the ability to make the final decisions over grants; whether it means overriding the GSS or Revocations Committee through a DAO proposal, or bypassing the GSS or Revocations Committee through a DAO proposal.\n\nThe current problem with the DAO proposal for grant revocations or overriding GSS or Revocations Committee's decisions is that it takes way too much time before a grant's vesting contract is paused. Three (3) proposals takes too long while the DAO funds have potential to be drained.\n\n### Solution\n\n1.  Create a new proposal Category for DAO called *Grant Revocation.*\n2.  This new Category would come with a new process of revocation.\n\n*   First revocation stage if passed (in favor of revoking) by DAO would **pause** the vesting contract for the grant in question.\n*   Second revocation stage will bypass the Grant Support Squad's recommendation and automatically bring the grant in question up for review by the Revocations Committee. The Revocations Committee will then determine whether the grant is revoked or not revoked. The Revocations Committee will take information from the Grant Support Squad and evidence provided on the forum, updates and more to determine if the grant should or should not be revoked. They have 14 days total to make that determination and give a public update on their ruling/determination.\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Our Unity editor tool bridges design and deployment, making content creation effortless. Empower artists to overcome limitations and shape the future of virtual worlds. Support our transformative goal with this grant backing.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n170,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n4 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4e54dA189F2eC8e3704051df5D694dd9500D88AB\n\n## Email address\n\ninfo@polygonalmind.com\n\n## Description\n\n**Empowering Creativity in Decentraland: Changing How We Create Content**\n\nDecentraland aims to support 3D artists and unlock the platform's potential through SDK distribution. However, a significant challenge lies in the differences between tools and creation languages. While GLTF is gaining traction, it's not as widely supported as established formats like FBX.\n\nGLTF's incompatibility with popular engines like Unity, along with its technical complexity, presents a steep learning curve. This makes it hard for new users to begin, as they must learn a new format and workflow. While tools like Blender are useful for initial visual work, they have limitations when it comes to scene organization.\n\n**Creating a Smooth Path Ahead**\n\nOur project tackles this challenge directly, putting artists in the spotlight. Our goal is to remove obstacles and empower creators with a tool that follows industry standards used in gaming and film. This tool makes scene creation exceptionally easy from the start\n\n**Solving Development Challenges with Ease**\n\nWe utilize Unity, a powerful 3D engine. Our tool simplifies design and seamlessly integrates with Decentraland SDK7, making it effortless to create Decentraland projects with 3D objects, materials, textures, and animations.\n\n![](https://silver-like-hummingbird-931.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmeqTaids6S7CFeTawJrYU863UZdg9uvRz6GZkZpvB9U5u/PolygonalMind_Proposal\\_01.png)\n![](https://silver-like-hummingbird-931.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmeqTaids6S7CFeTawJrYU863UZdg9uvRz6GZkZpvB9U5u/PolygonalMind_Proposal\\_02.png)\n\n**Enhancing Developmental Value**\n\nTo simplify the process, our scene translator creates reusable code fragments. These code pieces enable interactions like links, animations, and the addition of sounds, videos, and NFTs. As development continues, the code adapts to include new SDK features, providing a dynamic platform for innovation.\n\n**An Oasis of Expertise**\n\nWith over three years of experience in Decentraland, [Polygonal Mind](https://studios.decentraland.org/profile/polygonal-mind) has gained deep technical knowledge. Our portfolio includes projects like  **Doritos**, **Megacube**, **MtnDew**, Boson Protocol, **MOMUS Park**, and **Automatic Slims**, among others. These projects show our ability to create immersive Metaverse experiences by blending art and code. We built them using a tool we developed for SDK6, showing our confidence in our work.\n\n![](https://silver-like-hummingbird-931.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmeqTaids6S7CFeTawJrYU863UZdg9uvRz6GZkZpvB9U5u/PolygonalMind_Proposal\\_05.png)\n![](https://silver-like-hummingbird-931.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmeqTaids6S7CFeTawJrYU863UZdg9uvRz6GZkZpvB9U5u/PolygonalMind_Proposal\\_06.jpg)\n\n**Embracing Collaboration**\n\nAs supporters of open-source principles, we aim to provide clear documentation and easy access to our project. Our goal is to encourage participation, making sure this tool remains a shared resource that can grow through both our efforts and community contributions. We aim to ensure the tool stays valuable as the platform evolves with new features.\n\n**A Vision for the Future**\n\nThis grant is a big step in our journey to build a better editor. We hope the community likes our work as much as our team does. In simple terms, we want to make it easier to be creative in Decentraland. We're working to remove obstacles, boost creativity, and change how virtual worlds are made. With your support, we're opening the door to a future where imagination has no limits.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n*   **Milestone 1 (Reach after 4 weeks of development)**\n    Unity is able to assemble a SDK7 project and run basic commands like `dcl install` `dcl start` or install the npm packages and any other key dependencies for Decentraland development.\n*   ********************Milestone 2 (After 4 weeks from previous milestone)********************\n    Unity is capable of exporting the gameObjects from the scene into the Decentraland project data. This includes the capability of exporting 3D data to GLTF packages as GLB+textures or GTLF+.bin\n*   **************************Milestone 3 (After 4 weeks from previous milestone)**************************\n    Unity is now completely operative when it comes on creating a scene, feeding base metadata and being able to quickly export game.ts data and iterate over the result.\n*   **********************************************************************************Milestone 4 (After 4 weeks from previous milestone)**********************************************************************************\n    This phase is about QA, ensuring UX is smooth and creating and onboarding process for the tool to act as an independent Toolkit that can be shared through Unity packages.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x8b257b97c0e07e527b073b6513ba8ea659279b61 (Morph)\n\n### Proposal:\n\nConvert up to 50% (170 Ethereum) of the current eth held by the DAO (340) to Eocketpool rEth in order to secure a ~3-4% native yield.\n\n#### Reasoning:\n\nAs we have covered in previous proposals, liquid pooled staking of Ethereum can be a decentralized, permissionless, and passive method of earning more Ethereum into the treasury of the DAO. A core critique of which, was that the execution and conversion of Mana would be a risky and speculative decision. Thanks to the recent Eth received into our treasury, we have a chance to revisit this without the downside of converting Mana.\n\n#### On Smart Contract Risk:\n\nSmart contract risk is not zero - However rocket pool has been thoroughly battle tested as a permissionless way to achieve pooled staking. As a decentralized metaverse, we should seek to enable ourselves through equally decentralized protocols. For this reason, I believe the lowest risk possible is to avoid other pooled staking solutions even as a hedge. While useful, we cannot risk that they are not locked as a permissionless smart contract or have custodian aspects (i.e. Lido/stEth)\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/onKEnav.png)\n\n#### On Execution:\n\nThe current multi-sig signers should feel comfortable with a one-time conversion to rEth, as this does not require any price action timing, since rEth merely represents the current Ethereum available to be un-staked.

    "title": "Deposit up to 50% of DAO's Ethereum into MANA LPs",
    "body": "> by 0x8b257b97c0e07e527b073b6513ba8ea659279b61 (Morph)\n\n### Proposal:\n\nDeposit up to 50% (170 Ethereum) of the current eth (340) held by the DAO paired with mana into decentralized exchange LPs in the polygon and ethereum network. (TBD exactly which networks/exchanges within the draft process discussion)\n\n#### Reasoning:\n\nA key component of any decentralized economy is liquidity depth; without decentralized exchange liquidity, many people lose access to the DCL economy or are unfairly punished via high slippage despite using the decentralized system as intended.\n\nBy providing a sustainable and permanent liquidity well, the DCL DAO will earn a native Eth & mana income to strengthen the economy, while also reducing the total slippage as we sell MANA for grants - protecting our treasury as less price depreciation occurs and reducing overall fee-extraction (sandwich bots/CEX arbitrage etc.).\n\n#### Logistics\n\nI would recommend placing the mana/eth into the following LPs - this is up for debate:\n50% Uniswap on Eth mainnet\n40% Quickswap on Polygon ZK network\n10% Quickswap on polygon PoS network\n\n#### On Fees:\n\nFees will become a crucial income for two reasons, the first is that they will accrue both in eth and in mana, enabling us to grow the LP further for free - or to accrue Eth/Mana for the treasury itself.\n\n#### On Impermanent Loss:\n\nImpermanent loss is the event where simply holding the tokens provided to the LP long term (Eth & Mana) would provide a better USD return even after accounting for fees due to the changing price ratios. This may occur and is entirely dependent on market activity.\n\nI really see there being two core outcomes on a spectrum here:\n\nIf we continue to succeed, and mana at the least can retain a majority of its value from here, or hopefully, increase in market cap relative to Eth, then we stand to gain great value overall from fees as well as increasing our ratio of Eth available in the LP that can fund the DAO without solely relying on mana’s liquidity.\n\nIn the opposite case that Mana goes down from here, or that eth greatly appreciates in value vs mana, we are likely to suffer losses from our overall treasury value, in which case securing long term yield that does not rely on vesting/market-activity as well as rebuilding the MANA treasury is an equally beneficial use case, the risk of IL is not zero, but we are heavily weighted to betting on ourselves, and at the least, providing a permanent liquidity net that earns us a diverse income.\n\nThis makes a complex discussion of IL a weighted argument, even in a scenario where we lose market value and suffer from IL in lost eth, we have at least captured more fees and a return of mana to the DAO long term should we at any point succeed again.\n\n#### On Execution:\n\nThe current multi-sig signers should feel comfortable with a one-time LP deposit into well-known and reputable decentralized exchanges - as this does not require selling any MANA on the open market, we do not need to worry about speculation and execution strategy on conversions. The multi-sig signers themselves should feel free to address this directly if necessary or if it is considered not a feasible request of their duties.\n\n#### Closing Thoughts:\n\nI believe the DAO has a fiduciary duty to provide a LP that the community can rely on, we stand to benefit in multiple ways and it would provide a healthy function that strengthens both mana and the DAO. Even should IL occur, the net benefit to the overall economy in the long term can be appreciated should we at any point succeed as a metaverse ecosystem - in any outcome, we will either end up with more mana, or more eth - earning an income in both along the way with a positive impact on mana price.\n\n- Convert 0% of the Ethereum held\n- Convert 10% of the Ethereum held\n- Convert 25% of the Ethereum held\n- Convert 50% of the Ethereum held\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

WHY?\nBecause gas fees are too high\nWhat does this cause?\n\\-Lower number of minted names.

This document outlined the vision to refine the SDK to its ideal form - an open protocol for creating metaverse content-. This envisioned SDK would be open to any platform that chooses to adopt it, fostering collaboration and accessibility in the metaverse landscape.\n\nAfter months of dedicated effort, incorporating valuable community feedback during alpha and beta releases, [Foundation announced that SDK 7 is ready](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/announcing-sdk-7-beta).\nIn the current Grants Program Framework there's no requirement to the projects funded by the DAO to make the deliverables compatible with the latest version of the SDK, and this governance proposal is thought to update the documentation and make this a requirement.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal aims to make a new requirement for grants applications, to be added to the Grants Program Framework as follows:\n\n“The deliverables of projects funded by the DAO through the Grants Program should be built or compatible with the last stable Decentraland SDK.”\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis approach ensures that grant-funded projects align with the most current and robust technical standards, allowing for enhanced performance, integration, and overall quality.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Applicants can seek smaller, short-term grants, thereby reducing the need to liquidate substantial MANA holdings. For instance, requesting funds for a two-month period rather than committing all MANA resources for six or twelve months. Furthermore, project beneficiaries can apply for multiple grants over time to sustain their initiatives.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nSet a ceiling for each proposal, equivalent to 20% of the quarterly budget allocated to the specific category.\nDiscourage the freezing of grants to ensure a continuous flow of project support.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this proposal addresses a critical concern in the current decentralized landscape, where the DAO's financial stability is threatened by the ongoing bear market. The motivation behind this proposal stems from the need to safeguard the DAO's funds while also promoting a more inclusive and dynamic ecosystem. By limiting grants per proposal to 20% of the category's quarterly budget and rejecting the idea of freezing grants, we not only prevent undue drain on resources but also foster a more agile and resilient support system for projects.\n\nThe intended impact of this solution is multifaceted. It not only ensures the sustainability of the DAO's financial health but also encourages a broader range of participants to engage with their innovative ideas. Through this approach, we aim to strike a balance between responsible resource management and providing the necessary impetus for ongoing project development.\nIn essence, this proposal encapsulates a proactive response to the challenges posed by market fluctuations while nurturing an environment of continuous growth and collaboration within the decentralized realm. It is our conviction that by embracing these limitations and focusing on sustainable progress, the DAO can chart a path towards enduring success and impactful contributions.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xd4f1cab694c4424c4796549edbb9b489789f4df5 (TudaMoon)\n\n### Problem\n\nCurrently, you only need one (1) proposal to get a grant approved, but you need three (3) to revoke a malicious grant. Currently, we have a Grant Support Squad and a Revocations Committee implemented by the DAO. These current processes are NOT permanent solutions as they must be re-enacted by the DAO in order to continue. The DAO always has the ability to make the final decisions over grants; whether it means overriding the GSS or Revocations Committee through a DAO proposal, or bypassing the GSS or Revocations Committee through a DAO proposal.\n\nThe current problem with the DAO proposal for grant revocations or overriding GSS or Revocations Committee's decisions is that it takes way too much time before a grant's vesting contract is paused. Three (3) proposals takes too long while the DAO funds have potential to be drained.\n\n### Solution\n\n1.  Create a new proposal Category for DAO called *Grant Revocation.* There are two (2) ways this category could be used:\n    *   This Category would be for overriding Grant Support Squad Decisions or overriding Revocations Committee Decisions.\n    *   This Category would be to start the Revocations process bypassing the Grant Support Squad and Revocations Committee.\n2.  This new Category would come with a new process of revocation.\n    *   There will be 2 proposals total.\n        *   First revocation stage if passed (in favor of revoking) by DAO would **pause** the vesting contract for the grant in question.\n        *   Public Hearing will occur prior to the second revocation stage and only after the first revocation stage passes.\n        *   Second revocation stage will determine whether the grant is revoked or not revoked. If revoked, the vesting contract will be terminated indefinitely and funds will be returned back to the DAO. If not revoked, the vesting contract will un-pause and continue as is. However time lost to the grantee will be extended to allow time for grantee to catch up on roadmap.\n\n### Public Hearing Process\n\n*This is a suggested way for the process to work, but can be altered in next stages of this governance proposal process to improve it.*\n\nPreferably Public Hearings will be take place on Discord in the Decentraland DAO Discord or on a Twitter Space. However, no one can be blocked or rejected from entering the public hearing. And it must be done at a reasonable time. A quorum of eight (8) DAO members who are not related to the grant must be present for the public hearing. All Public Hearings will be recorded.\n\n**Grantee will have an Opening Statement** that can last ten (10) minutes maximum where evidence and such can be shown. After the opening statement, there will be a **DAO Questioning Period** where each member of the DAO will be allowed to ask up to three (3) questions, with one (1) follow up per question. This DAO questioning period can only last up to one (1) hour total. However responses of these questions must be direct and must be relevant. Any delay of time by the grantee's answer will extend the questioning period. After the DAO questioning period, **Closing Statements** will occur. The Grantee will give a closing statement for up to three (3) minutes. Up to three (3) members of the DAO will be allowed to give closing statements up to one (1) minute each  for a total of three (3) minutes. The DAO can have less than three (3) members give a closing statement, but the total allocated time is three (3) minutes total.\n\nA vote 'For' this would move this to the next governance stage. A vote 'Against' would end this pre-proposal.\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This list can only be modified after passing a vote by the community that is then enacted on-chain by the DAO Committee.” for banned NAMEs.\n\nLooking for reasons on why a Decentraland NAME would be banned, I stumbled upon the “DAO User Guide” - where it states, “The “banned name” list includes offensive or harmful avatar and location names that are not permitted in Decentraland. Any names on this list cannot be claimed, used, or transferred between users. To suggest banning a name, you can use the Name ban proposal category in the DAO.”\nI found this to be unaligned with the current “Terms of Use”,\n12.4 Ownership and management of LAND, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Content created by users. Which shares similarities with the ENS DAO Constitution under\n“I. Name ownership shall not be infringed” - protecting one of the main core values of Blockchain technology and Decentralization, ownership and control over one’s data, digital assets and online identity.\n\nThe purpose of this poll is to obtain feedback and gauge community sentiment around proposing to work on setting up specific criteria for which a Decentraland NAME would be eligible for a ban instead of it being “Ban an offensive name from Decentraland” as this seems too vague at the moment. Example: NAMEs of racist and/or predatory nature.\n\nDocs: DAO Smart Contracts - https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/what-smart-contracts-does-the-dao-control/\nDAO User Guide - https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/dao-userguide/#-name-ban\nTerms of Use - https://decentraland.org/terms/\nENS DAO Constitution - https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/ens-dao-constitution\n\nGreat reads:\n\n“How does the taking of offense happen?

    "title": "Should we remove the Strategic Unit and prevent $32k in DAO funds from being spent? ",
    "body": "> by 0x0dd1338a416af72655aacfbccf082762973cceff (Mimsy)\n\nThe Strategic Unit was originally created via this proposal: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b51854d0-1666-11ee-93a7-ed9294f83f74\n\nI am creating this poll to gauge the community's sentiment on how the Strategic Unit is working so far, and if it should continue as planned, receiving $32,000 in DAO funding for its work.\n\nThis issues I take with the Strategic Unit continuing on are as follows:\n\n1.  The initiatives laid out in the Strategic Unit grant proposal are things that either are currently being done (see https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c942aa60-443c-11ee-ab1f-97157a05bdec) or could be done (see https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8f846090-c811-11ed-a454-057e86adfb11) by Core Units that are already being funded. It would seem more appropriate to revise the responsibilities of the Core Units that already exist to cover these tasks, as they generally seem to fall under what could be the jurisdiction of the existing units, than to fund one person to do these tasks.\n2.  LordLike has taken action that seems contradictory to values that should be held by a person in a DAO position. This includes resubmitting a proposal that did not pass without significant change or transparency (see https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=6f77cf10-3861-11ee-aec9-fb54fc0c7896 and https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=205e00a0-4173-11ee-aa49-bbddd046ff94). When asked about this in the DAO discord, LordLike continued to lack transparency, and to point fingers at other proposals that were resubmitted with reasonable cause (like overwhelming community support but failure to reach the VP threshold). In my opinion, these situations are not the same and should not be used as evidence to justify the action being taken here.\n3.  While this point is more speculative than the others, it appears that LordLike is no longer acting in the best interest of the DAO as a whole, and there is sentiment among community members as to a change in his motives since originally being approved for the Strategic Unit grant. One example of this is the initiative to revise the Land-to-MANA ratio (see https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=75cf8f80-4430-11ee-ab1f-97157a05bdec), which if passed would place an incomparable amount of voting power (VP) in the hands of a small group of people which have historically acted in their own best interest, not necessarily the best interest of the DAO. Additionally, when asked about certain stances or actions LordLike has taken, he responds in ways that are misleading and lack transparency that should be required of any person in a DAO position. For example, repeatedly citing the amount of money other Core Units have received and citing his income as $0, when in reality the grant is still in the 1-month cliff period and he is slated to receive $32,000.\n4.  Though this grant is in its first month of operation, it appears that the main items LordLike has contributed to the DAO have occurred prior to the Strategic Unit passing and efforts have seemingly fallen off since. When asked about his contributions, LordLike routinely cites three proposals (https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8f846090-c811-11ed-a454-057e86adfb11 https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=94402470-fb15-11ed-8e4f-8db7948b5171 https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fb54ea30-b928-11ed-95dc-afd12ca00986) all of which took place before the Strategic Unit was established. This shows that he was willing and able to make contributions to the DAO without receiving a significant payment. Additionally, of the three proposals cited only one has been brought beyond the poll stage, and was done so by a team of people that does not include LordLike (https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=776dbcb0-32f9-11ee-a39d-ef9ca9e669fd). There is currently little evidence available to support that the Strategic Unit is following through with the promises made in the proposal.\n\nI personally do not feel this Strategic Unit is an appropriate use of DAO funds, and the intentions  and would greatly appreciate your thoughts on the matter.\n\n- Revoke the Strategic Unit grant\n- Allow the Strategic Unit to continue \n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "DAO grants program - New Category: Community Experiences",
    "body": "> by 0xe6af22b8fd4a2fdfec9a0b18c6be9683882d70e6 (Yararasita)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[DAO grants program - New Category: Community Experiences](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c4c43270-362b-11ee-be2d-676a2489bc16)\n\n## Summary\n\n**Create a Community Experiences category** for the Decentraland DAO Grants Program, to serve the needs of our community of creators who bring people together in the reference client, generating value in community engagement.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nAfter an [analysis](https://medium.com/decentrland-dao/dao-grants-program-quarterly-insights-308913de2a29) from the Grant Support Squad on Q2 funded grants, an [open session with the community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fds9-b9geLY), hearing thoughts from the DAO on the previous [governance poll](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7872fd40-2bde-11ee-8fbb-d9eddf5c2b3f), among other conversations with several stakeholders, grantees and advisors, we are submitting this Governance Proposal to create the Community Experiences (in the previous draft  referenced as Community Experiences) category. If the proposal passes, some changes in the existing Grants Framework must be done along with its creation. This includes the proper definition of the categories to avoid overlapping in objectives, and changes in the percentages of allocation of budget in current categories. We have decided to pursue both in different draft governance proposals. This one will address the details of the Community Experiences category, including its requirements, impact metrics and the delimitations of scope of existing categories. Another draft governance proposal with the name “DAO GRANTS PROGRAM - BUDGETARY REDISTRIBUTION” will address the percentages of allocation of budget. From the Categories definition and scope, we suggest to make the following specifications: **In world building** (current In-world content): Aims to build architecture to populate Land. The experiences can be scenes and games for Decentraland users through in-world. **Community experiences** (this proposal): Aims to bring people together in-world and generate community engagement. This can include creating wearables and emotes, or organizing events to gather with others and ignite fun community interactions. **Social Media** (currently has the same name): Aims to generate social media content to bring new audiences to Decentraland. The other categories (Documentation, Platform, Core Units, Sponsorship and Accelerator) will remain the same.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs stated in the poll, During Q2 which finished in June 2023, [we detected grant proposals that could fit into two or more categories](https://medium.com/decentrland-dao/dao-grants-program-quarterly-insights-308913de2a29), and that there are great projects that are not addressed by our program. One example is the type of grant that aims to onboard new members to Decentraland for specific target audiences, like [DCL Brazil](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a7833c20-e2bf-11ed-ae6b-bdc7e2b26a35). In this case, the grantee requested a Documentation Grant, which was not compliant with the Category, but the proposal was valuable for community building and onboarding new members. There are also valuable DAO members that make community-building experiences and events, like [ABC Decentraland](https://twitter.com/ABCDecentraland), or [CBD - Community Building Decentraland](https://twitter.com/CBDecentraland) who share knowledge with newcomers and ignite interaction among Decentraland users and DAO members. On the other hand, in the near past, the community has voted YES for the [Ambassadors Program](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=52de99e0-f27c-11ed-9bc2-e5fe350d0c93), and one of the principal objectives was to empower community members. We strongly agree with the spirit of the proposal, and think it would be a good investment to support these valuable community stewards that make the experience in Decentraland more exciting and fun. With these inputs, we hosted an open session with the community to discuss the creation of a new category in the Grants program, named Community Experiences, and we created a poll. We also consulted with several stakeholders, grantees and advisors to gather valuable insights in building this proposal.\n\n**Concerns so far that have been taken into account:**\n\n*   The community has expressed the concerns of not closing the possibility of newcomers to be able to submit proposals, so we have deleted the requirement posted in the poll regarding the “Demonstrated commitment to community building within Decentraland: Proven track record of organizing and facilitating community events, initiatives, or educational programs” as we agree that we don’t want to close the possibility of new creators to join us in building a Metaverse owned and created by its users. We want to be open, welcoming and friendly to our fellow creators who want to join us in this quest. We have added track record as something that is valuable in the brief description, and not as a requirement.\n*   The community has expressed the concern of adjusting this proposal to not only mention the reference client, as there are other clients being developed and maintained. We do not aim to disencourage the development, use,  maintenance or promotion of other reference clients, so we have changed the scope from reference client to in-world, to cover them.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Name of new category**: Community Experiences\n\n**Brief description**: Aims to bring people together in-world to generate community engagement. This can include creating wearables and emotes, or organizing events to gather with others and ignite fun community interactions. A proven track record of organizing and facilitating community events, initiatives, or educational programs is highly valuable.\n\n**Category Requirements**:\n\n*   Define how your project will contribute to community building in the Decentraland Ecosystem.\n*   Development of attractive experiences in Decentraland that generate retention of users in the form of events, exchanges of wearables, emotes or other interactions consumed by players in-world.\n*   The proposal should include how you will collaborate with other community builders, Core Units, or projects to foster cross-community partnerships.\n*   The proposal should include the development of resources, tutorials, or guides that help explore the Decentraland Metaverse or onboarding new community members for these experiences.\n\n**Impact metrics**:\n\n*   Number of community members engaged or impacted through Community Experiences initiatives. This can be measured by event attendees, wearables minted, or other pertinent metrics based on the specific proposal.\n*   Feedback and testimonials from community members regarding the value and impact of the proposal’s contributions. This can be shown in the monthly updates of the grant as quotes from users who come to the community building experiences or other stakeholders. - Growth and activity metrics of the community platforms, scenes in-world forums, or social media groups facilitated by these Community Builders.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nWith the Category impact metrics, we will be able to measure in the next Quarters, which is the real impact this category has in our platform in terms of community engagement, participation, and new users. The main goal of this proposal is to better serve grantees, have successful projects, and grow the community of creators. By measuring the number of community members engaged, hearing the feedback and testimonials of community members and growth of users in the referent client, we will measure the success of the category itself.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nFor the implementation of this category, we need to follow the next steps:\n\n*   **Allocation of category budget**: We need to reach a consensus with the Decentraland DAO community to understand how much money we need to allocate for this category. A governance proposal is being drafted to address this need.  A poll has passed. A draft governance proposal was rejected. The next step is to make an open session with the community to gather inputs, thoughts and things we need to take into account to upload a second governance draft proposal to achieve this purpose.\n\n*   **Coordinate with the GovApp team**: After the category budget is set, we need to coordinate with the Governance Squad, who is the team in charge of the technical implementation in our platform. This includes the changing of the json file that allocates the percentage of funds for each Q, and the addition of the category in the grants request page, plus adding a new form specifically for this category.\n\n*   **Update documentation**: While the changes are done, the grant support squad has to implement these changes in the Grants documentation page.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe implementation of the Community Experiences category would help the Decentraland Grants Program by covering the needs of the Decentraland members who make an outstanding work building community, and generating fun experiences in-world, igniting valuable engagement. In the past, this type of creators haven’t been able to successfully apply to grants under the current categories as their activities and impact metrics would fall under two or more categories, or were not covered by our current categories. It would also help us better define the categories objectives, like Social Media (which would aim to to bring people from other communities to Decentraland) and In-world Content (which would aim to build architecture to populate land with games and builds) and add this Community Experiences category (which would aim to generate engagement), allowing each of these categories to cover specific needs.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

I think night mode has been a preferred setting in DCL since I started ... I still hear people stating to turn on Night mode.  I'll list a few reasons below (mostly copy/paste, but you get the point) ... it may help the community as a whole having dark mode, who knows :P\n\nBetter Sleep:\nWhen it gets dark, your brain naturally begins to produce more melatonin, the chemical that makes you sleepy. Any type of light can disrupt the melatonin levels, so people should ideally avoid all types of light as bedtime approaches.\n\nReduce Power Usage:\nThe idea behind Dark Mode is that it reduces the light emitted by device screens while maintaining the minimum colour contrast ratios required for readability.  Reducing the power needed and/or used to display.\n\nReduced Eye Strain:\nDark mode users find reading easier in low light with less eye strain.  In certain situation Bright mode works better and in certain situation Dark mode works better for eye strain.  Having this option helps us users cater to bright or dark rooms.\n\nMost of us just prefer it:\nOn most any poll dark mode is the preferred setting.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd a dark mode setting to all DCL websites/UI screens/etc.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nAll users and future users of Decentraland.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nDark mode is a commonly accepted option on most all popular digital sites and such.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Organizational Chart for Decentraland DAO  [Draft]",
    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (StrategicUnit)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Organizational Chart for Decentraland DAO  [Draft]](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fa8e74c0-0f7e-11ee-bb17-db98a4ce871d)\n\n## Summary\n\nCreate an Organizational Chart for Decentraland DAO that clearly outlines all its Core Units - teams that provide core infrastructure and operations for the DAO; their roles and responsibilities within the Decentraland DAO.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nCreating an Organizational Chart for Decentraland DAO will foster transparency, accountability, and a better understanding of the governance structure.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal arises from the need for a clearer understanding of the Decentraland DAO's structure.\n\nAn Organizational Chart will provide a transparent view of the DAO's governance, allowing Community members to easily comprehend the roles and responsibilities of each DAO Core Unit. This will lead to more efficient collaboration, improved accountability, better communication, and the ability to identify and address potential governance gaps.\n\nOrganizational Chart will simplify and streamline DAO’s governance processes, making them more effective and transparent.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n1.  The DAO Organizational Chart should include:\n\n*   Core Units: The chart should identify the various Core Units and their members.\n\n*   Roles and Responsibilities: Each DAO Core Unit should contain a comprehensive  list of roles and responsibilities, detailing the key functions and activities undertaken by its members.\n\n*   Transparent Accountability: The chart should clearly indicate which Core Units are responsible for each section of the DAO, fostering accountability.\n\n2.  DAO Organizational Chart should be added to the **[Decentraland DAO Documentation](https://docs.decentraland.org/)**.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nBest Case Scenario:\n\n*   The chart clarifies and helps to understand DAO's organizational structure bringing smoother onboarding.\n\n*   The chart leads to better communication between Core Units and faster decision-making.\n\n*   The chart helps to find potential governance gaps.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\n*   Without timely updates, the chart might not reflect the current DAO structure, leading to misunderstanding.\n\n*   If not clearly presented, certain aspects of the chart might be open to multiple interpretations, causing potential confusions or disagreements.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n1.  Strategic Unit will make the text and visualization of the Organizational Chart.\n\n2.  The Governance Squad will publish the Organizational Chart in the **[ Transparency](https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/)** section of the Decentraland website.\n\n3.  The Strategic Unit will publish the Organizational Chart in the **[DOCS](https://docs.decentraland.org/)** section of the Decentraland website.\n\n4.  Governance Squad with Strategic Unit will update the Organizational Chart whenever there's a new Core Unit or other changes in the DAO's structure. Strategic Unit will provide a write-up which will be added to the chart.\n\nDate of implementation and enforcement(enaction) of this proposal must not be later than 01.01.2024.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe development of a Decentraland DAO Organizational Chart is a step towards a more transparent, accountable, and effective governance structure. This tool will not only benefit the current members and teams within the DAO but will also be instrumental for new members who wish to contribute to the Decentraland DAO's mission. By implementing this proposal, we can ensure a better understanding of our DAO's structure, promote efficient collaboration, enhance accountability, and improve communication within the DAO.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Through votes in the DAO, the Community can have a say in important aspects of the virtual world, including grants, POIs, Names, policies, catalyst nodes, LAND and Estate smart contracts, and any other issues the Community deems relevant.\n\nA vote on similar topics took place in **[ 2019](https://agora.decentraland.org/polls/8381275e-d08c-4b0c-940d-46fd49e35c3a)** and **[2020](https://agora.decentraland.org/polls/0387cebc-31a3-4e12-a7b4-e9926dd5b392)**. It would be insightful to understand the DAO's thoughts in 2023.\n\nThis is a non-binding **[Pre-Proposal Poll](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/what-can-you-do-with-the-dao/)** created to gauge Community sentiment.\n\n**DETAILS**\n\nThe current ratio for LAND-to-MANA when participating in the DAO voting is 1 LAND = 2000 MANA. The following are potential options for the new ratio:\n\n1 LAND = 1000 MANA\n\n1 LAND = 3000 MANA\n\n1 LAND = 4000 MANA\n\nIf you have other ideas please leave your opinion in the comments.\n\n**VOTING OPTIONS**\n\nYES: Revise LAND to MANA ratio.\n\nNO: Leave as it is.\n\n- YES\n- NO\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Stronger Documentation for the DAO",
    "body": "> by 0xaca8fbbdddfce169114f344d8ee739bde665f4f4 (Seanny)\n\nShould the problem/opportunity outlined be refined and taken to the next level?\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nI feel more work can be done in expanding our documentation as a DAO; both internally, and externally.\n\nInternal Documentation:\nhttps://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/what-is-the-dao/\n\nExternal Documentation examples:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentraland\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization\n\nCurrently, the only reference to Decentraland's DAO on wikipedia is the following:\n\n> Users have minted NFTs of avatars with slurs in their names, and at one point the name \"Jew\" was for sale for $362,000.\\[3] In November 2021 the community held a vote on whether to add \"Hitler\" to the banned names list, but there were not enough votes for the decentralized autonomous organization's (DAO) smart contract to execute.\n\nI feel we need a refresher, and this building period may be a good moment for us focus on the pioneering of **decentralized governance in a virtual world**, whilst the foundation works on the platform.\n\nInternally, our internal documentation can use a refresher, which many new users (albeit low in volume now) struggle to find, use and utilise to their advantage when attempting to engage with the DAO.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe proposed solution has two fronts:\n\n\\-> Refining the nature of internal documentation; building a stronger appoach to precedent-setting and value-setting in the DAO\n\\-> Expanding and exposing external documentation; both with good SEO principles, and strategic audience targeting, focused on our strengths.\n\nInternal documentation can be better refined by giving an accurate historical representation of the DAOs past decisions, alongside founding ideals at the heart of the DAO and its bodies, with the aim of clarifying and strengthening precedents and decisions already set.\n\nThis documentation, I feel, can be crucial in allowing us to collectively take better decisions. It can give us the information we need to collectively understand the tools at our disposal, and if needs be, give us the shared foundations we would need to cooperatively expand, mold and develop the DAO into a system that better represents our expectations.\n\nImportant Point:\n\\-> Documentation must be compiled without bias.\n\\-> Community must be the final arbiter of the compiled documentation.\n\\-> Documentation process must be done **in public**.\n\n> Public documentation should be done on the **forums** and not on platforms like Google Docs. Documenters must engage with, and if necessary, accept suggestions from community members. Documenters are allowed to have a technical opinion, but not a political one.\n> \\-> Should discussions on content lead to long-drawn debates, where technical and political opinions disagree, the debate itself can, and should, be settled by an open community poll. This is the only way we can set a collaborative precedent for the development of our documentation, which represents the DAO's history, and values.\n> \\-> Grant proposal must already have a plan in relation to the organization and presentation of context. In principle, the documenters will have no right to decide context, beyond the technical scope of collecting information, and when necessary, providing a public interpretation.\n> \\-> Should gaps in technical documentation be found, in relation to founding practices/precedents/values in the DAO, opportunities for relevant governance decisions may present themselves, which should be addressed before the completion of the documentation.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nThe target audience of this proposal is individuals with an interest in the policy side of decentralized governance who appreciate the importance (and ultimate necessity) of documentation, best practices, past precedents, and guiding documents in the process of setting policy and fostering good governance.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nA large portion of our Documentation budget remains unspent, which is a category very close to my heart. Decentraland's SDK documentation served as my first exposure to code, and gave me the introduction I needed to software development.\n\nAs a student of political science, I wish to be able to say the same thing about our DAO's documentation, in relation to the field of good governance and political philosophy, and good documentation plays a fundamental role in ensuring that.\n\nAt its best, the innovative nature of our DAO (and its palpable relationship to a virtual world) remains one of Decentraland's strongest features. At its worst, the still-developing, adolescent nature of our DAO can be one of Decentraland's most prevalent weaknesses; distracting the entity from finding common ground when making decisions that can shape the future of the platform.\n\nThis pitch aims to **start a conversation about documentation**, and what exactly we can and should aim for when assessing this strategic priority. I feel now is a good time to look at the accessibility and presentation of documentation as a key pillar that can allow us to find more common ground and collectively make more cohesive, tangible decisions across the community.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The GSS's job is to support grantees in the execution of their grant, however at the moment they are also tasked with judging what should be sent to the revocation committee. In order to relieve some of the workload of the GSS and specify goals of each squad, I propose making a new GAS who's primary focus is keeping grantees accountable. The main duties of this squad would be going over financial statements, checking grants for metrics of success, and updating the community on the current status of grants. We have all seen corruption run rampant in the DAO and there are currently hardly any repercussions for bad actors. In the current system, We rely on the community to identify grant abuse and report it, this report then may or may not be passed on to the revocation committee with little to no transparency.  This is a broken system because it relies on the abuse to be so outrageous community members take it upon themselves to try and get something done. The GAS would serve as a committee that actively seeks out grant abuse, checks in on the status of every grant, and updates the community in a clear and transparent way. Payment and personnel will be determined in later rounds of this proposal.

As you all know, the indigenous community has been marginalized IRL, and I for one, as I am sure many of you, do NOT want to see that continue in the new world we are creating in the Metaverse.  To help right this injustice, I am starting a campaign to reach out to these indigenous communities and help them join Decentraland.\n\nTo facilitate this outreach, we must create a safe space where the indigenous community members feel at home and provide the appropriate attire (wearables) for them.  I am requesting funding in MANA to fund this noble endeavor.  As you know, the natives like to run free and require a lot of land to do so, so we need a large space, probably at least 2x2.  (We will need more later!)  Additionally, we will require enough MANA to mint at least 5 different wearables to represent the tribal culture and traditions.  We are going to start small, but hopefully grow quickly once the natives arrive.  Initially, we will prepare for 100 natives to join our community, and I will be responsible for minting names for each tribal member and helping to acclimate them to out global community.\n\nBelow is the small budget that we require to start our project.\n\nFunding Allocation\n\n2 x 2 Estate = 20,000 MANA\n5 Wearables = $500 USD / $0.3 USD per MANA = 1666.67 MANA\n100 Names = 100 x 100 MANA = 10000 MANA\nManagement for Tribal Affairs = 2000 MANA per month x 3 months = 6000 MANA\n\nFor the small sum of 37666.67, we can help to engage the indigenous community and provide them a warm welcome in Decentraland!\n\nThank you all and many blessings!

    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (StrategicUnit)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should the Community Be the Final Arbiter in Grants Revocation Decisions ?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=78bacea0-2fa2-11ee-a512-65477fceb1b0)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to determine whether the Decentraland Community should have the final say in the revocation of Grants through the DAO governance process, thereby aligning the decision-making process with the principle of decentralization.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal emphasizes the existing procedure where the Grant Support Squad and Revocations Committee can initiate a preventive pause or revocation of the Grant Vesting Contract when potential concerns are raised. However, this proposal suggests an enhancement to this process: the final decision on the revocation of the Grant Vesting Contract would be subject to the outcome of a Community vote. If the Community vote is in favor of the Grantee and against the revocation, the Grant Vesting Contract won't be revoked. In such a case, any preventive pause that had been initiated would be lifted and the Grant Vesting Contract along with its payments would be continued, and vice versa.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Decentraland DAO is the decision-making tool for MANA, NAMES and LAND holders in Decentraland’s virtual world. The DAO’s Grants Program is one of the best vehicles to help grow the Decentraland ecosystem and must be aligned with the main spirit of\nDecentraland - Decentralization. Currently, the revocation of Grants is done by the Revocations Committee, which may not fully reflect the Community's will. This proposal suggests that while the Revocations Committee should continue to exist and make the initial decision on whether a grant should be revoked, the final decision should rest with the Community, providing a safeguard mechanism to override the Committee's decision if necessary. Grants revocation decisions should not be delegated to a small group of individuals, instead, they should be resolved through the DAO's governance process, which was designed as a legitimate tool to mirror the Community's sentiments.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nFor a detailed overview of the proposed amendments, please refer to the **[Complete Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ak0TE7kigK50JhM1NNO0XPdCe7wj8hp4vm90ksQXpdk/)**.\n\nThese amendments are intended for integration into the current **[Revocations Committee Framework](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VPb33QdeFlg-qnmclWZF2Ll\\_3USLUnFO/)**.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy allowing the Community to override the decisions of the Revocations Committee through the DAO governance process, we can ensure that the Grants Program remains a true reflection of the Community's desires and needs. The Revocations Committee will still play a crucial role in evaluating cases and making initial decisions, but also that the Community has a say. It strikes a balance between the need for specialized decision-making and the principle of decentralization.This proposal seeks to enhance the grant revocation process by aligning it with governance process and equip the Community with a clear protocol for handling relevant cases, thereby making procedure simpler and optimizing time.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This proposal seeks to create a comprehensive document that will encompass various aspects of the DAO's activities.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs the Decentraland DAO continues to experience rapid growth and attract incremental participation from diverse community members and stakeholders, the need for a robust Code of Ethics becomes increasingly evident.\n\nA diverse community brings fresh perspectives and ideas, but it also poses challenges related to potential conflict escalation. Without a well-defined framework and clear guidelines for moderators to apply rules fairly and consistently, there is a risk of subjective decision-making and inconsistency in enforcing standards of conduct.\n\nBy establishing a comprehensive Code of Ethics, the DAO aims to create a better and more welcoming space for new joiners and a safer space for the current community members. This framework will promote transparency, fairness, and inclusivity, providing a solid foundation for all community members to participate and contribute with confidence.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Decentraland DAO's Code of Ethics will be founded on core principles, including fairness and inclusivity, privacy and data protection, open decision-making, and conflict resolution. These guiding values form the foundation for cultivating an ecosystem that is inclusive, secure, and accountable.\n\nThis document is structured into distinct sections to encompass a comprehensive framework that guides the behavior and interactions of all community members:\n\nI. **Preamble**: In this introductory section, the Code sets forth the fundamental values and overarching principles that underpin the DAO's ethical foundation.\n\nII. **Core Principles and Guidelines**: This section outlines the key principles that form the backbone of the Code of Ethics. These principles serve as guiding lights for all participants, fostering a culture of collaboration, openness, and responsible conduct.\n\nIII. **Rules of Engagement**: The Code further defines specific rules and guidelines for community engagement and communication. It explicitly prohibits excessive attacks, insults, trolling, flaming, bullying, baiting for arguments, and the use of offensive language towards others. This section ensures a safe and respectful environment for all members to express their views and ideas freely.\n\nIV. **Enforcement Mechanisms**: This section addresses the enforcement mechanisms of the Code of Ethics. It outlines the procedures and consequences for non-compliance with the established ethical standards.\n\nV. **Closing**: final statement.\n\n[**CODE OF ETHICS FINAL VERSION**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hzRuIz62q4SsliYObqDmsFMKXNo3fS4w/view?usp=sharing)\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe implementation of the code of ethics within the Decentraland DAO is anticipated to have several positive impacts on the community and its overall functioning. On one hand, It will create a more respectful and tolerant environment, fostering a culture of kindness and understanding. On the other hand, It will discourage toxic behavior, personal attacks, and offensive language, to promote healthy discourse and more productive discussions on Decentraland and governance topics.\n\nThe establishment of clear guidelines agreed by the community for behavior and content will also mitigate the risk of harmful or malicious activities, such as hate speech, scams, and impersonation, thereby safeguarding the community from potential harm. Moreover, public tracking of strikes and sanctions by designated Moderators will enhance transparency and accountability in enforcing these guidelines.\n\nThis code will act as a backbone and a framework for Moderator(s) and DAO Teams to foster a safe, welcoming and respectful environment\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nIf the proposal garners the necessary support and passes, the Code of Ethics will be activated and enforced starting from 00:00 hours of the following day of its approval. To maintain transparency and accountability, the designated Moderator(s) responsible for this role will maintain a publicly accessible record that tracks strikes and sanctions issued in accordance with the Code of Ethics.\n\nThe process of re-affirming or amending the Code of Ethics entails the submission of a Binding Governance Proposal, requiring the approval of the proposal with 75% or more of the voting power in favor.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRecognizing the importance of actively involving all community members in the rule-making process and to ensure a truly inclusive and representative framework, rules and guidelines, the adoption of a well-structured Code of Ethics will strengthen community trust, enhance the overall experience for participants, and ensure the Decentraland DAO remains as a sustainable ecosystem for all its stakeholders.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

In effect, due to the actions of one instigator, the entire community is constantly being punished and therefore cannot effectively communicate.\n\nIn my opinion, having observed the discussions of jar0d over many months, and despite the innumerous warning he has received to cease (and many mutes), he has continued to irritate, antagonize, and intimidate good people to the point many no longer choose to participate in Decentraland discussions out of fear of being verbally attacked and abused by jar0d.\n\nWhile some have called for more forceful moderation, I believe that action is an unnecessary policing of the entire community to simply mitigate the unacceptable actions of one member.\n\nMOTIVATION\nAs I mentioned, jar0d has a very long history of being disruptive. He has received many public warnings; many have attempted to converse with him about his unacceptable behaviors privately via DMS; he has been muted many times; nothing has seemed to have worked, as he continues to this day to use the Decentraland discords and discussion forums as his personal platforms to engage in harassing, abusive, disruptive, and often libelous behaviors.\n\nSPECIFICATION\nPermanently ban jar0d from all Decentraland DAO Discord servers and permanently ban jar0d from all DAO proposal discussion Forums.\n\nMake a recommendation to the DCL Foundation that they ban jar0d from all Decentraland Foundation Discord servers and discussion Forums, as well; including in-world chat and voice communication channels, and any and all other current or future communication channels not mentioned.\n\nIMPACTS\nDecentraland DAO Community member Jar0d is currently serving a 1 week mute in the DCL DAO Discord. The impact of this short duration mute has been enormously beneficial. During this mute duration people have been freely able to engage in active productive conversations without the constant fear they previously encountered of being attacked, harassed, or interrupted by jar0d.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION PATHWAYS\nPermanently Ban user jar0d from viewing, or engaging with :\n\nAll Decentraland DAO Discord servers\nAll Decentraland DAO proposal discussion Forums.\nRecommendation to the DCL Foundation that they Permanently ban jar0d from viewing, or engaging with:\n\nAll Decentraland Foundation Discord servers\nAll Decentraland Foundation proposal discussion Forums.\nBan userJar0d from using Decentraland platform in-World discussion and voice communication.\nAny and all other current or future communication channels not mentioned.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs I mentioned, jar0d has a very long history of being disruptive. He has received many public warnings; many have attempted to converse with him about his unacceptable behaviors privately via DMS; he has been muted many times; nothing has seemed to have worked, as he continues to this day to use the Decentraland DAO discord as his personal platform to engage in harassing, abusive, disruptive, and often libelous behaviors.\n\nIf the community would like the Decentraland DAO Discord to once again be a platform where they can freely express their ideas, views, and concerns without the fear being incessantly attacked, then there must be accountability. In my opinion, those whose seemingly sole purpose of existence is to intentionally disrupt, irritate and annoy, should be permanently removed from the community.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPermanently ban jar0d from the Decentraland DAO Discord server and permanently ban jar0d from all DAO proposal discussion Forums.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nPermanently ban jar0d from the Decentraland DAO Discord server and permanently ban jar0d from all DAO proposal discussion Forums.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nPermanently ban jar0d from the Decentraland DAO Discord server and permanently ban jar0d from all DAO proposal discussion Forums.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt is my hope that all of jar0d’s victims, both past and present, read this proposal and take the necessary action to permanently ban him.\n\nIn doing so, it is my hope that the Decentraland DAO community can once again reclaim their right to engage with other members free from the fear of harassment. And approving this action will also serve as a deterrent and reminder to all others that the type of behavior that jar0d has for too long engaged in will no longer be tolerated within our community.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Decentraland Governance - Lowering Wearable Publishing Fee  ",
    "body": "> by 0xed0e0cb94f60f72ec94bef848f5df4cbd365af1d (InJesterr)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Decentraland Governance - Lowering Wearable Publishing Fee  ](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=755626d0-3919-11ee-aec9-fb54fc0c7896)\n\n## Summary\n\nAs someone deeply invested in our metaverse, I believe in our power to shape DCL. This proposal is an extension of that belief, aiming to refine the structure of wearable fees in a way to balances economic viability, inclusivity, and sustainability.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis proposal revolves around redefining the wearable submission fee, aligning it more closely with our community's ethos and the needs of our growing metaverse. By setting the fee at $100 USD, paid in MANA, and directing a portion of it to curators, the Catalyst network, and the DAO's Grants Program, we can ensure a healthy ecosystem that benefits creators, curators, and the entire Decentraland community.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nMy aim is to decrease the fees, making the Decentraland platform more appealing to new users. By reducing the fee, we increase the likelihood of new users engaging in creative endeavors. Currently, numerous projects are actively integrating with Decentraland. To entice these newcomers into releasing wearables as well, we need to establish incentives. This adjustment would yield benefits for them, the DAO, Curators, and even the Catalyst.\n\nObserving the willingness of some individuals to further reduce the fee, I am inclined to approach this gradually. Initially, I propose reducing the fee to $100, allowing us to assess its impact. This figure is both straightforward and easily divisible among the DAO, Curators, and Catalyst, providing a smooth transition.\n\n**Proposal Details:**\n\nIn this proposal, I outline a restructuring plan for the wearable submission fee that addresses various aspects of our community's needs.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Fixed USD Price, Paid in MANA:** The proposed fee is $100 USD, payable in MANA. This approach removes the concerns around crypto price volatility while offering creators a stable pricing point.\n\n**Curator Compensation:** A significant portion (30%)/($30) of the fee will be dedicated to compensating curators. Recognizing the importance of their role in maintaining quality and integrity, this compensation aligns with their responsibilities.\n\n**Catalyst Network Support:** To sustain the Catalyst network, which underpins the Decentraland experience, a portion (10%)/($10) of the fee will be directed towards supporting the hosting expenses. This ensures our platform's stability and reliability.\n\n**DAO Investment in Growth:** A substantial share (60%)/($60) of the fee will be allocated to the Decentraland DAO's Grants Program. This commitment reflects our dedication to fostering innovation, development, and the overall expansion of our metaverse.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\n**Impact:**\n\nBy reducing the fee to $100, this proposal aims to create a more appealing environment for creators to launch their wearables, thus fostering a larger pool of participants in the marketplace. This adjustment in pricing not only supports budget-conscious creators but also serves to mitigate the potential curation challenges that could arise due to low-quality submissions.\n\nFurthermore, this initiative addresses the creators' concerns about budgeting uncertainties linked to MANA fluctuations, rendering the process of project budgeting and service promotion more stable and reliable.\n\nThe suggested valuation of $100 USD for each wearable submitted strikes a balance between incentivizing creators while concurrently deterring spam submissions. This equilibrium not only encourages the influx of high-quality wearables but also underpins the fundamental financial aspects essential to sustain a wearables marketplace.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n**Implemantation**\n\nTo actualize this idea, the foundation or Security Advisory Board (SAB) should take the lead in its implementation. The following steps outline the process:\n\nFoundation/SAB Oversight:\nEnlist the support of the foundation or SAB to initiate the proposed changes. Their involvement will lend credibility and expertise to the implementation process.\n\nDAO Committee Payment Adjustment:\nTask the DAO Committee members with revising curator payments, reflecting the enhanced value of the curation process.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy reshaping the wearable submission fee structure, we empower creators, acknowledge curators, bolster the Catalyst network, and fuel the growth of our metaverse through the DAO's initiatives. This proposal reflects our community's collective aspirations and acknowledges the collaborative efforts that make Decentraland extraordinary.\n\nGiven the current minimal traffic, it would prove advantageous to engage creators who have lower operational expenses. The curation committee is in the process of expansion, considering a rate of approximately $30 for each wearable under review. This adjustment, along with channeling $60 back to the DAO & $10 to the catalyst, would significantly enhance accessibility.\n\nA reduced fee makes it appealing for new users to participate in the Decentraland creators program.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

I have brought 17 unique designs so far. The primary goal of my work is to enrich the Decentraland experience by offering a wide range of creative choices for avatar customization. Promoting both wearable creators and Decentraland while doing so. I want to continue creating #WearableWednesday posts as well as some other contents where I will post weekly outfits. My background in graphic designing and knowledge that i have in color theory allows me to bring creative contents that people would like to see.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n2,150 USD in MANA\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x531aA0845cF473A55BB5bc8cda5E04Ea5B27C726\n\n## Email address\n\nfecetdcl@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nWhy do I need the fund?\n\nMy journey in DCL started on October 5th, 2021 as my POAP collection says. Since then, tried my best on collecting and trading wearables. I didn't have any sponsorship while bringing the content and now having the scarcity of the wearables I use. Most of the fundings that I will acquire will directly go back to wearable creators because I will be able to shop more in the marketplace. I will be able to use more design applications and could give more time on creating designs.\n\nWhy should this project receive the fund?\n\nAvatars are a central element of user interaction and identification in Decentraland. I am pretty sure that most of us saw a person that we know changed their DCL name but we could identify them with their avatar. My project will significantly enhance the user experience by allowing individuals to personalize their avatars in ways that resonate with their preferences and creativity, resulting in a more immersive and enjoyable virtual world.\n\nThe Decentraland community comprises individuals with diverse tastes, interests, and backgrounds. The contents will cater to this diversity by offering a wide range of wearable outfits that appeal to various aesthetics, cultures, and styles, fostering inclusivity and representation within the platform.\n\nAs users seek out and purchase more wearables, they contribute to the demand for MANA, Decentraland's native cryptocurrency, and stimulate economic activity within the platform. This dynamic economy benefits creators, traders, and users alike.\n\nIn summary, the funding will result in a more visually diverse, engaging, and socially connected Decentraland platform. By addressing avatar personalization limitations and offering ongoing creativity, it will be enriching the overall Decentraland experience.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMonth 1:\n\nFinding wearables that will be used in the outfits.\nChoosing design tools.\nCreating templates to showcase the outfits. (4-5 times in a month, weekly period)\nPhotoshoot for the outfits. (4-5 times in a month, weekly period)\nUsing the outfit photos in the designs. (4-5 times in a month, weekly period)\nPublishing them on the social media platform. (4-5 times in a month, weekly period)\nCollecting feedback from the community regarding preferred wearable themes.\nSharing the process with the community.\nDisplaying the growth in followers, likes, retweets, and community interactions as a result of the project.\n\nMonth 2 and 3:\n\nFinding more wearables that will be used in the outfits\n(4-5 times in a month, weekly period)\nCreating templates to showcase the outfits.

However, that is why we can have badges on their name. This will give them a chance to share what happened or how they made a mistake in the past or whatever. Things happen.\n\nThe point of this is to make sure that DAO voters at least have the knowledge of the history of the grantee they are voting for.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nWe have a lot of Decentraland DAO voters who have voted in favor of grants that have been revoked.\n\nWhen a DAO voter has a previous history of voting for revoked grants, they should be recognized by other DAO members. They may still be credible, but it should be next to their name when they make comments that they have a record of voting for grants that are being revoked.\n\nThe point of this is to make sure that DAO voters at least have the knowledge of the history of other DAO voters who are commenting on the forum.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n**Solution 1:** Show a Badge next to the Grantee's name when a proposal is being made by them or if they are tagged in the proposal itself.\nThe new badges should be:\n\n*   \"Previously Revoked Grant\"\n*   \"Previously Revoked Grant with Completed Successful Grant\"\n*   \"Prevously Revoked Grant with Return Payment\"\n\n**Solution 2:** Show a Badge next to a DAO voter's name when they comment on in the Decentraland Forum or if they are tagged in the proposal itself, or are proposing the proposal.\nThe new badges should be:\n\n*   \"Voted for 5 or more Revoked Grants\"\n*   \"Voted for 10 or more Revoked Grants\"\n*   \"Voted for 10 or more Successfully Completed Grants\"\n*   \"Voted for 25 or more Successfully Completed Grants\"\n\n\\*Remember this is no fault of the voters, but it helps show their previous credibility of their judgment.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nDAO Voters and Grantees\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nCredibility is completely relevant for future grants and this credibility system will keep check on the grantees and voters.\n\nOf course anyone can make a new profile or new wallet, but reputation is usually looked at when a grant is being proposed. It makes it more difficult for people to be able to get a grant that shouldn't get it and it helps hold voters accountable.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The schedule is available [here](https://is.gd/LA8hWk).\n\nAn **Online Knowledge Base** will contain all educational program content, including materials about the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n**3 interviews with Decentraland experts** will be published on [XFounders' YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@XFounders_EN).\n\nEach video is accompanied by an article on: [XFounders Medium](https://medium.com/@XFounders) and a post on: [XFounders LinkedIn](https://is.gd/E4Yi6z).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n39,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xca748eda8F9258FaEfB944Dd3AcfB1B1520c2af4\n\n## Email address\n\ninfo.xfounders@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n### XFounders Project Genesis\n\nI will briefly tell the story of how and why the XFounders project was born. My partner and I were founders and launched projects in the web2 market. In 2021, in one of our projects - SuperPower (formerly known as workoutme) - we decided to test an MVP of a web3 product. Retention metrics increased significantly, and the transactional business model attracted us. We decided to pivot, despite having no experience in web3, despite our extensive experience in web2 (70m user acquisition in various products and over 20m revenue in fintech products).\n\nAfter spending more than 8 months trying to figure out web3, we encountered a lot of problems:\n\n*   Lack of available expertise and knowledge, competent specialists are scarce (questions like how to do marketing? how to do tokenomics? how much does token listing cost, and on which exchange is it worth doing? how much does marketing cost? where to open a company and how many are needed? how to choose a blockchain? and so on) - these questions formed the basis of the XFounders educational program.\n*   Poor onboarding to blockchains and weak support.\n*   Accelerator programs take an unjustifiably large % of the company (on average, 6% equity + 6% total token supply). Funds invest in only 0.3% of the entire pipeline. Most startups do not receive feedback and support.\n*   Projects come to accelerators and funds unprepared.\n\nAll of this slows down mass adoption. We want to fix this and make it so that projects test hypotheses faster and launch more stable products.\n\n### Value for Decentraland\n\nWe want to help 2 projects in the Decentraland ecosystem close gaps in marketing, tokenomics, business development, product, legal, in order to increase their chances of survival and help attract investments for accelerated growth. 2 Startups will have a participation grant for XFounders Boot Camp from Decentraland. This will give them a founders-friendly status within the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n### XFounders Funnel Target\n\nFrom the XFounders funnel, the target is to have 5 new startups launch MVPs in the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n**Duration:** 1 September - 1 December\n\n**Contingency:** If, for some reason, after the Offline Boot Camp certain startups fail to commit to their launch, new cohorts will be launched from the current funnel until the KPI is met.\n\n**Benefit to Decentraland Startups:** 10 Decentraland startups will have free access to the XFounders Online Knowledge Base.\n\n### XFounders Achievements and Goals\n\n**5M Audience Reach**: We aim to achieve a substantial audience reach by securing coverage from 15 media outlets and 10 Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs). Our strategy involves collaborating with various media platforms and influential individuals to amplify our presence.\n\n**Media and KOL Coverage**: Throughout the BootCamp event, we will partner with approximately 25 different media outlets, bloggers, and influencers. These partners will actively create and share content, including daily updates, articles, interviews, and live streams, engaging their respective audiences.\n\n**Onboarding 25 Startups to Decentraland**: XFounders operates as an ecosystem, introducing the next generation of founders to web3. Our unique approach involves activating dormant startup pipelines from accelerators, incubators, funds, and consulting agencies. We transform these startups into valuable contributors to the Decentraland ecosystem, successfully onboarding around 25 new projects within the next year.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### Milestone 1 - Offline Program Creation\n\n*   Preparation of topics about the Decentraland ecosystem using XFounders' methods and insights from Decentraland experts.\n*   Development of free educational content about the Decentraland ecosystem for the benefit of the Decentraland community (available on platforms like YouTube, Medium, and Telegram).\n*   Identifying potential projects to onboard onto the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n### Milestone 2 - Offline Event Provision\n\n*   Execution of an offline educational program featuring 3 topics related to the Decentraland ecosystem.\n*   Recording the educational program for the purpose of creating an online knowledge base.\n*   Conducting a Demo Day to showcase the progress and outcomes of the participants' endeavors.\n\nA closed, paid live stream of the entire Bootcamp will be conducted. Decentrolend grant recipients and key community members will be granted free access to the live stream. A total of 30 spots have been allocated for this purpose.\n\n### Milestone 3 - Educational Platform Creation + Online Knowledge Base Launch\n\n*   Development of an online platform to house the online knowledge base, featuring all materials related to the Decentraland ecosystem from the Bootcamp.\n*   Post-production work on the online program to enhance its quality and presentation.\n*   Creation of additional free educational materials, tailored for the Decentraland community, available in 15 languages.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x8218a2445679e38f358e42f88fe2125c98440d59 (1010)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Infrastructure for LANDs](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=dd5bf7c0-efe3-11ed-813c-b353c3943eab)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis governance proposal is to advance the setting up of infrastructure for LANDs use by the community.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\n4 polls were conducted and 3 conclusions were derived.\n\nCreate a specific category for LAND related matters on the DAO proposal page named \"LAND\".\nRefer to Annex (A)\n\nAll proposals will be decided on a case by case basis, including the permitted tenure as well as whether cost is involved.\nRefer to Annex (B) and (C)\n\nThe 'Acceptance Threshold' should be set at 2m Voting Power for 1 parcel, and thereafter, a dynamic threshold is triggered.\nRefer to Annex (D)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the successful passing and subsequent enacting of the LAND purchase agreement by the DAO, infrastructure should be set up to allow all members to start using LAND.\n\nThrough various consultations held in the past months, the DAO has come to an agreement to set up a process in which potential tenants can submit applications for approval by the community.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThere are 5 key goals to be achieved with this proposal.\n\nCreate a specific category for LAND related matters on the DAO proposal page named \"LANDs\".\n\nImplement an application form format for potential tenants.\nThe form will include categories such as location, title, purpose, amount of time to be occupied, rent payable PER DAY during occupancy (if any) and other information.\n\nSet the 'Acceptance Threshold' at 2m VP for the 1st parcel and 200k VP for each of the remaining parcels thereafter. The allotted time for each vote will be 7 days.\nIt'll work out as follows:\n\n1plot: 2m VP\n\n2 plots and above: 2m VP + \\[(total plots-1) x 200k VP].\nFor example, 6 plots will be 3m VP.\n\nA maximum tenure of 90 days for members and 180 days for Squads will be implemented.\n\nProposals for the use or revocation of LAND need only go through 1 round of application, similar to POIs.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nCost to buy LAND is always a consideration for developers when deploying their work inside Decentraland. Should this proposal be passed and enacted, the DAO will be able to provide the community and potential entrants with more cost effective options, thereby alleviating concerns about cost, especially in the early/developmental stages.\n\nAs renting/providing LAND to community members is a novel idea to the DAO, there will be risks involved, such as the possibility of hoarding, misuse or the lack thereof. Therefore, revision of conditions will be needed down the line depending on what issues the DAO experiences during the intial process. A review in 6 months is recommended.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nCreate a specific category for LAND related matters on the DAO proposal page named \"LANDs\".\nAll matters OTHER THAN the transfer, sale/purchase, modifying the name and contract of LAND/ESTATEs should fall under this category. This includes but is not limited to rentals, revocations, renewal of tenure etc.\n\nImplement an application form format for potential tenants. A sample of the form will be provided in the comments.\n\nSet the 'Acceptance Threshold' at 2m VP for the 1st parcel and 200k VP for each of the remaining parcels thereafter. The formula will be 2m VP + \\[(total plots-1) x 200k VP].\nThe allotted time for each vote will be 7 days.\n\nThe tenure for LANDs will be denominated in 7, 30, 60 and 90 days. A 180 days option will be available for Squads. This will be reflected in the application. All tenure will begin from the time they are successfully delegated as ‘operator’.\n\nProposals for the use or revocation of LAND need only go through 1 round of application, similar to POIs.\n\nUpon approval, if no monetary transaction is involved, the tenant will be given 'operator' permission for the stipulated time. If a monetary transaction is involved, the tenant will have to make the full transfer of the rent before being set as operator.\n\nGas fees cannot exceed 70 GWEI per transaction. This is to ensure that DAO funds are not depleted quickly should there be a surge in gas fees.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith the governance proposal for LAND purchase enacting soon, setting up the infrastructure for use of LAND is the next step. This will ensure that a proper process is present to prevent confusion as to how applications for use works.\n\nAnnex (A)\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b2344a30-e6af-11ed-b8f1-75dbe089d333\n\nAnnex (B)\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a1e99ae0-e6af-11ed-b8f1-75dbe089d333\n\nAnnex (C)\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8acd2980-e6af-11ed-b8f1-75dbe089d333\n\nAnnex (D)\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d36e9660-e957-11ed-a775-5faf35384fa8\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "A better world map experience for DCL",
    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct)\n\nShould the problem/opportunity outlined be refined and taken to the next level?\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nCurrently, the DCL world map available on the reference client lacks some features that, if present, would improve the user experience of the product, increase the discoverability of places and events in-world, and better serve metaverse explorers and LAND owners. Recently we've seen how mainstream map applications (Like Google Maps) implemented features that added activity layers to the static map features, this creates the effect of seeing if a place is lively or not. Our map does not have something like that and in order to see what's going on in-world users have to either visit the Places or Events pages or enter the world and find their way to where the action is happening.\nProjects like Genesis City or even DCL Metrics tried to fill some of those gaps but in reality, we ended up with multiple experiences to navigate the same set of parcels.\nEven though I don't see an issue with having multiple implementations, it would be good to tackle this issue in a unified way to have a reference map implementation (That could be consumed by the multiple explorer clients being developed right now).\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe idea would be to create a Decentraland Map Web App, that integrates some of the core features present in other map projects in a way that could be potentially adopted by the DCL Reference client or any other clients being developed right now.\n\nKey Features:\nActivity Indicators: Display what parcels are populated right now and the trends over time\n\nIntegrate Events: Display what is going on at that specific moment and in the upcoming days with related event metadata.\n\nThumbnail Land Customization: Land owners will have the ability to set colors and upload custom images for their respective parcels directly on the map interface.\n\nTop-Level View: The map will display a top-level view of the Decentraland metaverse, offering an easy-to-understand overview of their surrounding areas and potential collaboration opportunities.\n\nScene info and Updates: Land owners will have the option to modify their scene title, description, and thumbnail without leaving the map application, streamlining the creative process. Visitors will be able to see more metadata of the parcel they're looking at.\n\nFriends info: See where your friends are if they are online at that specific moment.\n\n(Wild idea) Navigation feature: Users could select a parcel and based on where they are, a portable experience could be triggered allowing the user to walk or run instead of teleport to get to the point they want to go.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nThe primary target audience for this Decentraland Map Web App includes land owners, content creators, developers, and explorers within the Decentraland community.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nWith the continuous growth of the Decentraland community and interest in virtual real estate, the demand for an intuitive map web application becomes important. For land owners, this could imply better discoverability and an easier workflow for their assets. For metaverse explorers, this could be a better solution to understand what is going on in Decentraland and understand where they could go, potentially increasing engagement and time spent in the platform.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xc3e3d13d98b84e1808c4145355c0cade20a2fc98 (LastSlice)\n\nShould the following $170,000 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nEvery major metaverse platform has an in-world builder - except Decentraland. This project will get people: in-world, building, and having fun as quickly and easily as possible. Let’s proudly use Decentraland to build Decentraland, in Decentraland.\n\nTo date, the Foundation has created the web Builder Tool, and 3rd party companies / individuals have created their own standalone editors and builders. At one point, The Foundation built an in-world builder too! Unfortunately, it was a release of an unfinished product; the 3rd party software and services are not ‘inside’ DCL (limiting their accessibility and usability) and require an external website and/or external software package.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n170,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe96f1c6B08b1d932Df11E78A040a75B546ab8d2B\n\n## Email address\n\nlastraum@lastslice.co\n\n## Description\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/user156016949/iwb - competition\n\nThis proposal’s goal is to make creating content within Decentraland as user-friendly and accessible as other mainstream gaming platforms. Today, creating and building quality content within DCL has a high barrier to entry, thus restricting DCL’s potential user and creator base to a more limited highly trained and technically advanced audience (or to those who can afford to pay). If broader adoption and sustainable user growth is to be achieved, the current state needs to be changed. As it stands, more user friendly and quite frankly more basic metaverses (such as Roblox) lead to user adoption for this reason.\n\nThis new In World Builder will be easy to use, require no coding, and require no deploying. Users will have immediate access to a catalog of thousands of assets, the ability to add, remove, transform assets, and the ability to upload custom assets. Most importantly it will aid DCL’s development by reducing the current barrier to entry for many creators, making DCL accessible for creators of all skill levels (and budgets).\nNo code, no deploy, real time collaboration. Better builder, functionality, and assets.\n\nThe In World Builder will be a seamless, integrated ‘in-world’ building experience, deployed by way of a multi-tiered strategy that offers DCL users the following key features:\n\n*   Everything in world: Build inside Decentraland for Decentraland.\n*   No Code, No Deploy: Easy drag & drop functionality.\n*   Upload Custom Assets\n*   Enhanced Interactive Components: IFTTT style builder for smart items.\n*   Multiplayer: Real-time, collaborative, social building sessions.\n*   Import/Export Scenes: Save scene creations for future deployment.\n*   Accessibility: Wallet free building & saving.\n*   Rewards by participation: Gamification of building.\n*   New Pathways and interactions: Developed & diverse collaborative building experience.\n\nAs part of this proposal, we also plan to introduce over 2000 new assets of various types including textures, audio files, animations, smart items, and functions grouped in exciting new themes. The new assets will enhance creativity and encourage more users to get involved in the building process. Regular ‘creator’ sessions will allow new users to learn how to best utilize the builder for their own creations. This In World Builder solution will stimulate and support sustainable creativity, establish new pathways and interactions, and significantly benefit the Decentraland platform and its users and creators.\n\n### Multi-tier Strategy\n\n*   Part 1: The In World Builder Tool\n*   Part 2: The Community Development Plaza (or Dev Plaza) - We plan to receive deployment rights to one of the duplicate Genesis City plazas. This new ‘Community Development Plaza’ (CDP) will be a central location for highlighting user builds created with the In World Builder tool. Think of the current scene pool on the Builder website but deployed in-world.\n\n### Tech Stack\n\n#### Atlas Corp. World Server\n\nEnterprise level World Server from Atlas Corp. Build in world, deploy to Genesis City.\n\n#### Microsoft Playfab\n\nA robust suite of services. It allows the IWB to track players, save data and create inventories, items, currencies, and analytics, all within a secure infrastructure built on Microsoft Azure\n\n#### Colyseus Multiplayer Architecture\n\nAllows us to represent everyone’s “live building” in real time, to each DCL user. This also allows us to create a ‘no coding’, ‘no deploy’ solution for users\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n|Task | Time | Notes |\n|--|--|--|\n|UX Conceptualization and Design  | 1st Month | Heavy focus on UX to develop the most user-friendly solution |\n|Asset Creation|1st Month| Development of 2k new assets including 3D models, animations, smart items and more.|\n|Core System Architecture | 1st Month| building the essential framework, data models, and scene configuration |\n| Marketing & Comm.| 1st Month| Develop content calendar and messaging.

    "title": "Decentraland Governance - Lowering Wearable Publishing Fee  ",
    "body": "> by 0xed0e0cb94f60f72ec94bef848f5df4cbd365af1d (InJesterr)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[: Decentraland Governance - Lowering Wearable Publishing Fee](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8e05a7f0-324d-11ee-a39d-ef9ca9e669fd)\n\n## Summary\n\nAs someone deeply invested in our metaverse, I believe in our power to shape DCL. This proposal is an extension of that belief, aiming to refine the structure of wearable fees in a way to balances economic viability, inclusivity, and sustainability.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis proposal revolves around redefining the wearable submission fee, aligning it more closely with our community's ethos and the needs of our growing metaverse. By setting the fee at $100 USD, paid in MANA, and directing a portion of it to curators, the Catalyst network, and the DAO's Grants Program, we can ensure a healthy ecosystem that benefits creators, curators, and the entire Decentraland community.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nMy aim is to decrease the fees, making the Decentraland platform more appealing to new users. By reducing the fee, we increase the likelihood of new users engaging in creative endeavors. Currently, numerous projects are actively integrating with Decentraland. To entice these newcomers into releasing wearables as well, we need to establish incentives. This adjustment would yield benefits for them, the DAO, Curators, and even the Catalyst.\n\nObserving the willingness of some individuals to further reduce the fee, I am inclined to approach this gradually. Initially, I propose reducing the fee to $100, allowing us to assess its impact. This figure is both straightforward and easily divisible among the DAO, Curators, and Catalyst, providing a smooth transition.\n\n**Proposal Details:**\n\nIn this proposal, I outline a restructuring plan for the wearable submission fee that addresses various aspects of our community's needs.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Fixed USD Price, Paid in MANA:** The proposed fee is $100 USD, payable in MANA. This approach removes the concerns around crypto price volatility while offering creators a stable pricing point.\n\n**Curator Compensation:** A significant portion (30%)/($30) of the fee will be dedicated to compensating curators. Recognizing the importance of their role in maintaining quality and integrity, this compensation aligns with their responsibilities.\n\n**Catalyst Network Support:** To sustain the Catalyst network, which underpins the Decentraland experience, a portion (10%)/($10) of the fee will be directed towards supporting the hosting expenses. This ensures our platform's stability and reliability.\n\n**DAO Investment in Growth:** A substantial share (60%)/($60) of the fee will be allocated to the Decentraland DAO's Grants Program. This commitment reflects our dedication to fostering innovation, development, and the overall expansion of our metaverse.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy reshaping the wearable submission fee structure, we empower creators, acknowledge curators, bolster the Catalyst network, and fuel the growth of our metaverse through the DAO's initiatives. This proposal reflects our community's collective aspirations and acknowledges the collaborative efforts that make Decentraland extraordinary.\n\nGiven the current minimal traffic, it would prove advantageous to engage creators who have lower operational expenses. The curation committee is in the process of expansion, considering a rate of approximately $30 for each wearable under review. This adjustment, along with channeling $60 back to the DAO & $10 to the catalyst, would significantly enhance accessibility.\n\nA reduced fee makes it appealing for new users to participate in the Decentraland creators program.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "DCL Global Recruiting & Onboarding Marketing Campaign Phygital T-shirt Contest",
    "body": "> by 0xfe06daef60ecb07fc65e8a9d0e81b82d93fd884b (jEnnova)\n\nShould the following $105,500 grant in the Sponsorship category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nFULL PROPOSAL: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rgWQhbl6g_XD-NSJb-WY974fDixswK6D3fCVD3tIx1g/edit?usp=sharing\n\nEnnova (Twitter: @ennova_io) understands the need to increase the number of users in Decentraland (DCL), specifically content creator roles such as graphic designers and 3D modelers. As such, Ennova will facilitate a global marketing campaign designed to boost user onboarding and community engagement within DCL. Our initiative will focus on recruiting people from 15+ web2 and web3 platforms to join DCL. We will host a t-shirt design contest where the winning design, which will be chosen by the community, will become the official DCL phygital t-shirt and converted to a limited-edition wearable.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n105,500 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n7 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xfE06DAEF60ecb07Fc65E8a9d0E81B82d93fd884B\n\n## Email address\n\nConcierge@ActivateEnnova.com\n\n## Description\n\nDCL has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact, socialize, & conduct business. It is vital to invest in marketing strategies that promote growth, brand awareness, & new user onboarding to fully realize this potential & remain competitive. Sponsoring this project presents an innovative approach to addressing these objectives.\n\nCost-effective Marketing: Our marketing campaign is an affordable & effective marketing strategy. Phygital t-shirts are cost effective & can be produced in large quantities, making it an accessible method to promote DCL globally. When people wear the DCL t-shirt in public, they will be walking billboards for the platform leading to word-of-mouth advertising & increased exposure for DCL. According to a BCG report, word-of-mouth marketing is up to 10x more effective than paid ads. Furthermore, McKinsey & Co reported that the importance of word-of-mouth marketing is only likely to grow with Gen-Zers as 82% of them trust their family & friends for advice on products more than any other source. What better way to empower our community members to market & promote DCL than to give them a product they’d love to wear & leverage to encourage others to join DCL.\n\nEnhanced Brand Recognition & Promotion: The creation & distribution of t-shirts featuring DCL’s logo can significantly boost brand recognition. According to a survey by PPAI, 85% of people remember the brand or business that gave them a branded or promotional product. Ennova will offer these t-shirts to both newly onboarded & existing DCL members effectively creating a network of individuals who will feel further empowered to promote DCL, ultimately increasing its visibility and reach.\n\nInnovative User Experience: Incorporating NFC tag technology into the t-shirts offers users a seamless & interactive experience. Scanning the embedded NFC tag can instantly direct them to DCL's website removing barriers to engagement & increasing the likelihood of onboarding new users. This approach will not only attract attention but also demonstrate DCL’s commitment to cutting-edge tech & user experience.\n\nCommunity Building & Engagement: Our design contest will foster community involvement & pride, as members contribute their creative skills & participate in voting for the winning design. This sense of belonging can attract new users & lead to an increase of repeat DCL visits from current users. A study by Invesp found that engaged customers visit a website 2x more often & spend 5x longer on a website than non-engaged customers. Studies like this one suggest that when customers are engaged with a brand, they are more likely to spend more time on the website & make more purchases / take other desirable actions.\n\nOffline & In-World Integration: This initiative bridges the gap between the digital & physical worlds by offering both virtual wearables in DCL & t-shirts with NFC tags. This integration will generate interest from a wider audience & create buzz around DCL, showcasing its innovative approach to the metaverse experience.\n\nThis project is beneficial to DCL. It will address current gaps in areas such as new user onboarding, marketing, & community engagement. Furthermore, it will elevate DCL’s brand awareness, drive its further growth in the metaverse market, & showcase its commitment to innovation. Ennova is excited for the opportunity to bring this project to fruition & create something monumental the whole community can be proud of!\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nEnnova will complete this project’s milestones in five (5) phases. We have provided the roadmap containing details about each phase along with a high-level flowchart in Table 1(a).\n\nTable 1(a) - Project Flowchart\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/q0TGycz.png)\n\nAdditionally, we have provided a chart containing each of the activities the Ennova team will focus on by effort. Here you will see our main area of focus is the recruitment and onboarding of new users (70%) with secondary efforts focusing on current community members (25%). Our tertiary focus is that of the t-shirts which comprises 5% of our focus throughout this engagement see Table 1(b).\n\nTable 1(b) - Ennova’s Key Activities by Effort\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/hXHObMg.png)\nGiven that our main focus will be on the recruitment and onboarding of new users, we have provided additional details about our onboarding strategies to provide more context around these efforts (see Table 1 (c)).\n\nTable 1(c) - Ennova Onboarding Strategies\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/ews3zLI.png)\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/MbCytkO.png)\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/5YNvz9S.png)\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/4vmYLAL.png)\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/8mR84rV.png)\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/alr7gga.png)\n\nTable 1(d) - Designer & Developer Prizes\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/9cYsxbd.png)\n\nTable 1(e) - Wearables Sales Proceeds Distribution\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/cZfXIB6.png)\n\nTable 1(f) - Proposal Highlights\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/BdDBpX0.png)\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

However, the current documentation system primarily supports text-based learning, leaving visual and kinesthetic learners at a disadvantage when attempting to learn more about the space.\n\nMy proposal aims to bridge this gap by developing visual and detailed posters that illustrate the complexities of the Decentraland DAO in an engaging and visual manner.\n\nWhy This Project Should Receive Funding:\n\n**Enhancing Accessibility**: Visual documentation will make the Decentraland DAO more accessible to a wider audience, including those who prefer visual learning as opposed to detailed, text-based learning. This increased accessibility may lead to greater community engagement and participation in the long term.\n\n**Improving Understanding**: By transforming complex text into clear visual representations, the posters can foster a better understanding of how the Decentraland DAO functions, and may inadvertently lead to better decision-making from the DAO in the long-term. This may lead to the empowerment of users, who can be comfortable interacting with the platform with greater confidence.\n\n**Supporting Educational Initiatives**: These visual aids could become essential educational tools for newcomers, developers, and educators alike, supporting a variety of learning preferences and needs.\n\n**Brand-Themed Content**: This visual content is also useful material for our social media channels to explain and promote our current structures, which will be useful content for several different platforms.\n\nProblems That This Project Will Solve\n\n**Complexity Barrier**: The inadvertent complexity of Decentraland's DAO can be intimidating to new users. Visual aids can actively break down these barriers and make DCL-focused information far more digestible to the average DCL user.\n\n**Lack of Diverse Learning Resources**: Currently, DCL's documentation is tailored mainly for those who learn best through reading. By incorporating visual learning, this project will satisfy the needs of diverse learning styles.\n\nBenefits to the Decentraland Platform\n\n**Increased Community Engagement**: More comprehensible and appealing resources may attract more users to engage with the platform, growing the Decentraland community.\n\n**Strengthened Governance**: By improving understanding and accessibility, more community members may feel empowered to participate in governance, thereby enriching the democratic process within the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n**Boosting Educational Outreach**: These visual resources can be leveraged for workshops, tutorials, and other educational initiatives set up by both the DAO and the Foundation; strengthening Decentraland's position as a leader in virtual world technology.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis project is not just about adding new content; it is about making Decentraland more inclusive, accessible, and understandable. By funding this project, we can take a significant step towards building Decentraland-focused documentation that resonates with all types of learners, reinforcing its place as a pioneering platform in the virtual world industry.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nI foresee this process taking a maximum of **three months**, which includes the ideation phase, designing phase, and ultimately, the delivery phase of the project (with room for organized, constructive feedback).\n\nThe first month of the project will be very ideation heavy, where I will commit to collecting as much information and feedback as possible from the community, including feedback related to the chosen brand style, coloring and organization of information/deliverables.\n\nOne key part of my work will be related to summarising and prioritizing different parts of our docs portal, specifically organizing documentation related to the DAO Overview, the DAO Grants Information, and the DAO User Guide. Once this information has been summarised and prioritized, I will then shift my focus on identifying key **illustrations** I can work on that will aid in better visualizing Decentraland's systems and the high-level organization of the DAO. These illustrations will be an important addition to the posters; providing the community with illustrations of our systems.\n\nThe second month of the project will focus on design work, which will feed into half of the third month of the project. I will aim to prioritize communicating back to the community at all times, to ensure I can improve on feedback.\n\nBy the end of the third month, we should have these static posters & illustrations done, with the aim of having content we can further build on in the future.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should the Community Be the Final Arbiter in Grants Revocation Decisions ?",
    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (StrategicUnit)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should the Community Be the Final Arbiter in Grants Revocation Decisions ?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=78bacea0-2fa2-11ee-a512-65477fceb1b0)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to determine whether the Decentraland Community should have the final say in the revocation of Grants through the DAO governance process, thereby aligning the decision-making process with the principle of decentralization.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal emphasizes the existing procedure where the Grant Support Squad and Revocations Committee can initiate a preventive pause or revocation of the Grant Vesting Contract when potential concerns are raised. However, this proposal suggests an enhancement to this process: the final decision on the revocation of the Grant Vesting Contract would be subject to the outcome of a Community vote. If the Community vote is in favor of the Grantee and against the revocation, the Grant Vesting Contract won't be revoked. In such a case, any preventive pause that had been initiated would be lifted and the Grant Vesting Contract along with its payments would be continued, and vice versa.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Decentraland DAO is the decision-making tool for MANA, NAMES and LAND holders in Decentraland’s virtual world. The DAO’s Grants Program is one of the best vehicles to help grow the Decentraland ecosystem and must be aligned with the main spirit of\nDecentraland - Decentralization. Currently, the revocation of Grants is done by the Revocations Committee, which may not fully reflect the Community's will. This proposal suggests that while the Revocations Committee should continue to exist and make the initial decision on whether a grant should be revoked, the final decision should rest with the Community, providing a safeguard mechanism to override the Committee's decision if necessary. Grants revocation decisions should not be delegated to a small group of individuals, instead, they should be resolved through the DAO's governance process, which was designed as a legitimate tool to mirror the Community's sentiments.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nFor a detailed overview of the proposed amendments, please refer to the **[Complete Specification.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ak0TE7kigK50JhM1NNO0XPdCe7wj8hp4vm90ksQXpdk/)**\n\nThese amendments are intended for integration into the **[current Revocations Committee Framework.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VPb33QdeFlg-qnmclWZF2Ll\\_3USLUnFO/)**\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy allowing the Community to override the decisions of the Revocations Committee through the DAO governance process, we can ensure that the Grants Program remains a true reflection of the Community's desires and needs. The Revocations Committee will still play a crucial role in evaluating cases and making initial decisions, but also that the Community has a say. It strikes a balance between the need for specialized decision-making and the principle of decentralization.This proposal seeks to enhance the grant revocation process by aligning it with governance process and equip the Community with a clear protocol for handling relevant cases, thereby making procedure simpler and optimizing time.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The total amount of MANA requested in this grant will be fully allocated as rewards for the top 20 performing scenes over the next 3 months. Subsequently, the intention is to transfer ownership of the program to the community itself.\n\nBy implementing this approach, we aim to encourage scene creators to continuously enhance their work.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n90,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x8F55aFE45C1058a6cD353F4dC80A7dC41435C909\n\n## Email address\n\npamela.corvino@decentraland.org\n\n## Description\n\nThe Decentraland platform emphasizes user-generated content, including wearables and scenes. This high-quality content not only attracts and retains users but also stimulates the marketplace, ultimately increasing revenue for the DAO. Therefore, it is crucial for the DAO to incentivize the creation of exceptional content to maintain this positive cycle.\n\nCurrently, the DAO operates a grant program to stimulate the development of in-world experiences. However, beyond this initial support, there are no direct incentives for creators to continue enhancing their scenes. To address this, we propose a Rewards Program for content creators with a focus on Web3 Users (those logged in with their own crypto wallet) and Engagement. This program aims to encourage existing creators and attract new ones, pushing the quality of content and emphasizing user retention.\n\nWe will utilize metrics such as Web3 Unique visitors, visits, retention rate, time spent, and returning visits to build a comprehensive ranking system.\n\nHow will we build it?\n\nThe process involves creating five different scene rankings, each corresponding to a key metric. These rankings are then combined using **[Borda’s count method](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/waymakermath4libarts/chapter/borda-count/)**, with the formula:\n\n*scene_score = value(position_ranking\\_1) + … + value(position_ranking\\_5)*\n\nThe value of each position in the rankings is calculated using numbers derived from different percentiles of a normal distribution. This method ensures that ranking in the top positions is more rewarding.\n\nPoints to be considered:\n\n*   Only Web3 users (users owning a wallet) will be eligible.\n*   A scene refers to the Base Tile ID. Moving your scene elsewhere will count as a different (new) scene.\n*   All scenes in Genesis City can participate in the contest, excluding plazas and roads.\n*   For now, Worlds are not included.\n*   If the same “group” has more than one scene in the ranking, they will be rewarded for the one with the best position, and the other one/s will be neutralized, making way for the next one in the rank.\n*   We will publish the rankings for the Top 50 Scenes.\n*   Timeframe: All the information used in the program will be based  on \"Current month\" timeframe. We will only retain historical data for the current month & the last one in storage, ensuring transparency and efficiency.\n*   Transparency and Data: All the information utilized in the Rewards Program is already public and available in our catalysts. To facilitate analytics, we are sharing pre-processed data, intermediate tables and the ranking code repository.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWeek 1 and 2\n\n*   Create all the Data sets & intermediate Tables needed for the analysis\n*   Create an open repository for the code behind the Ranking Logic.\n*   Create a Data Studio for daily visualization of partial results & Final ones.\n*   Create a special view in Data Studio for suspicious activity flagged per scene.\n    Week 3\n*   Validation of partial results\n*   Special attention to Fraud Detection\n\nSeptember 1st\n\n*   Have a Q\\&A Open space with the community\n*   Publish Final Results\n*   Payment procedure\n\nOctober 2nd\n\n*   Have a Q\\&A Open space with the community\n*   Publish Final Results\n*   Payment procedure\n\nNovember 1st\n\n*   Have a Q\\&A Open space with the community\n*   Publish Final Results\n*   Payment procedure\n\nFraud Prevention Measures:\nTo ensure the integrity of the Rewards Program, we have implemented the following constraints to prevent fraud:\n\n1.  Scene Visits: Only stays lasting more than 5 seconds within a scene will be considered for the program. Visits lasting 5 seconds or less will be excluded from consideration. Additionally, sessions longer than 45 minutes will be valid, but the count will be capped at 45 minutes to avoid excessive influence on rankings.\n2.  Bot Detection: Users creating more than 4 wallets from the same IP address or User Agent within a day will be flagged as potentially fraudulent and tagged as bots. These flagged wallets will be removed from the program.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This will apply to every proposal with predefined voting options (Yes/No/Abstain), mitigating the potential for undue centralization and single-handedly approvals.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThere are multiple positions in the ecosystem discussing the problems of token-weighted voting mechanisms for decentralized organizations (See [Vitalik, 2021](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) and [Chapman, 2021](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman/status/1465404853023346693)) but the reality is that most of the bigger DAOs out there used this approach from the early days and continue to do so. That’s partially because changing core-governance design is a haunting and risky task that demands a lot of engagement and politics between the community and major stakeholders of the project.\n\nIn Decentraland, specifically, the initial governance design of *1 token - 1 vote* for our utility token (MANA) and *1 token - N votes* for NFT assets made sense in the beginning. However, in the light of history, we are seeing how early decisions regarding other aspects of the protocol (such as initial LAND distribution, and the formation of Districts, among others) are negatively impacting the DAO’s ability to make decisions in a more democratic and representative way. As we recognize the challenges of modifying the fundamental token-weighted voting mechanism we would like to propose improvements to the current system to move it closer to an ideal state.\n\nSome of the collected evidence for this proposal and the adopted approach comes from the findings and insights of the paper authored by Mitchell Goldberg and Fabian Schär *\"Metaverse Governance: An Empirical Analysis of Voting Within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, 2023”.*\n\nAs stated by the cited authors, there are vast differences in VP and its distribution *“Some addresses control large amounts of governance tokens, others extensive LAND estates, or large collections of names. VP may also be a result of delegation by other entities. In any case, these high VP voters have a significant say in the outcome of a proposal.” (Goldberg, M. et al. p13)*\n\n![Untitled](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/1278/Kb6Wx9.png)\n\nVP Distribution\n\nCurrently, there are approximately 5,000 historically active members of Decentraland DAO. However, as evident in the chart below, of the 99.7M total active VP, near 50% of VP is controlled by only 19 wallets.\n\n![Untitled](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/2194/DEJgF3.png)\n\nOne of the most significant issues appears when voting outcomes suddenly flip, especially when this occurs very close to the end of the voting process. The authors gathered evidence regarding this issue and pointed out that they found *“evidence for proposal outcomes that were changed close to the conclusion of the proposals voting periods. Sometimes the outcome was changed by a single ‘last minute’ voter with a very high VP” (Goldberg, M. et al. 15).*\n\n![Untitled](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/1024x768q70/924/3uLPnc.png)\n\nAnother major concern revolves around funds appropriation through grant proposals, particularly when high-voting power individuals are involved: *“Approx. 45% of grants have effectively been approved by a single entity that may or may not be the person who proposed the grant. While lobbying and trying to extract rent through grants and tenders is a concept well-known in traditional governance systems, a pseudonymous setup could worsen this problem.” (Goldberg, M. et al. 20)*\n\n\n## Specification\n\nImplement a limit for the maximum VP accounted from a single address to 50% of the threshold for each proposal type:\n\n*   POI, Catalysts, Names Bans - 50% Limit\n*   Draft Proposals - 50% Limit\n*   Linked Wearables - 50% Limit\n*   Grants - 50% Limit\n*   Governance - 50 % Limit\n*   Hiring - 50 % Limit\n*   Pitch, Tender, Bid Proposals - 50% Limit\n\nExamples:\n\n*   POI, Catalysts, Names Bans \\[500k VP threshold] => 250k VP Limit\n*   Draft Proposals \\[1M VP threshold] => 500k VP Limit.\n*   Linked Wearables \\[4M VP threshold] => 2M VP\n*   20k Grant \\[2M VP threshold] => 1M VP Limit\n*   80k Grant \\[4.4M VP threshold] =>2.2M VP Limit\n*   Governance \\[6M threshold] => 3M VP Limit\n*   Hiring \\[6M threshold] => 3M VP Limit\n*   Pitch Proposal \\[2M VP threshold] => 1M VP Limit\n*   Tender Proposal \\[4M VP threshold] => 2M VP\n\nThis measure aims to ensure that no individual or entity can exert disproportionate influence, preventing dominance and reinforcing the DAO's commitment to decentralized and democratic governance, as an alternative to traditional shareholder corporations.  Moreover, this limitation encourages a robust decision-making structure, valuing major stakeholders input by allowing them the freedom to exercise their voting power. Simultaneously, it mitigates the sense of undue influence, as their vote won't unilaterally alter the outcome of a proposal due to the 50% cap, ensuring the DAO's collective autonomy.\n\nIt is important to be noted that the proposed cap percentages on voting power (VP) from single wallets, set at 50% of the voting threshold, will remain a fixed parameter even in the event of potential adjustments to VP thresholds in the future. While the specific VP thresholds for various proposal types may evolve as the DAO's landscape shifts, the principle of limiting individual voting power to 50% remains unwavering.\n\nAcknowledge that the proposed VP limit scheme will not be failproof until we have a sybil attack defense mechanism, but its effectiveness is enhanced by the operational costs associated with splitting assets for MANA and LAND holders. Moreover, it remains infeasible for ESTATE and Delegated VP holders, further reducing the risk.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhale voting has been a subject of ongoing discussion within the DAO community, both in private channels and public forums. This situation has made clear that there’s an expressing need to address the concerns related to the disproportionate influence of large holders that can lead to centralization and unequal decision-making power within the DAO.\n\nThe proposed approach seeks to implement changes in a manner that allows the DAO to experiment and adapt gradually, considering the importance of the VP distribution strategy as a foundational aspect of the DAO's governance model. This approach is the first, and one of potentially multiple ways to address this specific issue with an eye towards adapting our current system without starting from the ground up.\n\nThis governance proposal not only marks an essential step towards addressing the issue of whale voting and VP distribution but it is also a strong statement from the DAO and its expectations in the long term. Setting VP limits, aims to promote a more equitable and balanced decision-making process. Additionally, the proposed rollout strategy allows the DAO to assess the impact of these limits on grant and governance proposals, learn from the results, and make informed adjustments to the limits over time.\n\n*Bibliography*\n\nGoldberg, M; Schär, F (2023): Metaverse Governance: An Empirical Analysis of Voting Within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, 2023\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4310845\n\nButerin, V (2021): Moving beyond coin voting governance\nhttps://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html\n\nTransparency Dashboard: https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/fca13118-c18d-4e68-9582-ad46d2dd5ce9/page/p_nlc90z86rc\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xbc02db030361121dd43bbb2fcbcb4f9f98c1dc7d (DAO2)\n\nI have been playing around with the ENS APP (https://app.ens.domains/) and with their latest update the app shows various information on Decentraland names. By using the app's set resolver function it has become extremely simple & easy to set any Decentraland name as the primary name. What this means is Decentraland names can be used to send & receive cryptocurrency/nft's to all wallets & all networks. For test purposes I have successfully set one of my name, Burrito.dcl.eth as the primary name. I have also sent eth to this name which was successfully delivered & can be seen on etherscan. PFP image upload function also worked.\n\nThere are many advantages for using Decentraland names as a human readable cryptocurrency wallet addresses.\n\n*   No yearly renewal fees\n\n*   2,3,4 or 5+ Letter or Digit are all capped at 100 Mana initial mint price\n\n*   In-game Avatar Names\n\n*   In-game link/location URL's\n\n*   100MB Free Worlds Space\n\nThis unique aspect of promoting/marketing dcl names as human readable crypto wallet addresses could help assist many existing & new users in web3 & other metaverse's to step into Decentraland eco system for the first time. Resulting in mass adoption from wider communities.\n\nCurrently 3 letter/digit ens names cost $640 per year, 4 letter/digit ens names cost $160 per year.

The MANA in this contract vests every second, thus gradually increasing the size of the DAO’s fund at a rate of 1.8M MANA per month. Also, the DAO has its revenue streams, such as marketplace fees and wearable curation fees.\n\nDuring the Q4 of 2022, the DAO decides through the [governance](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bfab7b70-7b75-11ed-ad27-015f26e7c35c) process to define a strategy to limit the maximum amount of funds that can be allocated quarterly via the Grants Program.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAfter an [analysis from the Grant Support Squad on Q2 funded grants](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ld8GVZSVzqWBseNzJD82RCivXGgkZ9iwojKW6aBQ0bA/edit#gid=1232989707), [an open session with the community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fds9-b9geLY), and hearing thoughts on the previous [pre-poll governance](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7872fd40-2bde-11ee-8fbb-d9eddf5c2b3f), we have understood the following insights, aligned with the proposed [new categorizations of grants](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c4c43270-362b-11ee-be2d-676a2489bc16):\n\n*   **In World content (In world Building)=** As this category was used fully and grants under this category have passed but due to lack of funding they were not granted, we propose to increase this category from 20% to 35%.\n*   **Platform =** As in Q2 this category was used by 19.83%, we are proposing to decrease this category from 40% to 20.\n*   **Core Unit 15% =** Left as it was as it was enough to cover its needs and fund new proposals under the category.\n    Sponsorship = as in Q2 the usage of this category was 0%, we are decreasing this category from 10 to 2 %.\n*   **Documentation =** As in Q2 the usage of this category was 0% as the only grant that passed was nos compliant with the grantees proposal for this category, we are adding a new category that can cover our community’s needs (Community Experiences) and we are decreasing from 3% to 1% (which for Q3 would have represented $14630 DAI)\n*   **Social Media Content =** In Q2, the usage of this category was 0%. We are decreasing this category from 5% to 2%. We are aware that the total 5% of the budget for this category was used, but we’d like to encourage the social media content creators to be able to bring their communities to experiences in the Reference Client, and they would be covered in the Community Experiences category.\n*   **Accelerator =** From 7 to 10% because it was a short budget for the requested grants in Q2.\n*   **Community Experience (new category) =** assigning 15% (this category aims to bring people together in the reference client to generate community engagement. This can include creating wearables and emotes, or organizing events to gather with others and ignite fun community interactions. Please check out the governance proposal named [“DAO GRANTS PROGRAM - NEW CATEGORY: COMMUNITY EXPERIENCES” for more information.](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c4c43270-362b-11ee-be2d-676a2489bc16)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Grants Program is divided into four periods (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4). At the beginning of each quarter the maximum amount of money that can be allocated through the Grants Program will be defined using the formula: 5,500,000 \\* MANA_PRICE \\* 0.7\n\nBelow is the proposed distribution for the next quarter (Q4, 2023) aligned with the proposed new categorizations of grants, including the quarter budgets using the previous example of a MANA price of $0.38:\n\n*   In World Building 35% = $512,050 USD\n*   Community Experiences 15% = 219,450 USD\n*   Platform 20% = $ 292,600 USD\n*   Core Unit 15% = $ 219,450 USD\n*   Sponsorship 2% = $ 29,260 USD\n*   Documentation 1% = $ 14,630 USD\n*   Social Media Content 2% = $ 29,260 USD\n*   Accelerator 10% = $ 146,300 USD\n\n![foto](https://i.ibb.co/ZLmtJ82/Screenshot-2023-08-08-at-17-14-50.png)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe DAO has an income of 1.8M MANA every month and should set up a limit control to spend at most 70% of such a stream. This will mitigate the risk of running out of funds in the next 7 years.\nThe DAO should agree on limits for each category to distribute the funds based on a targeted strategy. This will encourage initiatives in underfunded categories.\nThis approach aims to foster growth and development within the Decentraland ecosystem while ensuring fair allocation across different categories of projects, increasing those which aim to build architecture to populate Land **In world building** (current In-world content) and bring people together in the reference client to generate community engagement **Community experiences** (In poll named Community Builders).\n\nAlso, The DAO can change this distribution in the future via a Governance Proposal.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This includes the proper definition of the categories to avoid overlapping in objectives, and changes in the percentages of allocation of budget in current categories.\n\nWe have decided to pursue both in different draft governance proposals. This one will address the details of the Community Experiences category, including its requirements, impact metrics and the delimitations of scope of existing categories. Another draft governance proposal with the name “DAO GRANTS PROGRAM - BUDGETARY REDISTRIBUTION” will address the percentages of allocation of budget.\n\nFrom the Categories definition and scope, we suggest to make the following specifications:\n\n**In world building** (current In-world content): Aims to build architecture to populate Land. The experiences can be scenes and games for Decentraland users through the reference client.\n\n**Community experiences** (this proposal): Aims to bring people together in the reference client and generate community engagement. This can include creating wearables and emotes, or  organizing events to gather with others and ignite fun community interactions.\n\n**Social Media** (currently has the same name): Aims to generate social media content to bring new audiences to Decentraland.\n\nThe other categories (Documentation, Platform, Core Units, Sponsorship and Accelerator) will remain the same.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs stated in the poll, During Q2 which finished in June 2023, [we detected grant proposals that could fit into two or more categories](https://medium.com/decentrland-dao/dao-grants-program-quarterly-insights-308913de2a29), and that there are great projects that are not addressed by our program.\nOne example is the type of grant that aims to onboard new members to Decentraland for specific target audiences, like [DCL Brazil](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a7833c20-e2bf-11ed-ae6b-bdc7e2b26a35). In this case, the grantee requested a Documentation Grant, which was not compliant with the Category, but the proposal was valuable for community building and onboarding new members.\nThere are also valuable DAO members that make community-building experiences and events, like [ABC Decentraland](https://twitter.com/ABCDecentraland), or [CBD - Community Building Decentraland](https://twitter.com/CBDecentraland) who share knowledge with newcomers and ignite interaction among Decentraland users and DAO members.\nOn the other hand, in the near past, the community has voted YES for the [Ambassadors Program](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=52de99e0-f27c-11ed-9bc2-e5fe350d0c93), and one of the principal objectives was to empower community members. We strongly agree with the spirit of the proposal, and think it would be a good investment to support these valuable community stewards that make the experience in Decentraland more exciting and fun.\nWith these inputs, we hosted an open session with the community to discuss the creation of a new category in the Grants program, named Community Experiences, and we created a poll. We also consulted with several stakeholders, grantees and advisors to gather valuable insights in building this proposal.\n\nConcerns so far that have been taken into account:\n\n*   The community has expressed the concerns of not closing the possibility of newcomers to be able to submit proposals, so we have deleted the requirement posted in the poll regarding the “Demonstrated commitment to community building within Decentraland: Proven track record of organizing and facilitating community events, initiatives, or educational programs” as we agree that we don’t want to close the possibility of new creators to join us in building a metaverse owned and created by its users. We want to be  open, welcoming and friendly to our fellow creators who want to join us in this quest. We have added track record as something that is valuable in the brief description, and not as a requirement.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Name of new category**: Community Experiences\n\n**Brief description**: Aims to bring people together in the reference client to generate community engagement. This can include creating wearables and emotes, or organizing events to gather with others and ignite fun community interactions.  A proven track record of organizing and facilitating community events, initiatives, or educational programs is highly valuable.\n\n**Category Requirements**:\n\n*   Define how your project will contribute to community building in the Decentraland Ecosystem.\n*   Development of attractive experiences in Decentraland that generate retention of users in the form of events, exchanges of wearables, emotes or other interactions consumed by players through the reference client.\n*   The proposal should include how you will collaborate with other community builders, Core Units, or projects to foster cross-community partnerships.\n*   The proposal should include the development of resources, tutorials, or guides that help explore the referent client or onboarding new community members for these experiences.\n\n**Impact metrics**:\n\n*   Number of community members engaged or impacted through Community Experiences initiatives. This can be measured by event attendees, wearables minted, or other pertinent metrics based on the specific proposal.\n*   Feedback and testimonials from community members regarding the value and impact of the proposal’s contributions. This can be shown in the monthly updates of the grant as quotes from users who come to the community building experiences or other stakeholders.\n*   Growth and activity metrics of the community platforms, scenes in the reference client, forums, or social media groups facilitated by these Community Builders.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe implementation of the Community Experiences category would help the Decentraland Grants Program by covering the needs of the Decentraland members who make an outstanding work building community, and generating fun experiences in our Reference Client, igniting valuable engagement.\n\nIn the past, this type of creators haven’t been able to successfully apply to grants under the current categories as their activities and impact metrics would fall under two or more categories, or were not covered by our current categories.\n\nIt would also help us better define the categories objectives, like Social Media (which would aim to to bring people from other communities to Decentraland) and In-world Content (which would aim to build architecture to populate land with games and builds) and add this Community Experiences category (which would aim to generate engagement), allowing each of these categories to cover specific needs.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Implementing Tenure Restrictions for DAO Committee Members",
    "body": "> by 0xb5f4ebcc5a90e58d953ee9e64e365c2468f31f51 (GoldGuy)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Implementing Tenure Restrictions for DAO Committee Members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=04fa4800-30b1-11ee-9309-9f2674902254)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to implement a 3-year term limit for DAO committee members in Decentraland, complemented by a 4-month transition period to vet and train incoming successors.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nAt present, there are no restrictions on the tenure of a DAO committee member in Decentraland, which may result in stagnation, lack of innovation, and potential abuse of power by those in these positions. This proposal aims to establish a fixed term length, thereby cultivating more diverse thinking and stimulating the regular introduction of fresh insights and enthusiasm. The expected result is a governance structure that is both more agile and aligned, reflecting the changing wants and needs of the Decentraland community.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn the existing governance structure of Decentraland, there is no limitation on the tenure of DAO committee members. This absence of term constraints can lead to several challenges that may hinder the optimal functioning and growth of the community:\n\nStagnation of Ideas: Without regular turnover, there may be a tendency toward complacency and a lack of fresh perspectives. This could result in stagnation and a reduced ability to adapt to new challenges and opportunities within the rapidly evolving landscape of our community.\n\nPotential Concentration of Power: Unlimited tenure might lead to an undue concentration of power within a small group of individuals. Such concentration could decrease transparency and inclusivity, risking the erosion of the decentralized principles that underpin Decentraland.\n\nBarrier to Participation: The absence of term limits may discourage new members from participating in governance. Knowing that positions might be perpetually occupied by incumbents can deter potential new contributors who might otherwise bring innovative ideas and diverse viewpoints.\n\nAlignment with Decentralized Principles: Decentraland's core philosophy emphasizes decentralization, diversity, and community-driven governance. Implementing term limits aligns with these principles by ensuring that a broader array of voices can participate in shaping the community's direction.\n\nBy setting a time limit for serving as a DAO committee member, this proposal seeks to invigorate the governance process with new insights, maintain alignment with decentralized values, and foster an environment that is both inclusive and adaptive to the changing needs of the Decentraland community.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTerm Limit: Each DAO committee member will be restricted to serving a maximum term of 3 years. This limitation is designed to ensure a regular influx of new ideas and perspectives within the committee.\n\nTransition Period: A structured 4-month transition period will be implemented at the end of each term. During this time, the trusted, qualified, and vetted individuals will be trained to assume the responsibilities of the outgoing members.\n\nSelection of Successors: Criteria for selecting the successors will be established, prioritizing individuals who demonstrate alignment with Decentraland's core values, possess relevant experience, and are committed to upholding the integrity of the governance process.\n\nEvolution of the Committee: By incorporating these measures, the DAO committee will be positioned to evolve naturally and responsively. This evolution is recognized as essential to maintaining the vitality and effectiveness of Decentraland's governance structure.\n\nThe proposed policy balances the need for continuity and experienced leadership with the imperative for innovation, inclusivity, and adaptability. It represents a thoughtful approach to sustaining the DAO committee's ability to serve the Decentraland community's present and future interests.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe absence of term limits for DAO committee members in Decentraland presents challenges such as the stagnation of ideas, potential concentration of power, barriers to participation, and misalignment with decentralized principles. These issues call for a thoughtful and structured approach to governance that allows for regular infusion of fresh perspectives.\n\nThe proposed solution of implementing a 3-year term limit, coupled with a 4-month transition period for training trusted, qualified, and vetted successors, addresses these challenges head-on. By doing so, it aims to create a dynamic, responsive, and inclusive governance structure that reflects the evolving needs and desires of the community.\n\nThe intended impact of this proposal is to foster an environment in which the DAO committee can evolve naturally, maintaining its vitality and effectiveness. It ensures that the core values of decentralization, diversity, and community-driven governance remain at the forefront of Decentraland's development.\n\nBy embracing this change, Decentraland can continue to thrive as a leading metaverse, guided by a governance structure that is both adaptive and true to its foundational principles.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x51159c749702295e745319935e4eddde238f3a7f\n\nShould the following $108,000 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe are excited to present an AI-based solution to an unsolved metaverse problem and lowers barriers to onboard NFT collectors to decentraland:\n\n**Problem:**\\\nThousands of NFT collectors want to use the PFP NFTs in their wallets as avatars across platforms.  Especially in 3D metaverse environments, this is difficult to pull off: The costs of rigging and format conversions of 2D PFPs to 3D Avatars are high.\n\n**Solution:**\\\nBeamit.space combines several cutting edge AI models to transform 2D PFPs into 3D Metaverse Avatars for Decentraland. Any PFP you want - you can soon use it in the metaverse.  And this can be done by anyone:\n\n1000x faster than ever before.\\\n100x cheaper than ever possible.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n108,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n8 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x51159c749702295E745319935E4EdddE238F3A7F\n\n## Email address\n\ndecentraland@beamit.space\n\n## Description\n\nWe believe Beamit.space is a game changer in 3D Avatar generation and will change the game for Metaverse onboarding. Our early prototype proves that we can make this a reality within 8 months.\n\n**The app solves this in 3 stages:**\n\nBeamit.space is using cutting edge technology. We are merging AI with 3D rendering and web3 technology in a unique way.\n\n**1. Generative AI**\n\nOur Generative AI (gAI) module enables users to complete PFPs to create a full body image. Our prototype (using Dall-E) shows, that decent results are achievable without even explicitly training the model. So we anticipate substantial improvement potential from training our own model (we are currently favoring training the open source model Stable Diffusion). The goal is to generate a highly accurate 360° full body image of the PFP (frontside and backside, eventually also side views).\n\n![current gAI prototype status](https://postimg.cc/D8GrP8SG)\n\n**2. Depth Prediction model** We use a  cutting edge Depth Prediction model to transform the frontside and backside 2D full body images into 3D models. Even though the model was trained on photography, the results for illustrations and even pixels design are stunning. We anticipate to be drastically improving the prototype results by training the model on appropriate datasets.\n\n![current zoeAI prototype status](https://postimg.cc/dL91FYXX)\n\n**3. Blender Cloud (a. Background removal, b. Merge & c. Rigging)**\n\nThe third step serves to set to finetune the raw renderings, merge them to a full 3D Avatar and rig them with the Decentraland skeleton rig. For this step we are using the open source 3D creation suite Blender.\n\na. Python scripts first will detect and **remove the background** from both the frontside and backside gAI results.\n![blender background removal](https://postimg.cc/9wdGVk5p)\n\nb. Next the **backside and frontside view 3D models are combined** to create the initial stage of the full avatar 3D model.\n\nc. The **automated rigging** is the most challenging part of the project. We are working on our own AI model based on existing 3D Shape Recognition models, as well as prediction models on how to position the skeleton in the avatar mesh. However, as perfect results are not to be expected in the ealry stage of this project, we will provide a blender cloud browser-application the user can use to adjust the rigging manually, to get a functioning avatar ready for publishing/submission.\n\n![Avatar rigging automation in Blender](https://postimg.cc/mt6Q4CKK)\n\n**Results:** All of the blender add-on scripts as well as the custom trained AI models will be open sourced.\n\nYou can now **check our prototype** (with Steps 1. and 2. in place) and **test it with your NFTs** - please request via  website form [beamit.space](https://beamit.space/).\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe anticipate the project to be ready within 8 months from now - with the result of an open sourced alpha release as result. We are working according to this roadmap, and will update here as well as in detail on our medium:\n\n**8 - 2023 Proof of Concept 3D frontside body, Ethereum**\\\nStatus of the project to date.\n\n**9 - 2023 Frond side + added backside Render generative AI model (gAI )**\n\n*   gAI model producing Both front & back side results.\n*   blender cloud set up and script testing.\n*   Project presentation & start of social media activities.\n\n**10 – 2023 Full Body 3D Render AI model (zoeAI)**\n\n*   custom 3D rendering model based on ZoeDepth  depth prediction model (for front and back).\n*   Community building activities.\n*   Unisat Wallet Ordinals integration\n\n**11 – 2023 Refined gAI model**\n\n*   Refined custom gAI model to achieve optimized results by training the model on web3 PFP data.\n\n**12 – 2023 – Blender Cloud: remove background**\n\n*   Remove the backgrounds of all 3D body perspectives via python script.\n\n**01 - 2023 – Blender Cloud full body merge**\n\n*   Creating full body 3D Avatar.\n\n**02 – 2024 refined zoeAI + rAI model**\n\n*   Trained models to further increase render quality\n*   Community building: private Alpha whitelist.\n\n**03 - 2024 – Blender Cloud: Rigging**\n\n*   Rigging the 3D Avatar in the cloud, with basic script support.\n*   Community building\n*   private Alpha\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

It is a highly adaptable game suitable for any scene. Originally designed for fun rather than play-to-earn.\n\nThis proposal offers to rewrite/migrate it to SDK7 as an openSource product and add some services for the community like tournaments and league management tools, allowing communities to apply play2Earn mechanics if they wish, everything Open-Source.\n\nBeing Open-Source will also allow you to fork the game, extend it or create your own mini-games, customize graphics, adapt OR resell it for brands, etc.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n48,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n4 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x42a8aB1CaE6f4A2DF5EcbAE904C37b0603c267b1\n\n## Email address\n\nsammich-game@proton.me\n\n## Description\n\nThe development of this proposal will bring numerous benefits to the Decentraland community. Being open source, it can be modified and customized for various communities. It can be adapted and resold for brands, or even used as an educational tool and guidebook.\n\nThis proposal stands out as one of the few, if not the only one, that initially prioritizes FUN over play-to-earn mechanics (or pay-to-maybe-play-to-maybe-earn mechanics ;P). Thus, the game has a strong foundation, and with these enhancements, communities will be empowered to implement their own play-to-earn mechanics, attracting more users while ensuring an enjoyable experience.\n\nThe game is compatible with any scene, requiring only a flat space that can be scaled or rotated. It supports multiplayer functionality and performs well even on the first old version of Decentraland. This efficiency and flexibility were integral to its design.\n\nConcerning distribution, the game will be provided both as a standalone scene for deployment and as a Decentraland library for easy integration into scenes. Furthermore, integration with Metazone will be reviewed and fixed if feasible. We also intend to propose integration into the Meta-Residence tower.\n\nIn addition to the game itself, a backoffice tool will be included, along with a web app that allows users to create custom tournaments and events. All components, including the game server, backoffice, database, and web app, will be packaged within a docker container, ensuring straightforward setup.\n\nComprehensive documentation and community support will accompany all aspects of the project.\n\n(If the Decentraland Foundation permits, there is a potential to develop it as a portable experience in the future.)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nDuring month 1\n\n*   Playable and demoable version\n\nDuring month 2 & 3\n\n*   Community tools to create tournaments, engagement and allow customizable play2Earn mechanics\n*   Testing / bugfixing\n\nDuring month 4\n\n*   Streamers tournament (golfcraft streamer tournament was the event with most views on Twitch in the history of decentraland, we can repeat the idea)\n*   “Explore and play with friends” event where players have to play on different lands where the game is deployed and with different friends to have the maximum score to win NFTs.\n*   Support on integrating with other products like MetaResidence tower, etc.\n*   Review Metazone integration (if  possible)\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

However, it has come to our attention that some of the committee members have left Decentraland or have become inactive.\n\nTo ensure the continued success and relevance of the Wearable Curation Committee, I propose the following steps:\n\nRemoving Inactive Members:\nAs a community, we should appreciate and acknowledge the contributions of all members who have been part of the committee in the past. However, it is essential to maintain an active and vibrant committee to fulfill its responsibilities effectively. Therefore, we propose to remove inactive members from the committee.\n\nCall for New Members:\nWith the departure of inactive members, we will open seats for new passionate and enthusiastic individuals to join the Wearable Curation Committee. These new members should have a genuine interest in fostering creativity, promoting diversity, and ensuring high-quality wearables in Decentraland.\n\nRegular Evaluations:\nMoving forward, we should establish a regular evaluation process for committee members to ensure that all participants remain actively engaged in their duties. This evaluation will help us identify and address any potential future issues of inactivity.\n\nPlease share your thoughts and support!!\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xed7461fd98758a84b76d6e941cbb92891443c36f\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Permanently ban jar0d](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=35884b50-2db1-11ee-a512-65477fceb1b0)\n\n## Summary\n\nI propose that current Decentraland community member jar0d be permanently banned from ALL Decentraland DAO discord servers and DAO discussion forums and recommend to the DCL Foundation that they ban him as well from their discord and forums as well\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Decentraland DAO and Foundation Discord servers are a places where many community members gather in hopes of engaging in relevant and insightful conversations pertaining to the Decentraland.\n\nWhile disagreements often occur, for the most part the community is able to engage in these disagreements respectfully.\n\nHowever, community member jar0d has a very long history of being verbally combative and disrespectful toward nearly all other community members, and engages in this activity nearly every single day.\n\nIn fact, since the DAO instituted a mute mechanism, jar0d is one of the most muted member of the community.\n\nJar0d has repeatedly referred to community members by disrespectful an derogatory names that include but are not limited to:\n\nDumb Bitch\nBitch\nBigot\nTransphobe\nSack of Shit\nHuman Fleshlight\n\nJar0d's vulgar language inside Decentraland Discord server and discussions forums, often includes profanity angers and escalate tensions between himself and other community members.\n\nAs a result of Jar0ds disruptive conversations, on many occasions the entire DAO general channel has been put on a cooldown to slow communications. In effect, due to the actions of one instigator, the entire community is constantly being punished and therefore cannot effectively communicate.\n\nIn my opinion, having observed the discussions of jar0d over many months, and despite the innumerous warning he has received to cease (and many mutes), he has continued to irritate, antagonize, and intimidate good people to the point many no longer choose to participate in Decentraland discussions out of fear of being verbally attacked and abused by jar0d.\n\nWhile some have called for more forceful moderation, I believe that action is an unnecessary policing of the entire community to simply mitigate the unacceptable actions of one member.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs I mentioned, jar0d has a very long history of being disruptive. He has received many public warnings; many have attempted to converse with him about his unacceptable behaviors privately via DMS; he has been muted many times; nothing has seemed to have worked, as he continues to this day to use the Decentraland discords and discussion forums as his personal platforms to engage in harassing, abusive, disruptive, and often libelous behaviors.\n\nIf the community would like the Decentraland Discord channels and forums to once again be  platforms where they can freely express their ideas, views, and concerns without the fear being incessantly attacked, then there must be accountability. In my opinion, those whose seemingly sole purpose of existence is to intentionally disrupt, irritate and annoy, should be permanently removed from the community.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPermanently ban jar0d from all Decentraland DAO Discord servers and permanently ban jar0d from all DAO proposal discussion Forums.\n\nMake a recommendation to the DCL Foundation that they ban jar0d from all Decentraland Foundation Discord servers and discussion Forums, as well; including in-world chat and voice communication channels, and any and all other current or future communication channels not mentioned.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nDecentraland DAO Community member Jar0d is currently serving a 1 week mute in the DCL DAO Discord. The impact of this short duration mute  has been enormously beneficial. During this mute duration people have been freely able to engage in active productive conversations without the constant fear they previously encountered of being attacked, harassed, or interrupted by jar0d.\n\nHowever, during this time, jar0D has NOT been muted from the DAO proposal discussion Forums, where he continued to disrupt, irritate and annoy people.\n\nThis 1 week mute was very helpful in determining the impact of such a proposed ban.\n\nWhile banning members is not something that should be taken lightly, in some cases doing so for the benefit of the entire community is necessary; this unfortunately is one such case that is necessary.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nPermanently Ban user jar0d from viewing, or engaging with :\n\n1.  All Decentraland DAO Discord servers\n2.  All Decentraland DAO proposal discussion Forums.\n\nRecommendation to the DCL Foundation that they Permanently ban jar0d from viewing, or engaging with:\n\n1.  All Decentraland Foundation Discord servers\n2.  All Decentraland Foundation proposal discussion Forums.\n3.  Ban userJar0d from using Decentraland platform in-World discussion and voice communication.\n4.  Any and all other current or future communication channels not mentioned.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt is my hope that all of jar0d’s victims, both past and present, read this proposal and take the necessary action to permanently ban him.\n\nIn doing so, it is my hope that the Decentraland community can once again reclaim their right to engage with other members free from the fear of harassment. And approving this action will also serve as a deterrent and reminder to all others that the type of behavior that jar0d has for too long engaged in will no longer be tolerated within our community.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This proposal seeks to create a comprehensive document that will encompass various aspects of the DAO's activities.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs the Decentraland DAO continues to experience rapid growth and attract incremental participation from diverse community members and stakeholders, the need for a robust Code of Ethics becomes increasingly evident.\n\nA diverse community brings fresh perspectives and ideas, but it also poses challenges related to potential conflict escalation. Without a well-defined framework and clear guidelines for moderators to apply rules fairly and consistently, there is a risk of subjective decision-making and inconsistency in enforcing standards of conduct.\n\nBy establishing a comprehensive Code of Ethics, the DAO aims to create a better and more welcoming space for new joiners and a safer space for the current community members. This framework will promote transparency, fairness, and inclusivity, providing a solid foundation for all community members to participate and contribute with confidence.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Decentraland DAO's Code of Ethics will be founded on core principles, including fairness and inclusivity, privacy and data protection, open decision-making, and conflict resolution. These guiding values form the foundation for cultivating an ecosystem that is inclusive, secure, and accountable.\n\nThis document is structured into distinct sections to encompass a comprehensive framework that guides the behavior and interactions of all community members:\n\nI. **Preamble**: In this introductory section, the Code sets forth the fundamental values and overarching principles that underpin the DAO's ethical foundation.\n\nII. **Core Principles and Guidelines**: This section outlines the key principles that form the backbone of the Code of Ethics. These principles serve as guiding lights for all participants, fostering a culture of collaboration, openness, and responsible conduct.\n\nIII. **Enforcement Mechanisms**: The Code further defines specific rules and guidelines for community engagement and communication. It explicitly prohibits excessive attacks, insults, trolling, flaming, bullying, baiting for arguments, and the use of offensive language towards others. This section ensures a safe and respectful environment for all members to express their views and ideas freely.\n\nIV. **Rule Enforcement**: The final section addresses the enforcement mechanisms of the Code of Ethics. It outlines the procedures and consequences for non-compliance with the established ethical standards.\n\nV. **Closing**: final statement.\n\n[**CODE OF ETHICS DRAFT**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dIvHyEMddngMNKagw9qV0qdCqfHE8VEAvXPpOBpcvP8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n*In the event this proposal is approved, community feedback and insights will be collected to help shape the final document.*\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRecognizing the importance of actively involving all community members in the rule-making process and to ensure a truly inclusive and representative framework, rules and guidelines, the adoption of a well-structured Code of Ethics will strengthen community trust, enhance the overall experience for participants, and ensure the Decentraland DAO remains as a sustainable ecosystem for all its stakeholders.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": ": Decentraland Governance - Lowering Wearable Publishing Fee",
    "body": "> by 0xed0e0cb94f60f72ec94bef848f5df4cbd365af1d (InJesterr)\n\nThis proposal aims to address concerns related to the publishing fee for wearables in Decentraland and suggests a revised pricing structure to create a more accessible environment for creators. By lowering the fee to $100, and adjusting the curator and DAO payouts to $30 and $70, respectively, this proposal seeks to encourage more participation in the creation of wearables and further incentivize curators and the Decentraland DAO.\n\n**Proposal Details:**\n\n**Lowering the Wearable Publishing Fee:**\n\nThe wearable publishing fee will be reduced to $100 (equivalent in MANA) to lower the barrier for creators to mint and publish their wearables on the Decentraland platform.\nAdjusting Curator and DAO Payouts:\n\nThe curator payout for each wearable sale will be set at $30 (equivalent in MANA).\nThe remaining $70 (equivalent in MANA) from each wearable sale will be allocated to the Decentraland DAO.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n**Encouraging Creators:** By lowering the publishing fee, creators will find it more accessible to mint and introduce their wearables to the market, promoting a diverse and engaging content ecosystem within Decentraland.\n\n**Strengthening the Decentraland DAO:** Allocating $70 from each wearable sale to the Decentraland DAO will bolster the development and growth of the platform. The increased funds will enable the DAO to support community initiatives, projects, and platform improvements.\n\n**Improved User Engagement:** With a more affordable publishing fee, creators can experiment and release more wearables, attracting a broader audience of users interested in exploring and purchasing unique and desirable digital assets.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Create a Metaverse Gaming Center to teach builders how to develop games for DCL",
    "body": "> by 0xdef79f2b0e466260b1e87264d327d03de0eac50c (escreador)\n\nShould the following $32,400 grant in the Sponsorship category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe are developing a **Metaverse Gaming Center (MGC)**, a phygital space located in Bogotá, Colombia. The primary purpose of this Center is to **empower creators to interact, co-create, and learn about Decentraland game development**. Here is a floor plan of the MGC: https://bit.ly/43W1sYq\n\nWith the release of the SDK 7, the possibilities for game developers have been significantly increased. Our initiative aims to make Decentraland accessible to a new generation of talented creators interested in developing games for the platform while pushing our fashion initiative.\n\nBy offering this resource, we hope to inspire and educate our community, fostering a culture of innovation and creativity that will shape the future of Decentraland.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n32,400 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xdEF79f2b0e466260B1E87264d327d03De0EAc50c\n\n## Email address\n\nandres.fonseca@itrmachines.com\n\n## Description\n\nSince establishing Espacio Creador DAO (https://escreador.wtf/), we have collaborated with Latin American creators to democratize access to web3 and Decentraland. A year of co-creation with various artists from the region has highlighted **experiential learning as the most effective way to ensure accessibility**.\n\nOver the past year, we've successfully hosted phygital events and activities: https://bit.ly/43RjI5p,  Leveraging this experience, and after analyzing the needs of the platform, we propose the development of a Metaverse Gaming Center (MGC) in Bogotá, Colombia. The Center will serve as a hub for promoting Decentraland game related development. We recognize the symbiosis of gaming, fashion and technology as a driving force for adopting virtual worlds.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that a fully equipped MGC is resource-intensive, our extensive experience with phygital events and gaming equips us to develop the initial iteration of the MGC. This first phase will allow us to gauge engagement from Latin American creators and measure the retention of these creators in Decentraland. **Our primary goal is to educate future designers on developing Decentraland games and wearables**, while offering an engaging phygital space for newcomers to explore and learn about Decentraland.\n\nThe MGC project promises to be a dynamic space for individuals to learn about, interact with, and contribute to Decentraland. By bridging the physical and virtual worlds, the MGC will champion user adoption, content creation, and community development in the region.\n\nKey features of the MGC will include:\n\n*   **Educational Workshops:** Regular workshops introducing users to Decentraland, and its suite of tools and resources for crafting unique content and experiences.\n\n*   **Interactive Exhibits:** An immersive showcase of the latest developments, art, and applications within the Decentraland ecosystem, facilitated by DCL VR. https://sidequestvr.com/app/11626.\n\n*   **Creation Spaces:** Dedicated areas for creators and developers to collaborate, innovate, and generate games for Decentraland, equipped with essential tools, software, and hardware.\n\n*   **Networking and Events:** Regular meetups, hackathons, and other community events to stimulate networking and collaboration among Decentraland users, creators, and enthusiasts.\n\nWe are excited to forge partnerships with local institutions like Universidad Nacional de Colombia and Uniminuto, as well as businesses like Casa Taller, Taller de Diseño and VIIO, to spread awareness and catalyse adoption. The MGC will serve as a lively venue for regular events, workshops, and meetups to foster community engagement.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Phase 1: Design**\n\nWeeks 1-2: Planing\n\n*   Assemble project team and assign roles and responsibilities.\n*   Develop project charter and establish clear objectives, deliverables, and timelines.\n\nWeeks 3-4: Site Selection and Design\n\n*   Identify potential locations for the MGC and conduct site visits.\n*   Negotiate lease terms and finalize venue selection.\n\nWeeks 5-6: Procurement Planning\n\n*   Identify necessary equipment, tools, and resources for the MGC.\n*   Source vendors and obtain quotes for equipment.\n*   Develop a procurement plan and timeline.\n\n**Phase 2: Setup**\n\nWeeks 7-10: Preparations\n\n*   Begin procurement of equipment and tools based on the procurement plan.\n*   Start the hiring process for MGC staff, including roles for workshop facilitators, event coordinators, and technical support.\n*   Begin setup of the MGC according to design and layout plans.\n*   Install equipment and set up workshop, exhibit, and creation spaces.\n\nWeeks 11-12: Staff Training\n\n*   Conduct training for MGC staff on Decentraland, metaverse concepts, equipment use, SDK 7 development  and other relevant topics.\n*   Develop schedules for workshops, events, and other activities.\n\nWeeks 13-14: Launch Preparations\n\n*   Finalize schedules and plans for workshops, exhibits, and events.\n*   Develop marketing and promotional materials for the MGC launch.\n\n**Phase 3: Launch**\n\nWeeks 15-16: Official Launch\n\n*   Host the official public launch of the MGC.\n*   Begin conducting workshops, showcasing exhibits, and hosting events.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

I want to slowly buy decent items from the marketplace on stream to give away and rep. I believe we would all be happy with a bit of giving back to the people that are watching and pushing the Decentraland category on streaming sites be it straight up or winning events/games.\n\nThis wasn't meant to be serious at all but now after writing it, I don't see why it cant be serious. This is for using a very very small portion of DAO funds over a long period of time and spreading community and DAO love.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n1,000 USD in MANA\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n1 month\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x5985EB4a8e0e1f7BCa9Cc0D7AE81C2943fb205bd\n\n## Email address\n\nhelpimstreaming@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nFun and the opposite of boring.\nThis could hinder our sadness (poor us) and lighten the views of the DAO. Just think getting an item on stream which is actually from the DAO. They will have to love the DAO then!\n\"Thanks DAO\" could be the future comments from citizens.\n\nThis will give back to the community be it by the creators I slowly splurge on or the citizens that gain a free (good quality) item.\nI have a lot planned without the DAO, this would just make the participation more worth while, while also spreading the message that the DAO is a positive and fun thing and it is merely just personal human strife that gets in the way.\n\nFrom day 1 I have always given value back, be it 'WinMyFit' on X/twitter, tournaments that span up to 12 weeks long, my 12 published wearables used for giving to viewers or to winners of games, or given to other streamers to incentivise viewer retention and more.\n\nI would literally play non stop to get enough supplies to just give away.\n\nYou can now also get my wearables for free in GolfCraft.\n\nI am a known member of decentraland, I even have my name on a GolfCraft wearable because of my prowess of golf and I think more so because of my commitment to dcl.\n\nI also sometimes smell bad so I'm probably the most relatable dcl streaming citizen. I am apart of no group or clique by design.\n\nI am Helpimstreaming xxx\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThis is very open and loose as it will be a down to a per stream basis. Some streams nothing may even get minted. I will make sure that the most is made out of it by making it last and by planning and playing games/events on stream that relate to Decentraland hosted outside of Decentraland on streaming services.\nI believe I can make this last many months if not a whole year +.\nThe idea that you can get a (good quality) item is more powerful than getting one, but don't be mistaken. I aint gonna sit there baiting it to do nothing.\nI have and always have had loads of good ideas that will always be used in Decentraland with or without the DAO, this will just make it more worthwhile and more like its the DAO that is caring for pushing the dcl category on streaming sites.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should Grant Request Proposals require at least 100 VP to submit?",
    "body": "> by 0x0636211443e91468ee3657e1d7faede7059c4843 (nwiz)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Should Grant Request Proposals require at least 100 VP to submit?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=73b95760-c1d3-11ed-95a1-11f47a37eb17)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis Governance Proposal aims to add a 100 VP requirement for Grant Request submissions.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nGrants Program :\n\nThe Decentraland DAO possesses a MANA fund that has been set aside to help sponsor and facilitate the continual growth of the Decentraland platform. One avenue used by the DAO to achieve these goals is a Grants Program that was voted in place by the community.\n\nThis Grants Program allows any member of the community to request funding to help reimburse their efforts in community building and education, creating 3D content for the world, or implementing new features and improvements to the platform.\n\nGrants can be requested by completing a Proposal form within the DAO. If approved by the community, then the DAO Committee will execute the transfer of funds to the grant beneficiary by means of a one-time transfer, or a vesting contract.\n\nVP :\n\nVoting Power is represented as “VP”. MANA, LAND, NAMEs & (𝘴𝘦𝘭𝘦𝘤𝘵) L1 Wearables contribute to your total Voting Power as follows:\n\n*   1 MANA contributes 1 VP\n*   1 NAME contributes 100 VP\n*   1 LAND parcel contributes 2000 VP\n*   Wearable rarity ; Uncommon: 1 VP, Rare: 5 VP, Epic: 10 VP, Legendary: 100 VP, Mythic: 1000 VP\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, any wallet can request up to $240,000 from the Decentraland DAO with zero investment in the platform. A 100 VP requirement may reduce 'opportunistic' Grant Requests, prevent bot submissions and help alleviate voter fatigue.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nA 100 VP requirement, same as Pre-Proposal Polls, would be added to Grant Requests.\n\n\\*100 VP is a roughly $40 investment (current rate), of which could also be acquired through delegation.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nA 100 VP requirement would disincentive Grant Requests being submitted by bots or users who have no real stake in Decentraland. Also, it could help encourage participation in the DAO by setting a minimum level of engagement that must be met before a Grant can be requested.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nA check will be added to the Governance dApp to validate if the wallet has the required VP in order to submit the proposal. This will be informed to users as - 'This action requires at least 100 VP. Buy MANA to get VP, or run for delegation.'\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA 100 VP requirement for Grant Requests intends to prevent bot submissions and ensure users have some 'skin in the game' when requesting money from the Decentraland DAO.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": " Mark District X as 'stolen' ",
    "body": "> by 0x153b2252eddcb3690ae6f5e9f38be13779e1364d (REDACTED)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[District X: Contentious Leadership](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c0e5dd50-d895-11ed-bfff-7567e61aeee0)\n\n## Summary\n\nDue to contentious leadership, failure to hold up core commitments to original contributors, and improper conduct of RobL#4045 - this proposes to mark District X itself as 'stolen' on the Decentraland marketplace.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nRecently, the community has engaged in an investigation over the handling of District X, and the current leadership of RobL#4045.\n\nThis investigation has brought to light several issues:\n\nRob became custodian of District X without contributor’s input; when the original custodians left, Rob took leadership custody, alongside Carl F via a centralized decision of original leadership who could not continue.\n\nThe land is sitting in a wallet with multi-sig, controlled by an LLC that is owned entirely by Rob and a ‘partner’, no contributors were given a share despite original contributor agreement mentioning group purchase & ownership of land.\n\nRob has removed all rights from contributors, stating that he owes them nothing, and that the land is his to control.\n\nRob’s contribution to district X is believed to be 2 parcels out of 2,001 total (.099%)\n\nRob has failed to deliver financial records of the Districts performance year over year as outlined in contributor agreements, despite public information that he is renting out the land for payment.\n\nAttempts to resolve this in the District X discord has led to Rob banning or muting original contributors from District X forums such as Discord and Twitter.\n\nRob has conversed with multiple different interested parties to sell the entire district for personal gain (by transferring ownership of the LLC), for a large sum (~7 figures). Rob did not consult contributors and has stated they have no rights. When confronted - he states the assets are his and his partners to do as they please, including selling it in its entirety and keeping the money.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe believe this is wrong for a few reasons:\n\n1.) - The custodians of districts were always intended to be just that, custodians. Their job was to uphold a system in which contributors could consult or be consulted - when a custodian could no longer act in the best interests of the district, leadership should return to the foundation/DAO/contributors to continue the vision. We have seen this occur before with Rob being brought on via centralized decision by previous leadership once they could not continue.\n\n2.) - The district has completely pivoted from its original intent, while this may be acceptable in some circumstances, the decision was made by Rob without consultation of contributors. Rob has not upheld any critical pieces of the original contributor agreement nor the district foundation agreement - after four years and lack of progress, this is a massive failure, and solidifies that Rob not only has no intent to sufficiently develop the district, but also refuses to use existing methods of tracking contributor involvement on the direction - this is further complicated by Rob banning contributors who disagree, or outright deleting history/channels/servers/accounts (like the District X twitter or discord).\n\n3.) - Contributors have made multiple attempts since 2019 to raise these issues, they were either silenced by bans, or outright told they had no rights to District involvement.\nWhen raising this issue, either by contributors, or DCL’s community in general, Rob’s response has been ‘sue me’ and that he is the true ‘owner’ of these contributed lands, despite being rumored to only have contributed 2 parcels himself and little to no relevant district development occurring.\n\n4.) Many of the builds that won the Decentraland public building competition were placed on District X without consent of creators. This, alongside Rob renting land to the highest bidders (most of which seem unaware of the shady nature of the land they are renting) for personal income, is a great example of how Rob is leveraging others work in an attempt to make the district look active while not providing any useful development towards the District plan itself.\n\n5.) Rob is weaponizing the 4M District VP against the community, recently declaring it 'his' VP in an interview and continuously voting against DistrictX contributors wishes. Rob has already used DistrictX VP to deny grants to those critical of him, or to vote in favor of those that defend his claims - as this VP was not purchased by Rob, he has an unequally assigned vote which does not carry the standard investment risk, disrupting the democratic process of the DAO.\n\nSo that’s where we are now, a user who had a small contribution to district X, was deputized without the contributor’s agreement, and now has outright taken the land hostage via an LLC, refusing to release it even after 5 years of failed district leadership and instead weaponizing the power he has been assigned against original contributors and the platform itself.\n\nWe, the DAO, must find a delicate balance of defending against platform level attacks, while also carefully considering the impact any changes may have. For this reason, I believe we must only take temporary and interface level action - designed to notify and raise awareness, so that all decentralized parties may make their own informed decision.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal would add a simple 'stolen' flag on the the District X marketplace page:\n\nimage\n\nThis would be a front-end change only (including front-end APIs), bids will not be able to be placed nor sales made on the marketplace frontend. However, any user can still interact with the Decentraland contracts themselves to perform these same actions, this is not a blockchain protocol level change, simply an interface modification.\n\nThe flag can be removed with District X meeting one of the following conditions:\n\nDistrictX is placed inside a new 'locked' District contract that has no removal function, enabling delegation to a community voted leader (by District X DAO vote, fairly tokenized with original contributors share), forever removing the ability to split/sell/transfer the land.\n\nDistrictX is placed under fairly decided new decentralized leadership and DistrictX LLC is disintegrated, with DCLDAO as part of the new multi-sig as a backstop should the same issues occur.\n\nDistrictX is disintegrated and all land is returned to original contributors (although this option likely leads to many lands owned by inactive wallets, it would ensure original contributors are made whole). Any inactive wallets/land could temporarily be used as a community space by foundation/DAO until claimed.\n\nMost importantly, there will be NO contract level changes from this vote, we will not forcefully remove assets, we will not alter NFT immutability, we will simply be making a front end interface change to raise awareness about the situation as decided by the votes outcome. Should Rob/DistrictX want to move forward with removing the stolen tag, they can do so, as they will not be prevented from modifications or continuing development, all requirements to remove the stolen tag will be within District X's control.\n\nWe MUST protect the DCL community from buying or renting District X while unaware of it's history, only to find it comes with community baggage, agreements, and contributors that were supposed to be involved in decision making. We must prevent contributors from being silenced/banned and removed while their contribution is on-sold without their consent by a leader who has abandoned the outlined agreements and original contracts of contribution for personal profit.\n\nYou can find further evidence and past discussions as well as participate on this topic in the Decentraland DAO's #district discord channel: https://discord.com/channels/894658869391933540/1074369083228815390\n\nYou can also read some shorter summaries here:\nhttps://realdistrictx.medium.com/district-x-on-decentraland-a8e10279e874\nhttps://www.playdcl.games/post/decentraland-s-district-x-the-x-is-for-fraud\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGiven the points above, this is not a simple case of an unhappy consumer - this is a clear case of early good-faith users & creators being stripped of their agreed upon right to participate in the DAO (District) they contributed to, by a shoddily-appointed malicious leader seeking to extract wealth and serve only themself.\n\nWe, as the governing body of DCL, have a responsibility to resolve internal issues when attacks are carried out by the platform we have created - as a global platform, we cannot enable criminals to hide behind geo-restricted LLCs as a means to validate their coercion - we must use the DCL DAO as it is designed to resolve this problem that we ourselves have created; Especially one as complicated, nuanced and impactful to the community as District X.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xe1951ceca2cca5f7ebeb23b1dfdb8eb383f2eb1f (akasya)\n\nShould the problem/opportunity outlined be refined and taken to the next level?\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nWe believe that Decentraland is one of the top web3 metaverse project and still on its early stages. However, we see challenges in retaining users, as the excitement about the metaverse experience tends to diminish after a short period.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nLaunching Decentraland PH will enable Decentraland to expand its presence within the Filipino community, increasing its user base. The potential for user retention will be higher when the Decentraland PH metaverse experience and party gatherings are fully operational. This growth will not only result in more Decentraland users but also raise awareness about the concept of metaverse in the Philippine market.\n\nThis initiative will require Decentraland DAO to:\n\n1.  Support Decentraland PH\n2.  Delegate the acquired 3X2 estate (https://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297/tokens/5311) to Decentraland PH.\n3.  Include Decentraland PH to Townhalls and Newsletters\n4.  Allow Decentraland PH to use Decentraland branding and any tools for its growth\n\nDecentraland PH works under the umbrella of Decentraland DAO so DCL PH is required to:\n\n1.  Support Decentraland DAO.\n2.  Report to Decentraland Facilitation Squad.\n3.  Provide Metrics, Statistics, Transaction Receipts, etc.\n4.  Attend to Townhalls, AMA and other required participation by Decentraland DAO.\n5.  Use Decentraland branding in a proper manner that may promote DCL in a professional way.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nWe are proposing for the launch of Decentraland PH under the umbrella of Decentraland DAO. Decentraland PH will onboard Filipino people with the goal of user retention as we provide futuristic metaverse user experience and metaverse gatherings. We believe that metaverse experience is too good not to share to our fellow citizen so we request support from Decentraland Foundation, Decentraland DAO and the community to launch Decentraland PH.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nWe are planning to start at a very small budget to see if we can catch the attention of Filipino people, and onboard them to Decentraland within three months timeframe. We know the market conditions are tough, but we're taking a risk and launching Decentraland PH with a minimal budget, supported by Decentraland DAO. Once we show the Filipino community that Decentraland is a cool and futuristic way to connect and socialise, we can keep them engaged, which will be beneficial for both Decentraland and Decentraland DAO in various ways.\"\n\nFinally, this is a pitch proposal for Decentraland PH so the project Decentraland PH may or may not go to our team (akasya.eth, zCayel, Sunshine).\n\nCheers!\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct)\n\nShould the problem/opportunity outlined be refined and taken to the next level?\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nWhile Decentraland offers a profile dApp and a feature-rich Backpack feature in-world customization, there is a lack of a user-friendly mobile app that allows users to seamlessly showcase and personalize their avatars using the NFTs they own. The existing avatar preview app (https://github.com/decentraland/wearable-preview) provided a step in the right direction, and there was also a Grant project that started to undertake this effort but its limitations and lack of polish left room for improvement. Users could use a more accessible, visually appealing, and intuitive mobile application that enables them to experiment with various wearables and express their individuality within the metaverse.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nOur proposed solution is the creation of the a mobile backpack experience, a feature-rich mobile app designed to enable avatar customization and personal expression within Decentraland from a phone. This app will offer an immersive and visually engaging experience, allowing users to effortlessly browse, preview, and mix-and-match NFT wearables they have acquired in Decentraland.\n\nKey Features:\n\nAvatar Customization: The app will provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface that enables users to assemble their avatars by combining different wearables from their collections. This feature will grant users unparalleled creative freedom to express their unique identity.\n\nSocial Sharing: To foster a sense of community and encourage social engagement, users will have the option to share their customized avatars on social media platforms directly from the app, promoting their unique style within the Decentraland community.\n\nVirtual Showroom: The app will include a virtual showroom where users can view their avatars in different environments and lighting conditions, providing a more immersive and dynamic showcase of their personalized avatars. They could also export short videos or images to share in their social media channels.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nThe primary target audience for a mobile backpack experience includes Decentraland users who actively engage in avatar customization and NFT collecting. It would also serve younger audiences that uses their phone as their primary mean of communication and it would also create the path for a truly DCL mobile experience. This mobile app will cater to creative individuals, collectors, fashion enthusiasts, and anyone seeking to enhance their virtual presence within Decentraland.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nDecentraland is the go-to community for people wanting to express their identity through virtual worlds in a decentralized and open way. With the release of the VRM export feature, we put a step forward in the interoperability of virtual worlds and the DCL avatar is the cornerstone of a fully featured virtual identity.\nThe existing solutions have shown potential, but the demand for a more polished and accessible mobile app is evident. By addressing this issue now, we can elevate the user experience, foster deeper engagement, and empower users to truly express themselves within the metaverse.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

We will an opportunity for teachers to present 3d content and Decentraland University District is a great place to showcase this by having it equip its venues with great teaching functionality.\n\nThe goal of this initiative is to remove the barrier to entry for those wishing to use Decentraland for live coaching/training/education.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n140,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n4 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xa560bF3CfA1991116d6B836960644818a0f15DC1\n\n## Email address\n\njames@decentraland.university\n\n## Description\n\nThis grant application is to fund the creation of an open source live presenting/coaching facility which will serve the following groups:\n\n1/ Decentraland University Original Contributors who have the right to teach in the district.\n2/ The wider Decentraland Community who wish to teach live classes on LAND in Genesis City, or in DCL Worlds.\n3/ Decentraland University and other organisations who wish to deliver this functionality to clients.\n\nIt covers the creation of:\n\n\\*An NPM package compatible with SDK7 which developers can use to bring this functionality into their own scenes.\n\\*A server abstraction with a basic control server interface for running classes with the shipped reference test server.\n\\*A DCLUClassRegister smart contract which will provide the core class management storage and enrolment features.\n\\*An open source dApp which will allow LAND Operators and teachers to access admin features which are dependent on, or backed by the DCLUClassRegister smart control.\n\\*A minimal test server which also serves as a reference server implementation.\n\\*1 parcel Genesis City scene template with a fully decentralised implementation  which fully demonstrates all of the features made available by the library. This will allow developers to easily copy/paste the functionality to their scene to allow teaching in a single realm without any additional dependencies.\n\\*1 parcel Genesis scene template project with a centralised implementation based on the reference test server.  This will allow people to easily copy/paste the functionality to their scene to allow teaching across multiple realms with the requirement that they will need to host either the provided reference test server, or their own more advanced server implementation.\n\\*1 parcel DCL Worlds template with a fully decentralised implementation  which fully demonstrates all of the features made available by the library.\n\\*Comprehensive Documentation including the server specification so that developers could integrate the front end features with new or existing back end.\n\\*An open source community venue in Decentraland University provided for one 1 year equipped with the peer to peer version of the functionality.  Classroom Admin of this venue can be delegated to the DAO which can then control who has Teaching rights on the LAND. This will enable a number of community elected teachers to deliver content. (Note that if the DAO desires, we are willing for a trusted entity to hold the LAND on which the community venue resides in ESCROW for the period)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Gd4KR9V/Main-Net-Class-Management-small.png)\n\nJamesA is one of the early adopters of Decentraland having co-founded the Decentraland University district (and others) in 2017.

    "title": "A Decentraland-focused Community Hub",
    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct)\n\nShould the problem/opportunity outlined be refined and taken to the next level?\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nIn the  Decentraland, community engagement is the key to fostering creativity, collaboration, and social interactions. However, the current ecosystem lacks a comprehensive platform that effectively connects individuals with like-minded communities, in other words, it is difficult to find your **Tribe**. While there are directories for events and places, there is a notable absence of a dedicated space to list and discover groups of people with shared interests. As a result, users struggle to find and connect with communities relevant to their passions, hindering the potential for meaningful interactions and collaborations. That usually ends up happening on Discord or crypto-Twitter (crypto-X?) but that moves the focus away from the Decentraland ecosystem and from products that are built in an open, decentralized, and ethical way. I think it should be great to have a Reddit-like experience where anyone can create an index of people, places, and events that gravitates around a theme (Fashion, music, art, etc)\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nOne idea would be to create the concept of a Tribes dApp (aka Communities Hub), an integrated platform within the Decentraland Ecosystem that empowers users to explore, join, and manage memberships in various communities. This dApp will serve as a central directory, allowing individuals to easily find and connect with like-minded groups, further enriching their virtual experiences.\n\nKey Features:\n\nCommunity Listing: Users can register their communities on the platform, providing information about the community's purpose, interests, and activities. This listing will help individuals discover communities aligned with their preferences.\n\nMembership Management: Community owners will have the ability to manage memberships, ensuring that the community remains active, vibrant, and inclusive. Members can easily join and leave communities as per their preferences. Moderation and Analytics tools should be built as well.\n\nSocial Connections: The platform will enable users to connect with other community members through direct links to their Discord servers and Twitter profiles. This feature aims to strengthen social bonds within the community.\n\nIntegration with Events and Places: Community Hub dApps will integrate with existing events and places directories, providing a holistic view of the Decentraland metaverse and encouraging users to participate in community-related activities.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nThe primary target audience for Community Hub dApps includes Decentraland users who actively seek social interactions and networking opportunities within the metaverse. This platform will cater to community leaders, content creators, event organizers, enthusiasts, and newbies looking to explore and engage in various interest-based communities.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nAs Decentraland keeps growing and attracts diverse participants, fostering a sense of community and belonging becomes increasingly essential. The current lack of a dedicated platform for community listings hinders organic social connections and the growth of new groups within the metaverse. This moves the social aspect away from the in-world experience. By addressing this issue now, we can create an inclusive and engaging environment, encouraging users to form deeper connections with like-minded individuals and participate actively in community-driven initiatives.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should the Community Be the Final Arbiter in Grants Revocation Decisions ?",
    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (DCLCars)\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis proposal seeks to determine whether the Decentraland Community should have the final say in the revocation of Grants through the DAO governance process, thereby aligning the decision-making process with the principle of decentralization.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThe **[Decentraland DAO](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/what-is-the-dao/)** is the decision-making tool for MANA, NAMES and LAND holders in Decentraland’s virtual world. The DAO’s Grants Program is one of the best vehicles to help grow the Decentraland ecosystem and must be aligned with the main spirit of Decentraland - Decentralization.\n\nCurrently, the revocation of Grants is done by the **[Revocation Committee](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ce104d00-7d94-11ed-8456-a323c09ee17e)**, which may not fully reflect the Community's will. This proposal suggests that while the Revocation Committee should continue to exist and make the initial decision on whether a grant should be revoked, the final decision should rest with the Community, providing a safeguard mechanism to override the Committee's decision if necessary.\n\nGrants revocation decisions should not be delegated to a small group of individuals, instead, they should be resolved through the DAO's governance process, which was designed as a legitimate tool to mirror the Community's sentiments.\n\nBy allowing the Community to override the decisions of the Revocation Committee through the DAO governance process, we can ensure that the Grants Program remains a true reflection of the Community's desires and needs.\n\nThis proposal emphasizes the existing procedure where the Grant Support Squad and Revocation Committee can initiate a **[preventive pause or revocation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VPb33QdeFlg-qnmclWZF2Ll\\_3USLUnFO/)** of the Grant Vesting Contract when potential concerns are raised. However, this proposal suggests an enhancement to this process: the final decision on the revocation of the Grant Vesting Contract would be subject to the outcome of a Community vote. If the Community vote is in favor of the Grantee and against the revocation, the Grant Vesting Contract won't be revoked. In such a case, any preventive pause that had been initiated would be lifted and the Grant Vesting Contract along with its payments would be continued, and vice versa.\n\nVOTING OPTIONS\n\nYES: Community should be the Final Arbiter in Grants Revocation Decisions.\n\nNO: Leave as it is.\n\n- YES\n- NO\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Would you join an Unofficial DAO Discord server?",
    "body": "> by 0xd5e9ef1cedad0d135d543d286a2c190b16cbb89e (DougNFTWorld)\n\nFor the purpose of this poll, we are comparing:\n\nExisting Official DAO discord: [https://discord.com/channels/894658869391933540 ](https://discord.com/channels/894658869391933540)\n\nNew Unofficial DAO discord: [https://discord.gg/mMkUGZ5V8s ](https://discord.gg/mMkUGZ5V8s)\n\n**Problem:**\n\nThe Official Decentraland DAO discord runs great events but the channel chats are consumed with toxicity. We see the same content from the same individuals continuously. The system isn't working. The mod in there (kanwulf) has strong prior experience in moderation but has limited authority from DCL management team. Also, there are many problems with the tool being used to facilitate mutes:\n\n*   7 day mutes can be converted to 24 hour mutes by the muted individual\n*   Alt accounts can be used to submit votes\n*   The vote counts are inconsistent between users, and even between page reloads for myself personally\n*   There is no transparency in the data (we are told there are x votes of each choice as of a specific time and date but no backend data to support it)\n*   Muted individuals go right back to their previous behavior once the mute is lifted, leading to an endless cycle of personal attacks, name calling, and harassment by the same individuals continuously\n\nAs a result, the content of the server is not as productive as it could be if it were moderated more strictly similar to most other discord servers. Valuable community members withhold their participation in the discussions either out of disinterest in the immature and unproductive content, or for fear of becoming a target themselves.\n\nAt the root of the problem is a system that is broken which has been chosen by a select few individuals behind the scenes with very little transparency. Key community members have all but begged for bigger changes to be made for enforcing the rules of the server but the behind-the-scenes decision makers continue to govern the server with policies that favor the toxic individuals.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nI would like to gauge interest from the community in creation of an Unofficial DCL DAO discord that would be enforced more strictly. The same rules apply, but with less tolerance, especially from repeat offenders.\n\nKey differences in this server include:\n\n*   Stricter enforcement of the rules by mods with complete authority - not community votes through a clunky tool (such as that which the official server uses)\n*   Consequences shall be applied to toxic individuals directly, rather than being shared by the community. For example, Slowmode will not be used. The voice of the community at large shall not be limited due to toxic behavior from a few individuals\n*   Alt accounts will be limited. To enforce this, users who join the server with accounts created less than 2 weeks prior will be autobanned. Valid brand new users may rejoin after the 2 week period. Inactive users will be purged (criteria for this may change periodically to limit abuse by bad actors). Of course, even with all this and other measures, there is no sure way to prevent determined users from using alt accounts on Discord, so alt accounts shall not be banned outright. As long as the content posted from any account adheres to the rules and meets a standard of productivity, it doesn't matter which account its posted from anyway as long as the user has good intentions. If someone has a valid personal reason and is willing to expend the extra effort to switch between accounts to post valuable content with good intentions, then so be it. However, abuse will not be tolerated (such as using alt accounts to agree with themselves, or push their own agenda).\n*   Feedback from the community will be incorporated in a more transparent manner\n\nIn addition to offering a safer and more productive environment to facilitate DAO discussion, the Unofficial DCL DAO discord may also offer additional in-world meetup events, community exposure opportunities, and other utility outside of what is currently provided in the Official Decentraland DAO discord.\n\nIf you would like to see the server in action before casting your vote, please feel free to pop in and see if this is something you can get behind:\n[https://discord.gg/mMkUGZ5V8s ](https://discord.gg/mMkUGZ5V8s)\n\nAdditional thoughts and ideas are welcome below!\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

In those screenshots, you can see how Saltilisatis writes exactly like HP and talks about the same topics.\n\nThe Saltilisatis account was started in 2020, pretending to be a new user of Decentraland, to be targeted by crypto scammers whom HP would later ban from his main account. Later on, it seems that HP decided to use the account to say things he didn't have the courage to at the DAO. Moreover, this account started unnecessary fights and made ill-advised comments.\n\nNow, the 'Saltilisatis' account has been removed by Kyllian since he was exposed. I think Kyllian should apologize, adopt a more professional approach, and avoid such actions in the future.\n\nP.S: Check out the screenshots someone sent. All the messages from Saltilisatis disappeared after they were shared by the user #HPExposed.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/oEGsFZz\nhttps://i.imgur.com/IhHcYTF.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Fx1H1ha.png\n\n- Invalid question/options\n- Invalid question/options\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Creators are the people who make UGC platforms magical, and we are here to support them.\n\nOur platform allows independent artists & studios to create profiles and build their portfolios, get hired by top level brands / agencies & gain more visibility across all types of virtual worlds.\n\nWith this project, our goal is to use the experience of all the campaigns we did so far to innovate & grow the creative input in Decentraland. Our last campaign generated more than 200 unique assets, scenes & wearables by dozens of creators.\n\nBy leading with creativity, we aim to onboard, educate & fund new creators while providing opportunities to already existing creators in the space.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x77BD4E9BB7094F92fb93b08cF5C368503CCd6c41\n\n## Email address\n\noscom@sandstorm.co\n\n## Description\n\nThe Sandstorm platform has 4 main live features actively used by 15+ Virtual world platforms:\n\n*   Contests\n*   Proposals\n*   Analytics\n*   Server hosting service\n\nWebsite: app.sandstorm.co\n\nThis project will be concentrated around using Contests & Proposals\n\nHere is how it works:\n\n*   1 \"project round\" has 1 theme and lasts a month\n*   On launch of the project round, 1 proposal with a budget of 18000$ (total budget of the project round) is initiated.\n*   Creators & Studios will be able to apply for the project round with IDEAS & PROJECT CONCEPTS, as well as the amount they want to be compensated for the work. It is expected that creators provide in depth descriptions as to why they should be funded.\n*   Each Creator / Studio will be able to do 1 request, and each funding request can be of a maximum of 2000$ to help them realize their idea.\n*   Simultaneously, an open contest will be launched for people who want to participate without requesting funding OR creators who want to produce more than 1 project. That contest will last over the course of a month and only grant extra visibility.\n\nNote: Sandstorm being a US company, following US regulations & laws, we are required to KYC users in order to issue monetary compensations.\n\nThis means that per round, a minimum of 9 projects will be produced. Each project having its own scope & being able to consist of 1 more extensive scene OR a full suite of wearables OR a full suite of emotes OR a full suite of assets, it is to be expected that more than 500 individual assets will be produced by over 45 unique designers / studios over the timeline of this campaign.\n\nEach project will be individually marketed on release by the creators & Sandstorm.\nSandstorm will additionally leverage their network to put creators in touch with event hosts & production teams - this will help further content production down the line, outside of the scope of this initiative.\n\nWithin the proposal description, there will be included:\n\n*   The overall THEME of the project round\n*   Technical expectations (Decentraland guidelines)\n*   Description of the above\n*   An expected Delivery Deadline\n\nThrough our management infrastructure, we will handle oversight of projects & make sure all creators deliver on time.\nExample of a Virtual World successfully leveraging Sandstorm as production & creative partner: https://twitter.com/OfficialTCGCoin\n\nIn the Budget rundown, we added example themes that could be tied to a Round of initiatives.\n\nIn addendum: If this goes through, we will provide our Streaming hosting infrastructure for free to the DCL Facilitation Squad for them to host their Townhalls, workshops & events in world.\n\nWe @ the Sandstorm team hope that you are as excited about this initiative as we are.\nTime to get creative in Decentraland!\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nI. Preparation:\n\nContent planing & preparation\n\nII. Execution:\n\nMonth #1: Project round 1 launched, creators hired, productions initiated\nMonth #2: Project round 2 launched, creators hired, productions initiated\nMonth #3: Project round 3 launched, creators hired, productions initiated (All creators / Studios completed Round 1)\nMonth #4: Project round 4 launched, creators hired, productions initiated (All creators / Studios completed Round 2)\nMonth #5: Project round 5 launched, creators hired, productions initiated (All creators / Studios completed Round 3)\nMonth #6: Project round 6 launched, creators hired, productions initiated (All creators / Studios completed Round 4)\n\nNote: Depending on production speed of designers, there might be an Add-on of 1-2 months until Rounds 4 & 5 are fully completed. In that case, the Month 1-4 designs will already be open-sourced.\n\nIII. Completion:\n\nCollect all productions, reorganize them & open source to the Decentraland community\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xed7461fd98758a84b76d6e941cbb92891443c36f\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should community member jar0d be permanently banned from the Decentraland DAO Discord server?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d463ba10-2687-11ee-a12f-1f19cf585630)\n\n## Summary\n\nI propose that current Decentraland DAO Discord server community member jar0d be permanently banned from the Decentraland DAO Discord server and permanently banned from all DAO proposal discussion Forums.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Decentraland DAO Discord server is a place where many community members gather in hopes of engaging in relevant and insightful conversations pertaining to the Decentraland DAO.\n\nWhile disagreements often occur, for the most part the community is able to engage in these disagreements respectfully.\n\nHowever, community member jar0d has a very long history of being verbally combative and disrespectful toward nearly all other community members, and engages in this activity nearly every single day.\n\nIn fact, since the DAO instituted a mute mechanism, jar0d is one of the most muted member of the community.\n\nJar0d has repeatedly referred to community members by disrespectful an derogatory names that include but are not limited to:\n\nDumb Bitch\nBitch\nBigot\nTransphobe\nSack of Shit\nHuman Fleshlight\n\nJar0d's vulgar language inside the server and in the DAO proposal discussions forums, which often includes profanity angers and escalate tensions between himself and other community members.\n\nAs a result of Jar0ds disruptive conversations, on many occasions the entire channel has been put on a cooldown to slow communications. In effect, due to the actions of one instigator, the entire community is constantly being punished and therfore cannot effectively communicate.\n\nIn my opinion, having observed the discussions of jar0d over many months, and despite the innumerous warning he has received to cease (and many mutes), he has continued to irritate, antagonize, and intimidate good people to the point many no longer choose to participate in DAO discussions out of fear of being verbally attacked and abused by jar0d.\n\nWhile some have called for more forceful moderation, I believe that action is an unnecessary policing of the entire community to simply mitigate the unacceptable actions of one member.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs I mentioned, jar0d has a very long history of being disruptive. He has received many public warnings; many have attempted to converse with him about his unacceptable behaviors privately via DMS; he has been muted many times; nothing has seemed to have worked, as he continues to this day to use the Decentraland DAO discord as his personal platform to engage in harassing, abusive, disruptive, and often libelous behaviors.\n\nIf the community would like the Decentraland DAO Discord to once again be a platform where they can freely express their ideas, views, and concerns without the fear being incessantly attacked, then there must be accountability. In my opinion, those whose seemingly sole purpose of existence is to intentionally disrupt, irritate and annoy, should be permanently removed from the community.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPermanently ban jar0d from the Decentraland DAO Discord server and permanently ban jar0d from all DAO proposal discussion Forums.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt is my hope that all of jar0d’s victims, both past and present, read this proposal and take the necessary action to permanently ban him.\n\nIn doing so, it is my hope that the Decentraland DAO community can once again reclaim their right to engage with other members free from the fear of harassment. And approving this action will also serve as a deterrent and reminder to all others that the type of behavior that jar0d has for too long engaged in will no longer be tolerated within our community.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xd5bdc028aaeab8d8fa1c5bb577b6c4c3402559f6\n\nShould the following $8,000 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nDigital Person is a pioneering project that redefines the concept of digital identities in the virtual world. Leveraging the power of Web3 technologies, our project aims to create unique, user-owned 3D avatars that can be minted as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and transacted in a decentralized manner. Additionally, we intend to harness distributed storage systems for secure and decentralized account data storage. This project, therefore, not only democratizes digital identities but also contributes to the thriving Web3 ecosystem. Through the development of a dynamic avatar marketplace, Digital Person enhances user creativity, fosters collaboration, and promotes commerce in the emerging virtual space.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n8,000 USD in MANA\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n1 month\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xd5bDc028aaEAb8D8fa1C5Bb577b6C4C3402559F6\n\n## Email address\n\nalextitonis@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nDigital Person is a cutting-edge 3D avatar project developed using the top-tier 3js engine. The project aims to disrupt how users interact with their digital personas in the emerging virtual ecosystem. Through this project, we plan to integrate Web3 technologies to leverage their decentralized attributes, thereby enhancing the ownership, interaction, and portability of these digital personas.\n\nThe planned integration will allow users of Digital Person to connect their blockchain wallets, mint their avatars as unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and send them over the blockchain. This mechanism doesn't just reinforce the concept of decentralized ownership; it also opens the gates to a vibrant marketplace for user-generated digital avatars, offering limitless opportunities for creativity, collaboration, and commerce.\n\nAdditionally, our project intends to utilize distributed storage services for account storage. This approach assures users that their digital identities are secured and decentralized, as data stored via distributed storage is duplicated and distributed across several network nodes worldwide. This model guarantees data persistence and high availability - vital qualities in the fast-evolving virtual space.\n\nThe integration of Web3 and the use of distributed storage are expected to result in a seamless user experience where each user can genuinely own, manage, and transact their unique digital avatars without the need for intermediaries.\n\nThe grant we seek will be utilized to develop this integration, refine our user interface for seamless blockchain wallet interactions, and enhance the security of our minting process. This funding will also enable us to conduct comprehensive testing, improve our documentation, and ultimately foster a dynamic community around the Digital Person project.\n\nOur vision with Digital Person is to set a new standard for digital identity in the web3 era. This project represents a significant step towards a future where every individual can have an interactive, portable, and truly owned digital persona in the virtual world. The integration of Web3 and the use of distributed storage will not only help us reach this goal but also contribute to the overall growth and diversity of the blockchain and Web3 ecosystem.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur roadmap is as follows:\n\n    Web3 integration for wallet connectivity (est. $3,500)\n    Development of avatar minting and transaction functionalities (est. $2,500)\n    Integration with distributed storage for account data (est. $2,000)\n    User testing and feedback collection (est. $2,000)\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "No-Code Broadcasting Tool with Analytics and Wallet-Based Content Access Capabilities",
    "body": "> by 0xbe6511496c78932b2f7cc5f7bc63df8ec23ea904 (Ev)\n\nDear Community,\n\nWe would like to hear your opinion about the initiative to provide a no-code tool to broadcast, manage and monetize content for event organizers and landowners in Decentraland.\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nOver the past year, in collaboration with Decentraland Foundation, we have developed, tested and piloted a no-code tool for broadcasting, managing, and moderating high-quality videos, static imagery, social media, and NFTs.\n\nIf you attended MVFW23 and MVMF22 events, you’ve probably seen our tool in action. Here is an overview of these projects: https://decentraland.org/blog/community-projects/community-spotlight-dowows-interactive-billboards\n\nOur primary objectives for developing such a content curation tool were:\n\n*   To enhance community engagement and facilitate new business models, such as event/brand sponsorships and broadcasting partner content, within the Decentraland events ecosystem.\n*   To address infrastructure limitations that hinder high-quality content delivery due to server limitations.\n\nTo give you a deeper understanding of what the tool can do, we've prepared a screen recording of our demo (https://youtu.be/FeEFxtz8EVw) and outlined the key features below:\n\n*   **High-quality imagery and video broadcasting.** Allows to simultaneously broadcast several image and video items in high-quality, providing event organizers and landowners the ability to enhance visual experiences, elevate display quality, and ultimately attract more partners and sponsors.\n\n*   **Real-time content moderation.** Allows to alter, swap, display, or hide content without needing to redeploy scenes. Gives an opportunity to display multiple content items simultaneously or back-to-back.\n\n*   **Scheduling content for display.** Allows to schedule any item to appear at specified times, or to set a specific display cadence. Ads flexibility and provides dynamic control over your event's or scene’s content.\n\n*   **Customizable display screen.** Allows to create virtual screens of standard or custom sizes and to segment screens into various content blocks. You can display different types of content on each segment. Create unique, personalized environments that better reflect your brand or event theme.\n\n*   **“REAL-TIME” feature.** Ensures a synchronized viewing experience for all users, prevents videos from restarting when a user exits and re-enters a scene, creating an uninterrupted experience.\n\n*   **Versatile content playlists.** Allows to aggregate content in different formats like social media feeds, NFTs, DCL marketplace wearables, and more, in playlists - enhance the depth and breadth of content shared.\n\n*   **Interactivity.** Allows to integrate links, buttons, or DCL coordinates for teleportation between scenes. You can also control video playback, choosing whether or not to include sound. Enhances user engagement and convenience for event attendees and land visitors.\n\n*   **Virtual displays.** Allows you to create multiple screens for all your campaigns and events. Manage all your content from a single hub, enabling easy curation for your marketing and content teams and display of interactive content across multiple parcels.\n\n*   **Live streaming.** Allows to go live in DCL instantly, with compatibility for OBS or Restream systems / m3u8. Host real-time events, presentations, concerts, or meetings.\n\n*   **Blockchain-agnostic NFT display.** Allows to integrate and display NFTs without being limited to any specific blockchain e.g display display (DCL Wearables), SOL and ETH NFTs side-by-side. We are working to include more blockchains.\n\n*   **Universal embed capabilities.** You can embed doWow screens anywhere, from your scenes in DCL to your website, smartphone, digital-out-of-home screen, or even a TV.\n\n**PLANS**\n\nCurrently, this tool is only available for custom large projects with our team's direct involvement. However, we want to make it accessible to everyone in Decentraland to easily integrate into their scenes, possibly as part of the Decentraland builder.\n\nAdditionally, we would also like to develop the following functionality and features:\n\n*   **Analytics dashboard** to view all content interactions (impressions, engagement, average watch time of your content, number of clicks, geography, etc.);\n\n*   **Wallet-based content access system** to manage and control access to displayed items. For example, you can decide who can view and interact with your content based on what tokens or NFTs are present in wallets. This system would help creators to monetize their work, by setting up paywalls or ticket systems for events, or gating exclusive content. In the longer term, this feature would pave the way to creating programmatic scene management options where creators could tailor their content to specific audiences based on age, interest, and other factors.\n\nWe estimate that this work would require 6 to 8 months and around 85,000 USD (we’re working on a more detailed budget), and we intend to apply for the DAO grant for this purpose.\n\nCONSIDERATIONS\n\nBefore submitting our proposal, we would like to hear your opinion on the following:\n\n*Do you think such a tool can help you increase your event, campaign, scene or experience engagement, and attract more sponsors/partners?*\n\n**About us**\n\nWe're a team of event organizers, growth marketers, and live streamers. In 2021, we initiated doWow, a tool to manage, broadcast, and share digital content across various platforms including websites, DooH, and the metaverse.\n\nOur interaction with Decentraland began in the summer of 2022 when we received startup funding from the European Commission. We decided to use this opportunity to bring a user-friendly content management system to a metaverse platform to facilitate events. We chose Decentraland as our starting point due to its active community, openness, and established event scene.\n\nIn June 2022, we collaborated with the Decentraland Foundation to develop a pilot for the Metaverse Music Festival and Metaverse Fashion Week. Since then, we've been focusing on improving our tool and collecting feedback from event organizers in Decentraland. Our aim is to make it universally accessible and encourage its use.\n\nOur team:\n\nEvgeniya Panova (partnerships)\nMatthew Tuccio (product)\nVolodymyr Iatsyshyn (technical development)\nLea Dannenhauer (web development)\nJames Watkins (virtual events development)\nOctavia Burghelea (community management)\n\n- Yes, I would like to use this tool\n- No, I don't see the need for such tool\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

In this case, the grantee requested a Documentation Grant, which was not compliant with the Category, but the proposal was valuable for community building and onboarding new members.\n\nThere are also valuable DAO members that make community-building experiences and events, like [ABC Decentraland](https://twitter.com/ABCDecentraland), or [CBD - Community Building Decentraland](https://twitter.com/CBDecentraland) who share knowledge with newcomers and ignite interaction among Decentraland users and DAO members.\n\nOn the other hand, in the near past, the community has voted YES for the [Ambassador Program](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=52de99e0-f27c-11ed-9bc2-e5fe350d0c93), and one of the principal objectives was to empower community members. We strongly agree with the spirit of the proposal, and think it would be a good investment to support these valuable community stewards that make the experience in Decentraland more exciting and fun.\n\nWith these inputs, we hosted an [open session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fds9-b9geLY) with the community to discuss the creation of a new category in the Grants program, named Community Building, which brings us here with the following inputs:\n\n**What type of grants would a Community Building Category fund?**\n\n*   In-world exploration: Building specific events to explore the wonderful experiences of Decentraland.\n*   Increase engagement: Contribute to increase in times on scene, and returning users.\n*   Organize gatherings: Produce meetups for community building.\n*   Community Interaction: Exchanging wearables, collectibles, and emotes.\n\nThis category would be dedicated to recognizing and supporting individuals or groups who actively contribute to the growth, development, and engagement of the Decentraland community, fostering collaboration and positive experiences within the metaverse.\n\nIf the community decides to create this new category, the next step would  be to:\n\n*   Escalate this into a draft proposal, including requirements and performance metrics for the Community Building category.\n*   Create a poll to re-distribute the budget of the grants program including this category.\n\nIf the community decides not to move forward with this new category, the next step will be to:\n\n*   According to the insights of this [article](https://medium.com/decentrland-dao/dao-grants-program-quarterly-insights-308913de2a29), create a poll to re-distribute the % of the grants program budget.\n\n- Yes - Add the Community Building category\n- No - Do not create the Community Building category\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x2a4b8508b0fb552ac4a0f4795f22f9495fafbba9 (VBONE)\n\nShould the following $5,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal asks the DAO for funding to create an exact two-story floorplan replica of a famous house shown annually on TV which cannot be named for trademark reasons. Perhaps you will recognize this house as it is BBig in the USA and Great Britain. Two very talented and motivated teams (VBONE and Crypton Studio) with substantial Decentraland building experience are being leveraged to create this very popular house. This house (file ready for upload) will be made available on https://crypton.studio for FREE so that anyone can download and place one. Detailed, easy-to-follow instructions for uploading this scene into Decentraland will be provided on the website as well. Please make us the “head of the house” for this grant.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xF39bC4E5dD4C12F11717f099818997686B01498B\n\n## Email address\n\ngchistyakov@crypton.studio\n\n## Description\n\nThe greatest parts about Decentraland in our eyes are the limitless 3D creative possibilities that can be generated in this metaverse. We believe that the major draw of attention and users to the platform will be engagement through in-world content. That is why we are excited to undertake this project. We want to share our passion and vision with what Decentraland can be with the world.\n\nWe will painstakingly create a replica of this BBig house, down to the finest polygon detail allowable. The idea will be rendered using Blender as our team has extensive experience in this platform. A detailed description of the precise development process can be found under the Roadmap and Milestones section below.\n\nIt is important to note that this scene is 3 X 6 plots in size. This will allow in-world placement (My Land) for those that have large estates while also allowing anyone with access to private worlds (My World) to place this mind-blowing scene.\n\nFloorplan design:\nDraft floorplan link: https://i.imgur.com/BF7hssK.png\n\nOur (VBONE and Crypton Studio) achievements so far:\n\nVBONE in-world scene: https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-11%2C-126\\&realm=heimdallr\\&island=peer-wc1fwz\n\n5 wearables from a VBONE collection available on the marketplace: https://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0xf782a6a74173dbb6cff1e381f75ebd7f0e03f666/items/3\n\nThis scene consists of a 3-floor building-observatory and rocket silo. Quest allows users to play the mini-game.\nhttps://play.decentraland.org/?position=45,42\n\nVBONE socials: https://linktr.ee/vbone\nCrypton website: https://crypton.studio\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nTimeline:\n\nOur devs at Crypton Studio will be contracted (internally) to create and modify this build using these funds. Based upon our previous Decentraland Asset and Wearable experience, we anticipate that this build will take approximately 120 hours making this about $41/hour given the $5000 budget. The typical contract job that we take for 3D design concept work is $50-200/hour making this venture one that is based upon our desire to establish a strong footprint in Decentraland rather than for immediate profit. Depending upon the logistical availability of our devs we expect this job to take 4-8 weeks.\n\nRoadmap and Milestones:\n\nMonth 1:\n\n\\-Design each “room” using screenshots from the TV show placed in the context of the floorplan blueprint using Blender.\n\n\\-Create scene features with Blender.\n\n\\-Utilize the Decentraland editor (SDK7) in conjunction with Blender-generated items to create the BB house scene.\n\nMonth 2:\n\n\\-Testing scene functionality in-world and making modifications as needed to improve visual and functional features.\n\nMonth 3:\n\n\\-If needed, additional scene testing before final deployment and upload to https://crypton.studio\n\n\\*Note that we will make improvements and add features to this scene likely long past this grant period.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Diversify 5-10% of the DCLDAO Treasury for permanent on-chain income",
    "body": "> by 0x8b257b97c0e07e527b073b6513ba8ea659279b61 (Morph)\n\nAsset diversification is a well founded strategy to not only build, but protect wealth long term.\n\nAs a DAO that is entirely MANA driven, we are in a unique position that we should always bet on ourselves and assume MANA is our safest and most valuable asset.\n\nHowever, there is no yield associated, we rely entirely on the dependence of selling MANA, causing downward pressure in our economy. This is proving to not be enough, and as vesting runs out, we may find ourselves quickly depleting while also hurting the economy we've built.\n\nThe DAO would benefit greatly from yield that is:\n\n1.) An integral part of our platform ecosystem (I.e. Eth/Matic).\n\n2.) Provides some kind of other net benefit to DCL ecosystem\n\nThis proposal intends to mark out 5-10% of the DAO's current funds, and place them into sensible, proven, on-chain, decentralized yield - no trading, it is a one time investment not intended to ever be sold. If successful, this can be scaled, and with overall growth of the industry, significantly reduce or even cover our monthly costs in $USD without selling MANA.\n\n***Suggested Yield***\n\n*1.) Ethereum Validator Nodes - Portfolio Majority (50-75%)*\n\nCurrently, Ethereum offers us a yield of ~3.5-6%, but more importantly, it offers that yield in Eth which is inherently deflationary alongside network usage. On top of this, the Matic/DCL ecosystem is built as a layer 2 system on top of Ethereum, one of the oldest and longest running smart contract chains that has successfully upgraded many times.\n\nRecommended decentralized staking options:\nRocketPool (rETH)\nLido (stEth)\n\n![Eth Yield](https://i.imgur.com/IGtV4iF.png)\n\n*2.) Mana/Matic & Mana/Eth LPs*\n\nMana based LPs have an inherently good functionality that benefits the ecosystem by adding liquidity depth (as opposed to just selling MANA on the open market). They also earn a yield in both assets, giving us a way to earn back MANA and another native asset we can sell for income without affecting our economy negatively.\n\nAll of these assets are relatively correlated to the general market, while we may experience ups and downs in our USD price, the overall correlation to MANA should be relatively stable, preventing impermanent loss. This gives us stable, secure, on-chain yield that does not need to be touched, and the profits can be redistributed back into the DAOs treasury when needed.\n\nOpen to any other suggestion! I believe 1.) & 2.) are the most optimal in terms of R:R and should be the majority (due to their liquidity deepness & proven on chain yield), however, there is room for a micro-allocation (5-10%) towards other yield strategies that may be less proven but yield higher in terms of market exuberance.\n\n***This brings the next complication, how/when to diversify:***\nSelling MANA on the open market should not be done lightly, especially when it's a larger portion of the portfolio.\n\nFor this reason, it is suggested we use an algorithmic decision to methodically diversify, removing user decision from the process.  Here is the suggested conditions.\n\nWe will separate the investment (5-10%) into 1% 'chunks' (i.e. 5-10 total chunks), these bullets will be fired at the discretion of the multisig signers, across liquid DEX's, when the following  conditions are met:\n\n*   RSI above 70 on daily timeframe\n*   Above 200MA on daily timeframe\n\nThis combination is a great measurement of 'market exuberance', it is NOT a guarantee to sell at the highest point, but is a guarantee that we sell into times of unusual buy pressure. This ensures we do not Rug/dump our own token price or sell during a time of market despair, and also makes it likely we are selling into larger whale buyers and speculators, not retail buyers / DCL citizens.\n\nFor an example, within the last year this would have presented three 'diversification events' that would not only have yielded us income, but assisted with stability in recent turbulence.\n![ExampleBuyin](https://i.imgur.com/t5uOYoY.png)\n\nI hope this draft proposal stirs some conversation around the unbalanced monthly income/expenses, and how we can reduce the constant sell pressure of MANA long term. If this strategy is proven to be successful, it is my hope that our treasury could not only grow but be as much as 50% diversified with proven, on chain yield that supports our ecosystem.\n\nIf one day, the DAO treasury runs dry, this may very well be the final bastion that keeps the lights on for the open source community.  We must outlast beyond the vesting contract.\n\n- Invest 5% of current treasury\n- Invest 10% of current treasury\n- Do not diversify treasury\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Limit Fund Appropriation to Grant Proposals",
    "body": "> by 0x5b5cc427c1d81db4f94de4d51d85ce122d63e244 (Fehz)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Limit Fund Appropriation to Grant Proposals](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=dca499e0-3f03-11ed-9eb2-21be7ab68113)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to restrict the appropriation of funds from the Decentraland DAO to the established Grants Framework.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal advocates for limiting fund appropriations from the Decentraland DAO to the established new [Grants Framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=77475620-7b74-11ed-ad27-015f26e7c35c) approved on December 28, 2022. And it comes as a response to previous instances where funds were allocated through binding governance proposals, raising questions about the legitimacy of such actions. By implementing this measure, the DAO aims to ensure that all project and initiative funding adheres to the approved Grants Framework.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe motivation behind this proposal stems from past events where the Decentraland DAO allocated [$1 million USD in MANA to Decentral Games (ICE-USDC liquidity pool) to incentivize Daily Active Users (DAUs)](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=99c66b90-e2d2-11ec-9000-175d8dd584b8). This allocation was done through a Binding Governance Proposal as it did not fit within the existing Grants Framework's parameters. While it was neither explicitly permitted nor prohibited under current DAO rules, it triggered crucial discussions.\n\nTwo key questions emerged from this incident:\n\n1.  Is it appropriate to appropriate funds outside of the previously agreed Grants program framework, such as through binding governance proposals?\n2.  Is the existing Grants Program framework adequately designed to accommodate all funding needs of the DCL community, especially for special projects with more flexible distribution models?\n\nThe DAO approved a new Grants Program framework with updated categories and requirements to address these concerns. This led to the creation of the \"**Grant Accelerator**\" category as a way to provide private companies or revenue-generating initiatives to request investments from the DAO.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal's main objective is to restrict the appropriation of funds from the Decentraland DAO to the established Grants Framework. This restriction explicitly prohibits the use of binding governance proposals as a means to receive money from the DAO treasury.\n\nOutside this restriction is the compensation of the committee’s team members that have been established through binding Governance proposals (Such as the DAO Committee, Wearables Curation Committee, or Revocations Committee).\n\nIn all other cases, the Grants Framework serves as the sole mechanism for requesting and receiving DAO funding.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\n*   Streamlined Funding Process: The proposal eliminates the use of binding governance proposals for fund allocation, which may have been less structured and consistent in comparison to the Grants Framework.\n\n*   Mitigation of Loopholes: The proposal serves as a stop-gap measure to close potential loopholes in the governance and grant-making process. It prevents future instances of unauthorized appropriations of DAO funds for projects and initiatives outside the established Grants Framework.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe approval of this proposal will prohibit the use of binding governance proposals as a means to receive money from the DAO treasury.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs the Decentraland DAO evolves, it must remain adaptable to changing circumstances while developing an agile and robust governance system. This proposal acts as a stop-gap measure to address potential loopholes in the governance and grant-making process. While long-term solutions are explored and implemented, this measure will ensure that all funding aligns with the approved Grants Program framework and prevent appropriations through binding governance proposals.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should community member jar0d be permanently banned from the Decentraland DAO Discord server?",
    "body": "> by 0xed7461fd98758a84b76d6e941cbb92891443c36f\n\nI propose that current Decentraland DAO Discord server community member jar0d be permanently banned from the Decentraland DAO Discord server.\n\nThe Decentraland DAO Discord server is a place where many community members gather in hopes of engaging in relevant and insightful conversations pertaining to the Decentraland DAO.\n\nWhile disagreements often occur, for the most part the community is able to engage in these disagreements respectfully.\n\nHowever, community member jar0d has a very long history of being verbally combative and disrespectful toward nearly all other community members, and engages in this activity nearly every single day.\n\nIn fact, since the DAO instituted a mute mechanism, jar0d holds the title for being the most muted member of the community.\n\nIn fact, just today, jar0d had repeatedly called other member a bigot in an apparent attempt to cause anger and escalate tensions. As a result, the entire channel was put on a 6-hour cooldown. In effect, due to the actions of one instigator, the entire community is punished and cannot effectively communicate.\n\nIn my opinion, having observed the discussions of jar0d over many months, and despite the innumerous warning he has received to cease, he has continued to irritate, antagonize, and intimidate good people to the point many no longer choose to participate in DAO discussions out of fear of being verbally attacked and abused by jar0d.\n\nWhile some have called for more forceful moderation, I believe that action is an unnecessary policing of the entire community to simply mitigate the unacceptable actions of one member.\n\nAs I mentioned, jar0d has a very long history of being disruptive. He has received many public warnings; many have attempted to converse with him about his unacceptable behaviors privately via DMS; he has been muted many times; nothing has seemed to have worked, as he continues to this day to use the Decentraland DAO discord as his personal platform to engage in harassing, abusive, disruptive, and often libelous behaviors.\n\nIf the community would like the Decentraland DAO Discord to once again be a platform where they can freely express their ideas, views, and concerns without the fear being incessantly attacked, then there must be accountability. In my opinion, those whose seemingly sole purpose of existence is to intentionally disrupt, irritate and annoy, should be permanently removed from the community.\n\nIt is my hope that all of jar0d’s victims, both past and present, read this proposal and take the necessary action.\n\nIn doing so, it is my hope that the Decentraland DAO community can once again reclaim their right to engage with other members free from the fear of harassment. And approving this action will also serve as a deterrent and reminder to all others that the type of behavior that jar0d has for too long engaged in will no longer be tolerated within our community.\n\n- Yes, permanently ban member jar0d from the Decentraland DAO Discord server\n- No, do not ban member jar0d from the Decentraland DAO Discord server\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Additionally, there will be a small percentage of each project's equity available to the SeedStarter platform (https://twitter.com/JoinSeedstarter) so that the viewers and DCL community can have a chance at any projects they are interested in.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x9a712335ded8455a623a51046f7baabd604a337c (GoldiLox)\n\nShould the following $35,000 grant in the Social Media Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nGoldilox and MetaLyss have been established community members of Decentraland with a combined total of 35 months in this space. Together, we have produced a countless amount of content featuring Decentraland, covering a wide variety of social media platforms to include YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and now with the launch of Threads we have a unique opportunity to potentially attract external audiences to Decentraland. This led to the creation of Blockchain Social, our objective is to address negative PR, draw in high-quality users, and back women entrepreneurs in the Web3 domain. Funding from the DAO Grant will empower us to increase the amount and caliber of the Social Media material in the various platforms.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n35,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x8f9cf5057ba118551770b498Cf07398B968a636a\n\n## Email address\n\nblockchainsocial.eth@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nProblem Statement-\n\n*   Blockchain Social believes one of the key issues Decentraland is facing is negative PR from influencers predominantly in the Web2 Space. Unfavorable publicity by social media influencers has the potential to disturb the percentage of conversions among the general public engaging with the Decentraland platform. Inaccurate details and uncertainty could lead to skepticism related to the platform's value proposition as we can see with Folding Idea’s YouTube Video “The Future is a Dead Mall - Decentraland and the Metaverse”\n    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiZhdpLXZ8Q\\&t=2789s) This is one example, in which an influencer has surgically crafted a video to increase fear, uncertainty, doubt which results in misinformation. The Blockchain Social aim’s to create content which combats the negative PR, and present to the  populace the true marvels of Decentraland.\n\nSolution-\n\n*   Blockchain Social will create and produce content to tackle unfavorable perceptions of Decentraland. This can assist in showcasing the true wonders of what Decentraland has to offer. Through creating high-grade, high-quality material, our goal is to draw in unique visitors. In addition, we strive to highlight the work efforts of different communities within this space such as Wilderness, Elo Chess Club, DecentralGames, Mo Beatz, Decentraland Worlds, etc. The information will emphasize the distinctive characteristics of the platform, user interactions, and options for participation.\n\nBenefits-\n\n*   Improved Conversion Rates: Blockchain Social will combat negative PR by creating positive engaging content throughout all social media platforms. Through this effort, the team confidently believes it will boost conversion rates in Decentraland by resolving uncertainties and showcasing the platform's value offerings.\n\n*   Enhanced Reputation: By creating high-quality organic material, Blockchain Social strives to boost Decentraland's image among the Web3 ecosystem. This will present Decentraland as trustworthy , dependable, and will attract more high-quality users to the platform by promoting positive narratives and countering negative PR.\n\n*   Empowering Women in Web3: Blockchain Social is dedicated to backing women in business within the Web3 network. In alignment with our objective, we will provide dedicated support, guidance, and connection opportunities to empower women in the Web 3 domain. In addition, we will  expand these initiatives beyond Decentraland to the larger Web3 domain by “cross pollinating” which will foster a supportive environment for women entrepreneurs.\n\nIn addition, the team aims to create at a minimum 20 engaging posts, 30 instagram stories, 10 videos, and 4 blog posts (400 word minimum) a month to recap events occurring throughout Decentraland, which will serve as a unique repository of amazing events that happen throughout the year. Funding from the grant, will bolster the quantity and quality of content capturing the unique moments in Decentraland.\n\nLastly, Blockchain Social will aim to support women within the Web3 platform, by collaborating with experts within this space and giving them a platform in order to springboard into various roles here in Decentraland, and within the Web3 realm. Blockchain Social aims to provide an opportunity to equip women entrepreneurs with tools and connections to flourish within this space.\n\nDCL Content & Team Analytics:\n\n*   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZTIPxtC7TvLf3PWO2SeWBK6ULoW2BV2L?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMonthly Deliverables:\n\n*   20 engaging posts across multiple social media platforms at minimum\n*   10 quality videos highlighting Decentraland at minimum\n*   30 Instagram Stories featuring Decentraland at minimum\n*   4 Blog posts (400 word minimum) capturing the unique world of Decentraland\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Decentraland Studios — Grant Renewal",
    "body": "> by 0x9942c18de1b386d77828f79e4ebe4ed60bcd3fce (Crespi)\n\nShould the following $34,620 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe are seeking a grant renewal for Decentraland Studios. Our mission is to create job opportunities for Decentraland creators by developing and maintaining [Decentraland Studios](https://studios.decentraland.org/), a platform where creators can showcase their skills and apply for commercial projects exclusively available to them. You can check our previous grant proposals [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=81af5b00-02e6-11ed-8f44-ef1722f0509f) (July 2022) and [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=81283aa0-b946-11ed-95dc-afd12ca00986) (March 2023) to read our latest updates.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n34,620 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x256874B9FD26cBf11a4E2DE5CFFE5a877603044d\n\n## Email address\n\nstudios@decentraland.org\n\n## Description\n\nThis initiative will keep Decentraland Studios running and enhance the user experience for our community and brands looking to bring their vision to Decentraland. During our last grant, we launched the Jobs feature, which listed 14+ new commercial projects for our community, and drove 20.000+ unique visitors to our platform.\n\nFor this grant, our main goals are:\n\n**1. Maintain platform operations:**\n\nWe will ensure a smooth operation by addressing user inquiries, onboarding new studios, and staying connected with Decentraland's ecosystem. This includes but is not limited to overseeing [studios.decentraland.org](http://studios.decentraland.org/), Discord, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dcl_studios), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/decentraland_studios/), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/decentraland-studios).\n\n**2. Enhance User Experience:**\n\n2.1 Improvements to [Jobs](https://studios.decentraland.org/) feature:\nNowadays, brands (aka “customers” in this proposal) are unable to see their projects after they post them to our platform. Also, communication between studios and brands happens exclusively via email. Even though our MVP was intended to work like this, we are aware of its limitations:\n\n*   Brands can’t directly manage their projects, especially if they post more than one project simultaneously\n*   Brands have a hard time tracking their communication with each studio that offers to collaborate with them\n\nBecause of this, we will develop a dashboard for potential clients to monitor and manage the job opportunities they create and a messaging system that will facilitate communication between studios and brands. These two features will allow brands to easily manage and keep track of their project's status. By improving the brands’ experience in our platform we are looking to make them returning users, thus growing the number of job opportunities for studios.\n\n2.2 Improvements to [resources](https://studios.decentraland.org/resources), [projects](https://studios.decentraland.org/projects) and [studio profiles](https://studios.decentraland.org/profile/amaixin)\n\nWe will improve the UI for Resources making them easier to understand before opening them on GitHub. We will add filter and sorting functionalities to the projects view, allowing users to find projects that are relevant to them. We will also improve the studios' profiles to better showcase their skills and talent. This includes adding a messaging system so that users can contact studios easily.\n\n**3. Generate leads:**\n\nCreate performance marketing campaigns in web2 platforms such as Linkedin, Twitter, Google, and Instagram targeted to brand owners and marketers interested in building a presence in the Metaverse. We are not requesting a budget for this task, as we still have a ~15.000 DAI surplus from our previous grant which we will use for the same purpose.\n\n**4. Discover market needs:**\n\nBy accurately addressing brands’ pain points and needs, we anticipate more job opportunities for Decentraland creators. To accomplish this, we propose a brief product discovery and user research cycle, involving interviews with brands. This research will provide valuable insights into their preferences, challenges, and desired features, shaping our future development decisions and feature enhancements.\n\nCheck the financial report of our previous grant [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qMSZtMVFNOfcTCc_QGD6YNmmiHIOjh21bCIEwXVIK48).\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Continuous tasks:**\n\n*   Moderate job posts, onboard new studios, maintain social media channels, and engage with our community and potential customers.\n\n**Month 1:**\n\n*   Design a login and dashboard for brands. Design a messaging system for each project to facilitate communication between studios and brands. Introduce filtering and sorting options for projects.\n*   Begin development on the login interface and dashboard. Enhance search capabilities for improved user experience. Optimize the performance of the resources section.\n\n**Month 2:**\n\n*   Update studios' profiles to showcase their work and capabilities more effectively. Design a messaging system for each studio profile. Design an automated email system for efficient surveying and communication with studios and brands. Enhance the resources detail page to create a more informative experience. Initiate product discovery activities.\n*   Launch the login interface and dashboard features. Develop messaging system. Implement updates to studios' profiles.\n\n**Month 3:**\n\n*   Conduct product discovery activities, including interviews and analysis. Present the results of product discovery to the community. Design automated reports of new job listings.\n*   Deploy messaging system. Implement automated polls to gather data about job listings and user preferences. Create automated reports of new job listings for studios. Enhance the display and details page for resources.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

I came to Decentraland in the beginning of 2021, at that time I co-ran an independent outsource art studio for 6 years and had worked with traditional game studios, creative agencies and large clients in web2.\n\n**HISTORY:**\n\nMy first 3D professional job was at the age of 18 and it was for a digital marketing agency working for shopping television deadlines. After a hectic introduction to the 3D art world and working on product launches like Dre Beats back in 2009, I wanted to get back to my passions and went to university to study game art. During the 2nd year of studies I managed to secure a position as an art intern in a game studio working on launch titles for the Xbox One/PS4.\n\nThis isn't a long way of saying I'm old (lol), but I've grown with the technical requirements of an artist over the years and it has left me with a great repetoire of techniques that I've used since making content for Decentraland in order to get, what my business partner and myself deem, the best results with DCL shaders and technical specifications for wearables and for our clients.\n\nWe have had the pleasure of creating assets for the following brands/clients in web3 over the last 2 years;\n\n*   D-Cave\n*   Diesel\n*   Ben Bridge\n*   Kraken\n*   Verse Digital\n*   Deadmau5\n*   Australian Open\n*   Bulova\n*   BBC\n*   Adidas\n*   The Vogu Collective\n*   ANIMO Industries\n*   JustHype UK\n\n**PROPOSAL:**\n\nWe are proposing to create a tutorial series unlike others before, this won't be a 'beginner's tutorial series' however it will be accessible to wearable artists at all skill levels and information will be easily digestible for every step of the process.\n\nThere will be 3 main categories of tutorial videos;\n\n*   **Concept to Completion**\n    *   How to take a concept from a client, hired artist or even an AI generation and break it down technically to prepare for high resolution mesh production.\n    *   How to prepare a high resolution mesh with specific rules to follow that will help the aesthetic finish of your final asset.\n    *   How to retopologise a low poly mesh (ingame ready) with both deformation of animation and texture finish (Unwrapping) in mind.\n    *   How to unwrap the low poly mesh with specific requirements in mind.\n    *   How to bake high poly to low poly with clean results and the correct texture map outputs required for further texture finish.\n    *   How to use the generated maps to create a texture base that is applicable for DCL shaders (Unlit, toon shader).\n    *   How to use everything generated before in the process so that it can be applied to other metaverse platforms (Interopability).\n    *   How to use the assets previously generated to render a clean thumbnail for various marketplaces.\n\n*   **Source Asset to Completion**\n    *   How to take a source asset from a client and make it DCL/Metaverse ready.\n    *   This will repeat the steps above but with client branding fidelity taken into account.\n\n*   **Special Case Techniques**\n    *   A variety of videos showing off crazy and fun techniques (Fur, Deformation weighting fun etc...)\n\nThe purpose of this is to share the blueprint of our successful run and so that when a big brand comes knocking aspiring teams in this arena will have the confidence to follow through. It will also help independent community brands!\n\nExamples of style:\n\n[Golden Snubnose Chungus](https://tinyurl.com/dxw3y2x5)\n\n[Ben Bridge Mascot](https://tinyurl.com/bdcmnkmu)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe still have two on-going contracts with clients but if the grant is approved we will be able to record the process of the different tutorial sections and delegate the video editing to our newly hired social media video editor Francis.\n\nWe'll aim for the following;\n\n*   Concept to Completion series - Aug 14th\n*   Source Asset to Completion series -  Aug 30th\n*   Special Case Techniques - September 10th\n\nHowever we'll keep everyone updated as we go and will happily ask questions post milestone releases.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should the DAO Reward Genesis City Scenes That Drive Engagement?",
    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\nThe Decentraland platform emphasizes user-generated content, such as wearables and scenes. This high-quality content is what attracts and retains users, stimulates the marketplace, and ultimately increases revenue for the DAO. Therefore, it's crucial that the DAO incentivizes the creation of exceptional content to maintain this cycle.\n\nCurrently, the DAO operates a grant program to stimulate the development of in-world experiences. Beyond this initial support, however, there are no direct incentives for creators to continue enhancing their scenes. Scene creators often monetize their creations through methods such as selling NFTs, issuing their own tokens, renting space to third parties, or selling the scene code for others to deploy on their land.\n\nA critical question for game developers arises: Why should they build their game on Decentraland instead of other platforms or distribution channels? Besides the project's strong values and initial financial support, there seems to be a long-term economic benefit that has not been fully defined yet.\n\nThis proposal suggests a distribution of MANA to scene creators based on the number of users their scenes attract. The user addresses and their locations are publicly available information, disclosed by the protocol and accessible via [DCL Metrics](https://dcl-metrics.com/scenes) and [Atlas Corporation](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=66d76070-0d27-11ed-92a2-218eab5ea42b). The Decentraland Foundation also maintains a record of this data.\n\nThere are, however, numerous questions about how such a distribution should operate, particularly concerning its vulnerability to hacking or bot attacks. The purpose of this proposal is to gather community sentiment on the idea and to start discussions about how to design such a system.\n\nThe Decentraland Foundation could initiate a pilot program, taking responsibility for calculating the winners, filtering bots, and distributing MANA as compensation to creators. Subsequently, any community member could request a grant to keep this program operational.\n\n### Questions & Proposed Answers:\n\n**What scenes participate in the engagement contest?**\\\nAll scenes in Genesis City can participate in the contest, excluding plazas and roads.\n\n**How much MANA should be distributed?**\\\nThe amount should be adjusted based on the revenue generated by the DAO from marketplace fees. For instance, over the last 30 days, there was an income of 30k USD.\n\n**How should the MANA be distributed among the scene creators?**\\\nPrizes should be distributed monthly. All scenes will be ranked by an engagement metric using data from the past 30 days. The top 20 scenes receive a part of the prize based on the following scheme:\n\n*   Top 1: 25% = $7,500\n*   Top 2: 15% = $4,500\n*   Top 3: 10% = $3,000\n*   Top 4 to 10: 4% = $1,285\n*   Top 11 to 20: 2% = $600\n\n*The total prize is based on a 30k USD amount.*\n\n**How is the engagement of a scene measured?**\\\nSeveral metrics should be defined to strengthen the algorithm. The key metrics will be calculated using public traffic data reported by the catalyst nodes. The proposed metrics include:\n\n*   AVG DAILY UNIQUE WEB3 VISITORS: Number of unique web3 visitors for the month divided by the days of the month.\n*   AVG DAILY WEB3 VISITS: Number of times web3 users have entered the scene within the month divided by the days of the month.\n*   AVG SCENE RETENTION: The average of days passed between the first and last appearance of a web3 user in a scene within the month for all web3 users that visited the scene more than once in that month.\n*   AVG RETURNING: Average number of times a web3 user visits the same scene within the month.\n*   AVG STAY MINS: Average time spent by web3 users in the scene, in minutes.\n\n*All metrics are calculated over web3 users (non-guest users).*\n\n**How is a ranking produced based on the key engagement metrics?**\\\nThe process involves creating five different scene rankings, one for each key metric. These rankings are then combined using [Borda’s count method](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/waymakermath4libarts/chapter/borda-count/) using the formula:\n\n*scene_score = value(position_ranking\\_1) + … + value(position_ranking\\_5)*\n\nThe value of each position in the rankings is calculated using numbers derived from different percentiles of a normal distribution. This method ensures that ranking in the top positions is more rewarding.\n\n**What does this ranking look like for June engagement metrics?**\\\n![winners_june](https://yemel.github.io/dao-images/winers_june.png)\n\nYou can find the dataset with the example at [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cjj1qyT7fLOzOCyAzLAh4uVGabB7qkjQRD0F6nD6Esk/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n**How are bots prevented from manipulating the ranking?**\\\nTo prevent fraudulent activity in the engagement metrics, the Decentraland Foundation flags and removes from the analysis web3 users who display suspicious activity. This activity is currently flagged based on the number of sessions connected from the same IP and user agent. The list of suspicious users can be published along with the dataset for auditing purposes.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Thus, we envisage the continuation of development in BPF, with many new and fresh mechanics that intertwine with existing features. Being a staple in Decentraland (DCL), BPF had more than 30000 unique visitors in the last 90 days and an average of more than 4000 weekly sessions for the last 8 months, and we strive to attract more visitors into DCL and represent DCL on an international scale.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n90,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x017fBaDCA2Dbc267Bb046624F23831662A6Fd718\n\n## Email address\n\nbutterflyprawnfarm@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe Butterfly Prawn Farm (BPF) is a F2P, P2E farm game that aims to create an easy-to-play Metaverse game in Decentraland (DCL) for the whole community. BPF's goal is to continuously boost and engage the community in DCL. With a delivered Minimum Viable Product (MVP), BPF aims to push the boundaries, building onto fresh and advanced features, catering to farmers (aka players) with months of mileage. Similarly, BPF continues to attract new farmers through the next phase of development (details in the Dropbox link).\n\nThis baseline game product currently allows the farmers to harvest crops, catch farm animals, perform crafting, ascend the Magic Beanstalk, and scout the Cloud Castle. Being one of the top P2E games in DCL, BPF also offers multiple activities and events with wearable/emote rewards. Furthermore, BPF has also been known to be setting standards on compliance, and introducing new and innovative wearable/emote utilities in DCL.\n\nCurrently, with high traction, the game quickly propelled seasoned/advanced farmers toward the end of the game. As a result, the team seeks to adhere to the level of dedication and motivation to continue developing advanced features for seasoned farmers. The team is also planning to develop new features to engage new farmers and provide seasoned farmers with more activities within the farm. With the drive to further BPF’s cause to the community and DCL, the team would like to seek funding from the community in this expansion plan. The team also strongly believes that the funding and support will value-add, boost, retain, and engage the community.\n\nThe team consists of 7 team members with a vast set of skills and experience. Our collaborative experiences include full-stack (frontend & backend) software development and deployment, product management, 2D/3D product design, and operations support.\n\nExperience aside, we are a group of game enthusiasts. Passionate and inspired by the Metaverse, we have been actively developing and deploying new features in BPF frequently while tapping into our expertise. We always aim to serve and attract the DCL community better, through one-of-a-kind events, gameplay, and wearables!\n\nOur team believes in delivering only the best for DCL community. As we tap into our expertise, the team applies agile development (SCRUM), where we have meetings (daily stand-up and fortnightly sprints) to be kept abreast of development progress, design updates, ideation, and retrospectives.\n\nCollaboration:\nApart from developing BPF, the team believes in doing what is best for the DCL community as well. Because of this, we actively foster collaboration and compliance. Below is a list of projects/community we collaborated and engaged in during the last grant.\n\n1.  Curation station library 2 Meta GamiMall\n2.  Meta Residence Tower\n3.  Decentraland Blog Post, written by Yurius, the product manager\n4.  Project management monthly meeting with video demonstration and metrics to the Grant Support Squad for compliance\n5.  Monthly reports for compliance\n\nDropbox Link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zmlz0a4pji2tmxm/AAA8nUzmPQvs6\\_uDn3SPd3hDa?dl=0\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nPhase 1:\n\n1.  Cloud Castle Expansion\n2.  New plots and plants with new utility\n3.  Plot logic and new materials\n4.  Harvest and fertilizer logic\n\nPhase 2:\n\n1.  Animal farm (Rearing of farm animals with produce)\n2.  Development of animals design/logic\n3.  Purchases and frontend design/logic\n4.  Backend design/logic\n5.  Produce and expiry logic\n6.  Passive effects\n\nOngoing development through 6 months:\n\n1.  Marketplace trading\n2.  Overall gameplay and server improvements\n3.  New wearables\n4.  3 events and rewards\n5.  Sustainability\n6.  Cybersecurity improvements\n7.  Technical debts and bug fixes\n\nSustainability\n\n1.  Selling of wearables and emotes on DCL Marketplace. Current sales amount to more than $MANA 7500. With an aggressive approach for wearables and emotes sales, it would fund day-to-day operations. The team is mindful to balance ALL wearables and emotes in-game bonuses to continue to attract the secondary market, benefiting from BPF\n2.  Launch of rare/supply-controlled wearables (higher bonuses to games) - More mythic tier wearables to command competitive prices for sustainability\n3.  Sales of in-game currency in BPF Marketplace (in $MANA) - Purchase of BP Coins to purchase in-game commodities from shop/farmers\n4.  Collaboration - Working with other artists, DCL content providers to share costs on design, curator fees and advertising\n5.  Gachapon - Sustainence of the game (implemented)\n6.  Content pass - For farmers who paid for extra content and materials (plots, coins, exp, etc) (upcoming)\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Our events are unique since they include different sports like Running, Muay Thai, Surfing, Football, etc. We have been organising events in Hong Kong and our groups are only growing every time.\n\n**Why sports**\n\nNothing bonds communities better than sports. We see it in both professional and amateur sports. Sports not only give a feeling of belonging but also promote a healthier lifestyle while forming meaningful connections in a less stressful environment, foster stronger relationships, build trust and improve mental health, productivity, overall health and well-being.\n\nOur events are also less overwhelming as an entry point for people interested in Web3 than the usual, more formal events and we are seeing almost 50% of attendees being their first ever Web3 event they attend.\n\n**Why Hong Kong**\n\nThe Hong Kong government has recently legalised cryptocurrency retail trading, which added to the low tax, the strong financial system and the lifestyle of the city, makes Hong Kong a prime spot to rapidly grow its numbers of builders. The proximity of China and their huge Web3 community is another point to have in mind and a migration of builders from mainland China to Hong Kong is already happening. We can expect Hong Kong to become one of the most important Web3 hubs in the world in a short period of time.\n\n**How does Decentraland benefit**\n\nBy becoming the sponsors of these events Decentraland will achieve a unique position in a very young, rapidly growing Web3 community in Hong Kong. Our events are also perfectly positioned to welcome newcomers to Hong Kong since they are very casual and a great way to not only learn about Decentraland but to meet other Web3 folks and rapidly become part of the community.\n\nOur events always end up with what they call in Rugby \"third half\". After our activities there is time to chat, meet the others and present the projects that have sponsored us. This \"third half\" can last from 1.5 hours to a whole day hence reinforcing the ties between the participants and making them a lot more responsive to project presentations.\n\nThe Chinese Web3 community is specially interested in NFT and Metaverse projects which align perfectly with Decentraland's views.\n\nA showcase of our past events can be seen in our website: https://hkweb3sports.com\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur intention is to organise a meet up every 3 weeks approximately.\n\nThe grant will help us fund events for the next 4 months or 5 events.\n\nWe expect to reach 100 attendees per event in the next 2 months.\n\nMilestones:\n\n*   August -> Successfully organise and execute a 'Surfing the Web3' event with an introduction to surf delivered by professional coaches, drinks, a barbeque and a presentation of Decentraland. Expected attendees: 50\n\n*   End of August/Beginning of September -> Successfully organise and execute a 'Bubble Football' event with drinks, dinner, DJ and a showcase of what the attendees from the previous event have built on Decentraland. Expected attendees: 70\n\n*   End of September -> Successfully organise and execute a 'Paintball' event including drinks, food and showcasing how Decentraland can help the existing projects the attendees already have built. Expected attendees: 100\n\n*   The rest of the events are yet to be organised depending on various factors like weather conditions, venues availability and our own community preferences.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

After discussions with GSS, we decided to re-propose it under the correct category.\nOur focus is to keep the onboarding and marketing focused on Decentraland, offering users precise explanations, translations of all tools, updates, and platform functionalities, as well as training and humanized support. In this way, we seek to promote growth and create opportunities for all platform users, facilitating access and encouraging the creation of new communities in other countries. Our goal is to make the platform inclusive and accessible through education ,also  to create a strong source of Decentraland-related social media content for both english-speaking and brazilian/portuguese .\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n36,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x3429CbFf7EB34e4C9dD9D7E41041fd7b2a01FdB0\n\n## Email address\n\natrovenado@decentralandbrasil.com\n\n## Description\n\nIn this concession proposal, the Decentraland Brazil community team, also known as “DCL Brasil,” requests support to ensure the continuity and improvement of inclusion projects, training with humanized support, and essential maintenance of the community. For more than a year, we have been committed to publicizing and expanding the platform in the country. During this period, our team and projects were financed exclusively with funds from the Founder’s personal budget, without ever resorting to any funds from the DAO.\nSince the beginning, our main objective has been to educate and generate opportunities for all. We seek to attract new users, brands, and creators to Web3 to foster the growth and expansion of the platform. We support and launch new community talent, offering resources and guidance to help them achieve their creative goals. In addition, we encourage training for new creators, SDKs, and modelers, creating help groups where more experienced individuals offer support and guidance to beginners, sharing their knowledge and skills to help others grow and develop.\n\nAs the community grows and evolves, new talent is discovered and supported in their creative journeys. Through carefully planned actions and opportunities, the community is turning dreams into reality and cultivating a vibrant culture of creativity and innovation. Because we believe that everyone has unique skills and talents that deserve to be valued and supported, we work to promote actions that generate personalized opportunities for each individual, according to their skills and interests.\nDuring this period, the team’s salary and the community’s projects were financed solely by the Founder’s personal budget. Some initiatives were taken, such as the purchase of land that today houses the headquarters of DCL Brazil, whose coordinates are (-107, -94). In addition, a community T-shirt was published, with free distribution to all members and interested parties.\nTwelve wearables were also created in collaboration with other members of the platform. We also acquired seven Decentraland names.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1ezulF2ulYT7wbFrBNzda81yNFFDuQ8n4KPmr-KlS06Y/edit\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nhttps://www.notion.so/c826703fff054c4688ebb0a013a4d5b0?v=fcdc3504ec3541f7924dce0b749ca44d\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

With around 20,000 active monthly users on Decentraland, less than 1% currently engage in DAO governance activities. This grant aims to create content that encourages greater participation in governance, thereby fostering a more engaged community.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n45,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n12 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x153B2252EDdcB3690aE6F5E9f38be13779E1364D\n\n## Email address\n\njar0d.eth@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nTo achieve the goal of increasing the current Decentraland communities' governance participation, the grant project will focus on two primary areas of content creation:\n\nDAO News - \"The Medicine\": Regular weekly recaps highlighting active grants and proposals while tracking their progress. These recaps will also report on the successful proposals that have passed, fostering transparency and awareness of ongoing governance efforts. Additionally, upcoming DAO events will be actively promoted to encourage greater participation from the community.\n\nCommunity Celebration - \"The Sugar\": In-depth creator and project spotlights will be produced, delving into the talented artists and communities that contribute to the vibrancy of Decentraland.

These recaps will provide an overview of the events and their impact. An example of an event recap can be found at: \\[https://www.playdcl.games/post/mental-health-action-day].\n\nAlong with this content, I want to explore more List style content like Top 5 and Top 10 rankings. While lists are reductive and subjective, people love them. I believe that the content can be created and presented in a way that makes it clear the list is for fun and does not hurt any ones feelings while also increasing the virality of the content. I think the List style rankings will be a very effective way of making the community aware of individuals they might not otherwise be aware of.\n\nI would publish this content on playDCL.games and allow anyone within the community the right to use the content, with credit, of course.\n\nAlong with the written content, I have a proven track record of being able to generate engagement within the Decentraland community and am directly responsible for a number of DCL community members having joined the DCL DAO Discord.\n\nAs a member of most Decentraland Community Discords and as someone who has helped many in the community promote events for their project, I am in an excellent position to promote the DAO to the community on a grass-roots level.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWeekly Deliverables\nShort Form News Articles \\[400~ words each]: Two a week\nFeatures \\[2000~ words]: One a week\nWords: 2800~\nAttend weekly Community Twitter Spaces to inform people about, and encourage them to check out, what the DAO is doing.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Default REALM and SOLO Mode Implementation",
    "body": "> by 0xb8782cf628357ce2751a4ea3007934048fbaa672\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Default REALM and SOLO Mode Implementation](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=42e4c480-199e-11ee-93a7-ed9294f83f74)\n\n## Summary\n\nProposal with implementation details for how the default realm and solo mode will be implemented.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe social engagement of the platform is hindered by the complexity of navigating realms, coordinating locations, and connecting with friends. This has led to the suggestion of implementing a default realm to better connect users, while also offering the option for a solo mode to explore the world individually. As a result, this enhancement will simplify the process of connecting with others in Genesis City, while also providing individuals the option to enjoy scenes without being overwhelmed by a flood of users or chat messages.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThrough several user interviews, a common sentiment expressed was that the metaverse tends to feel lonely and isolated, with users experiencing difficulties in meeting communities or friends. Furthermore, press releases from high-profile events have brought to attention some situations where they found themselves in realms with a low user base and reported low participation in their news when, in fact, they just ended up in a realm with a low user count. These situations highlight the impact of users being dispersed among separated realms by default. On the other hand, there are some experienced platform users that like the fact of having realms to jump to an empty server and be able to explore a scene by themselves without being flooded by avatars or chat messages and this could be easily managed from the UI without needing to jump to a different realm.\n\nThis fueled the idea of having a default realm, when users enter the platform, they will be directed to a default realm where all users are initially placed together. Once a user is in the default realm, they will have the flexibility to choose between either moving to a different realm or activating the solo mode to explore the world in isolation. These actions could be initiated at any time.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe upcoming section discusses the technical details of the necessary changes. Let's start with an overview of the current design. Each Catalyst node includes a comms service that enables real-time messaging between players. However, this design has drawbacks:\n\n*   Users can only interact with others using the same comms service instance. Even if two users are in the same scene, but connected to different comms services, they cannot see or interact with each other.\n*   Scalability is limited because a Catalyst node runs all services on the same computer. These services compete for hardware resources, imposing a constraint on the number of open connections a comms service can handle. As a result, there is a maximum limit on the number of users a realm can effectively manage. If the limit is reached, new users cannot join until more resources are available.\n\nThe proposed solution involves each Catalyst node registering an external comms service to replace the internal one. By doing this, the hardware resources initially allocated to the internal comms service can be freed up and used by other services. This allows different node operators to share a comms service but it should be noted that the service won't be composed of a single computer or process and it will be a set of scalable microservices, ensuring efficient resource utilization and accommodating the growing user load.\n\nSetting up a custom comms service will be as straightforward as running a Catalyst bundle of services. This will empower anyone to easily spin up their own comms without complexity or technical hurdles.\n\nUsers will establish a connection to the default comms service when logging into Decentraland, similar to how they connect to a Matrix server for chat. The purpose of this comms service is to facilitate user interaction and handle their positions, regardless of which Catalyst node they use to download scenes.\n\nCatalyst owners have the flexibility to configure their nodes to utilize either the default comms service or deploy their own using the provided bundle. This choice can be modified as needed, granting them control over the comms service employed. As a consequence, the existing mechanism for changing realms will remain intact, although the number of realms may decrease due to multiple nodes sharing the same comms service. Nevertheless, users will still enjoy the freedom to switch between realms, ensuring that no one is limited to the default realm.\n\nIn solo mode, users can disconnect from the comms service, disabling interactions with others. They won't have access to voice chat or nearby chat channels. Solo mode allows users to explore the virtual world without engaging with others.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe new model is expected to have a significant impact on platform engagement and scalability.\nThe scalability of the system will improve as hardware resources can be allocated horizontally as needed to accommodate the growing user load. The flexibility given to Catalyst owners to choose between the default comms service and their own deployment empowers them to tailor their nodes to specific needs and preferences. Overall, these changes will enhance user experiences, promote social connections, provide greater control over interactions, and ensure that the default realm is not limiting.\n\n#### Catalyst endpoints update:\n\nBy moving the comms service from the Catalyst node to a new service, the endpoints responsible for reporting islands and users will also be moved accordingly. Catalyst nodes will expose the URL of the comms service they are utilizing, which will, in turn, provide the same endpoints and functionalities as they currently do. This ensures continuity in the availability and accessibility of information. Below you can see a high-level description of the changes needed:\n/about: comms object will change to expose the comms service registered by the Catalyst node\n/explore/realms: will change its content, showing the list of Catalysts and their names but the comms information will be moved to the new service\n\nThe following endpoints will be exposed by the new comms service:\n\n/comms/islands\n/comms/islands/{islandId}\n/comms/peers\n/explore/hot-scenes\n\nThe Catalyst monitor will feature new representations for registered comms services, with the user count and comms date moved to these boxes.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nCreate the Comms Service Bundle: Develop and package the necessary components for the realm, including:\n\n*   A microservice for handling WebSocket connections.\n*   A stats service for exposing comms metrics.\n*   An archipelago service for calculating the islands.\n*   Utilize NATS as the communication system between services.\n\nDocument the ADR and API Specification: outlining the design and rationale of the Comms service bundle in an architecture decision record and document/publish the API specifications.\n\nAdd a Feature Flag in the client to target the Default Realm:\n\n*   Implement a feature flag mechanism in the client application to gradually roll out the Default Realm functionality.\n*   Enable disaster recovery capabilities in case of failures to switch back to the previous model.\n\nCreate a new Catalyst owner bundle version:\n\n*   Remove the existing comms service.\n*   Add the ability to register an external comms through an environment variable.\n*   Update the affected API endpoints and API specification\n*   Implement solo mode in the client, allowing users to appear offline and disconnect from the rest of the users.\n\nRun stress tests with users in a staging environment:\n\n*   Evaluate functionality, performance, scalability, and identify potential bottlenecks.\n*   Conduct tests with real users\n\nAdd the new comms service to the Catalyst monitor and update the comms information display.\n\nGradual rollout:\n\n*   Enable the external comms service bundle in a subset of Catalysts nodes\n*   Monitor the system closely during the rollout to identify and address any issues or performance concerns.\n*   Collect feedback from users and iterate as necessary.\n\nMake the stable comms bundle available for use:\n\n*   Ensure the stable version of the comms bundle is accessible and documented for anyone to utilize. Send the communications to the different community channels.\n\nMake the Default comms service available to be registered by any DAO-approved Catalyst node:\n\n*   DAO-approved Catalyst nodes will have the option to use the provided infrastructure or run and use their own instance of the comms service bundle.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe implementation of the default realm and solo mode has a significant impact on the platform and its users. Here are the key outcomes:\n\n*   Enhanced Social Engagement: By introducing a default realm where users are initially placed together, the platform promotes a stronger sense of community and facilitates easier connections among users.\n*   Flexibility for Personal Exploration: The addition of the solo mode provides users with the freedom to explore the world by themselves.\n*   Enhanced User Experience: With a default realm, users no longer have to navigate multiple realms to meet with friends, reducing confusion and complexity.\n*   Maintains the platform's decentralization by allowing any node operator to run their own comms service.\n*   Simpler and More Accurate Hot-Scenes Calculation: Currently each Catalyst node must gather communication information from all nodes in the network and perform its own hot-scenes calculations, resulting in potential delays and slight variations in the data across realms. The default-realm model reduces the number of necessary requests and increases the accuracy and consistency of real-time data.\n*   More scalable solution: current implementation hosts all services on a single computer, the Catalyst node, imposing a physical constraint on the number of open connections that a single comms service can handle. By adopting this approach, it becomes feasible to scale the communication service by adding additional computers to support more users under the same realm.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Review of Delegate's VP issued by Esteban Ordano",
    "body": "> by 0x8218a2445679e38f358e42f88fe2125c98440d59 (1010)\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to highlight that the purpose of this review is not to pass any unfavorable judgment on the individuals who have been delegated VP from EO (Esteban Ordano). It is crucial to recognize that the vast majority, if not all, of the delegates have actively engaged in the DAO, demonstrating their commitment to community building with constructive feedback and comments on various proposals, irrespective of the final outcomes. Their valuable contributions have greatly enhanced the discourse within the community.\n\nThe purpose of this review is to reflect the sentiment within the community regarding the VP delegation from EO, aiming to bring forth any concerns or differences that may exist.\n\nIt has been approximately 6 months since the delegation took place, during which each delegate was granted 500k VP. However, it is worth considering that due to the significant amount of VP held by each individual, they wield considerable influence over the outcome of proposed initiatives. Consequently, the decision-making process tends to be dominated by the **top five to ten voters**, often overshadowing the voices of smaller stakeholders who have invested their own funds into MANA, LAND, NAME and Wearables and actively participate in the DAO. This can lead to a sense of disenfranchisement among community members.\n\nWith that in mind, I would like to propose that EO considers redistributing his VP to a larger pool of delegates, expanding the number from 8 to 16 or more. Over the past 6 months, numerous applications have been submitted by deserving individuals who should be given the opportunity to exert greater influence in the voting process for proposals.\n\nFurthermore, I suggest that delegates who benefit from EO's delegation **ABSTAIN** from voting but are allowed to provide comments.\n\nI kindly request both the community and EO to also take into account the number of votes in favor or against a proposal, rather than solely focusing on the total VP attached to each option. This approach would ensure that every participant has an equal voice in this matter, taking into consideration that automated voting bots may also be present.\n\nIn conclusion, the objective of this review is to foster open discussion and promote a fair and inclusive decision-making process within the community.\n\n- Yes, please review the number of delegates/amount of VP\n- No, leave it as is\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "1% Strategic Diversification of DCL DAO Holdings",
    "body": "> by 0xd6e62a97a55537cd04847bb73e22208bd20106aa (DCLCurations)\n\n**Abstract:**\nDecentraland is the oldest, and one of the most prominent metaverse platforms in the world. With a 10yr, 220M MANA vesting contract, the DAO is able to support a multi-million dollar grants program and multiple DAO teams including: DAO Committee, DAO Governance Squad, Grant Support Squad, Revocations Committee, Facilitations Committee, Moderators, and more.\n\nYet, with a current treasury value of $22,308,022 US Dollar value (98% held in $MANA), there is no finance committee and very little interest in financial management.\n\nThis is intended to persuade the Decentraland Community that diversification is a necessity in order to manage risk, explore growth opportunities, and achieve long-term sustainability that does not rely on the 10yr vesting contract.\n\n**DAO Financial Guiding Principles:**\n\n1.  Maintain Grant Fund sustainability quarter-over-quarter in perpetuity\n2.  Invest, where possible, in tangential platforms or cryptocurrencies\n3.  Have negligible impacts to the $MANA market price\n\n**Short-term Goals: 1-3months**\n\n1.  Convince the Decentraland DAO that financial management and planning is a necessity\n2.  Achieve DAO consensus on a 1% diversification plan ($223,080)\n3.  Establish a framework for investing\n\n**Long-term Goals: 2-5yrs**\n\n1.  Become the World’s greatest DAO\n2.  Achieve positive cashflow\n\n**Current State:**\nThe current position of the DAO is to do nothing with the $MANA they hold; however, within the Decentraland DAO 2 topics of discussion are top of mind:\n\n1.  The downtrend of $MANA which decreases the ability for the DAO to operate and fund growth\n\n2.  Competing platforms (Hyperfy, Mona, Spatial, etc.)\n    I argue that 1% ($223,080) of our current treasury can be used as a starting point to 1. Help mitigate risks of external factors bringing down the value of $MANA and 2. Build relationships and integrations with current “competitors”\n\n**Example Scenario:**\nHyperfy has attracted a lot of attention, especially from the DCL community, for its VRMs and ease to build and host events. 1674/9500 hyperfy LAND has been purchased at a price of .09 ETH (~$168USD).\n\nFor $159,201USD, the Decentraland DAO could take a 10% position in hyperfy land. This can be used by the DCL Community to develop cross-platform integrations and can be leveraged to insert the DCL DAO into conversations with other metaverse platforms about forming collaborations moving forward.\n\nThe Additional ~45k USD can be put onto liquidity platforms such as Uniswap to provide more liquidity, earn yield, and provide some market stabilization for individuals looking to invest in our platform.\n\n- Pursue Further\n- Don't do this\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

We currently host 60+ courses in the library, host weekly live events and attract 400-500 users/month.\n\nThis grant will allow us to build on our successes and improve the Virtual Library in 4 core ways:\n\n1.  Increase available courses and improve learning experience\n2.  Expand questlines and gamification of NFTs\n3.  Expand rewards system and available rewards\n4.  Develop Open-Source components for use across DCL\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n110,300 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n8 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x6a8A014De91d50BA053E43bDe0eaf30D41CbB5f7\n\n## Email address\n\nDCLCurations@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nAs we move forward, we are looking to expand upon the Library in 4 core ways:\n\n**1. Grow Available Courses, Course Structure, and Course Providers/Creators**\n\n●\tExpand offerings to over 200 courses by end of grant\n\n●\tDevelop partnerships with Web2 Course Providers to integrate their material into the Virtual Library – we have already begun working with BTA (The Blockchain Training Alliance) and will be providing some of their course material and hosting an event with them at the end of August (blockchaintrainingalliance.com)\n\n●\tRestructure our Course Management System and Library Card to accept categories (e.g. gaming, coding, 3D modeling, promotional)\n\n●\tAllow for likes on videos and course creators\n\n●\tDevelop a formal Course Creator application form on the CurationStation.fun website (Currently in development and can be visited now)\n\n**2. Questlines and Gamification**\n\n●\tDevelop a Battle Arena where users will use NFT wearables to fight and defend the Virtual Library from invaders\n\n●\tGamify current wearable lines, 4 enemy types, and more incentives to learn and upgrade stats\n\n●\tHost on DCL Worlds and connect to the Genesis scene via a Battle Portal\n\n**3. Rewards System**\n\n●\tDevelop a Dynamic NFT Reward Booth which will be able to host multiple NFTs for players to claim in exchange for Intelligence Points\n\n●\tLink the Reward Booth to our Administrative Tool so that new collaborations and NFTs can easily be added and priced (in IP) to the game and keep the rewards fresh to incentivize users to learn\n\n●\tDevelop 4 new wearable sets (The Invaders) that people can gain by completing courses, earning Intelligence Points and participating in the new game mode\n\n**4. Opensource Book Booth**\n\n●\tDevelop an opensource Book Booth that will hold a subset of library courses and be deployable across Decentraland\n\n●\tWhile this won’t be linked to our game mechanics, the goal is to allow others to use, and build upon, the course offerings on their own land and find unique ways that they can gamify the education in the context of their own experiences\n\n●\tThe opensource nature of the Book Booth will also allow them to act as Way Points across Decentraland when DCL Questing is re-released\n\n**Additional Improvements**\n\n●\tDevelop The Curator AI NPC and AI website chatbot to help manage content and help users. We will also provide the community with clear documentation and videos walking them through how to implement AI bots in their own scenes and recommendations on how to train them\n\n●\tSDK6 to SDK7 transition: We will be reworking our current code base to SDK7 and will continue our library development using SDK7 in all areas that SDK7 is currently fit to support\n\n●\tMarketing Analysis, Strategy, and Implementation: We will be partnering with Ryan MacDowell (rmac), the founder of Do Well Studio, to deliver a comprehensive 360° Marketing Audit of our current strategies and performance metrics, define our marketing objectives, and create an actionable marketing strategy w/ an automated self-serve marketing system for immediate implementation\n\n●\tCourse Payments: We will pay $100/video to DCL Community members that would like to develop courses for the Library. Courses will be hosted in the Library for free, can be used by the creator on their socials and platforms, and used by the groups they cover as well. As an additional incentive to create courses, we will also use a portion of the budget as prize money to the top Course Creators voted on by the community\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Month 1:**\n\n●\tConduct marketing audit & launch strategic plan\n\n●\tRelease of Web3 Companion Website for Players and Content Creators\n\n●\tCreation of new Player Handbook\n\n●\t8 Thought Leadership articles/month\n\n●\tPlanning for DB, API updates (optimizations, Reward Booth schema, and Book Booth) and SDK7 transition\n\n**Month 2:**\n\n●\tImplementation of Metamask Wallet connect and Curation Station Leaderboards for Web3 Companion Website\n\n●\tImproved CurationStation 3D UI, bug fixes and Player Onboarding / Retention\n\n●\tCourse Management (Admin tool) improvements\n\n●\tAI strategy development\n\n●\tRelease of new marketing strategy\n\n**Month 3-6:**\n\n●\tDevelopment of Battle Arena, reward booth and opensource book booth\n\n●\tDevelopment of new game mechanics\n\n●\tDevelopment of new wearable rewards\n\n●\tAI testing and training\n\n**Month 7:**\n\n●\tBeta testing month - Book Booth, Battle Arena, Chat Bot, Rewards system\n\n**Month 8:**\n\n●\tAlpha release\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Following two rejected grant applications, the scope of the project has been reduced to ensure the delivery of a tool focusing on no-code solutions for DCL creators.\nOur primary goal is to democratize the creation process in DCL by providing a solution that is accessible to all. We aim to empower creators, regardless of their technical skills, to create visually appealing and interactive experiences.\nBy providing a tool that simplifies the creation process, we hope to attract a diverse group of creators to DCL. We believe that by doing so, we can contribute to long term success of DCL.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n40,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n4 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2a9Da28bCbF97A8C008Fd211f5127b860613922D\n\n## Email address\n\ncamilo.echeverri@thedac.info\n\n## Description\n\n**DCL-Edit V3** will focus on the following areas:\n\n*   A Code-Free UI Editor for empowering non-coders in creating visually appealing and interactive UI experiences (the Decentraland foundation is working on enabling developers to create UI using React code, which is great, but which still requires coding skills)\n*   Live Model Update: make changes to models visible in real-time without the need to re-import them or reload the scene, which greatly simplifies and accelerates scene building, especially when working in parallel in a larger team.\n*   Compatibility for different model formats, eliminating the time and effort required for exporting and importing\n\nDCL-Edit V3 will fully support Decentraland SDK7. An update for DCL-Edit V2 to support SDK7 is planned as well.\n\nYou can find the specs for all the planned features [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16cKe1p1H8BeO2EYO0Wq7SwovNYJXHN080xLF5r3IjkE/edit#heading=h.r03xvobexfk5).\n\nDCL-Edit will continue to serve as a cornerstone in the Decentraland development environment, offering features comparable to established game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine. The current V2 has a nice set of features that make it one of the best scene editors currently in the market (see a full feature list [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1\\_FzQiPVecQF7xZxNPLmnQsRk2zhdbFXz4d1Eif3mgX4/edit)).\n\nAdditionally, contributions beyond DCL-Edit will continue to be executed, including \"Builder of the Month\", bi-weekly coding sessions, and tutorial sessions for creating games in Decentraland. The goal is to foster an attractive environment for expert developers.\n\nThe importance of having an editor capable of accommodating professionals and more importantly non-coders cannot be overstated. It is crucial for gaining traction and attracting a diverse user base to the Decentraland platform. We encourage everyone to support us, we love Decentraland and are convinced that DCL-Edit V3 will take DCL to a whole new level.\n\nIf you have not tried DCL-Edit yet, try it out [here](https://dcl-edit.com/).\n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J\\_8Dus0o-5Y) is a tutorial on how to use it.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nBelow are the planned milestones including the planned intermediate releases for each month.

    "body": "> by 0xd1e95c1802a4e3f29046d2907b6ed8e950ea5a72 (SpottieWiFi)\n\nShould the following $172,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nIntroducing ‘All Time High Festival’ (ATH), a gamified music festival spanning four days/nights in Decentraland, set to disrupt the music industry. ATH aims to elevate digital concerts and onboard new users into DCL.\n\nIn order to attract top-tier talent and establish a new standard for talent buying in the metaverse, the majority (> 50%) of our budget is allocated for the performers and visual artists. ATH team members will receive modest compensation for the considerable hours of labor they will commit to the festival between now and end of year (~1700 hours).\n\n[Watch our proposal video](https://www.alltimehighfest.com/)\n\n[Read our deck](https://www.alltimehighfest.com/deck)\n\n[For more info](https://www.alltimehighfest.com/more-info)\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n172,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x882B76DE0bB6b5b34a9f5A0Fa49dA34C16966c8c\n\n## Email address\n\nspottiewifi@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nAll Time High is a 4-day Metaverse festival that merges music, gaming, technology and education. In the long run, we envision ATH Festival as a self-sustainable, native Decentraland festival that attracts sponsors and popular talent year after year.\n\nOur co-founder and hip hop legend Bun B headlines the festival, which will instantly establish our credibility with mainstream artists and publications. By curating a diverse and cohesive roster of performers, creating a uniquely gamified experience and marketing it through our channels and connections, we aim to create the #1 music festival in the metaverse.\n\nATH’s gamified experience will incentivize participants to engage deeply with the festival through games, prizes, and exclusive experiences with their favorite artists.\n\n**Location:**\nThanks to our team’s resources, we will have access to several venues for our festival:\nDCL Main Stage, LimeWire stage, the GAIAN store, and Spottieland. Having access to DCL’s best venues for free enables us to dedicate more funds to performers, visual artists, and designers.\n\n**Spottieland:**\nSpottieland spans two neighboring estates and is Spottie WiFi’s forthcoming 95-parcel gamified theme park, festival grounds and mall. Spottie acquired the land in June 2023 as a permanent metaverse homebase in Decentraland’s Aetheria District, and Spottieland is currently being designed and built by Mr. Dhingia).\n\n**Gamification:**\nWe will create a gamified experience that spans across our festival grounds and multiple venues. DCL users that attend ATH Fest will be able to collect ATH coins and other coins to unlock free wearables, merch, vinyl records and other prizes. Custom UI will appear while on festival grounds to show how many coins players have collected.\n\n**Community Involvement:**\nAll Time High is committed to delivering an experience that attracts national acts as headliners, while also giving Decentraland musicians a platform to perform for a broader audience.\n\nAt least 15% of the talent budget for music artists will be used to book independent artists nominated by the Decentraland community.\n\nThe festival grounds will include shops for wearables and emotes, and some retail space will be reserved for independent fashion designers nominated by the Decentraland community.\n\n**Education:**\nThroughout the 4-day festival, we will schedule insightful talks and panel discussions with leaders from the Decentraland community, as well as the music and entertainment industry. These conversations\n\n**Project Scope:**\nTo realize our goals, the project scope encompasses the following components:\n\n*   Customizing the Decentraland Main Stage and/or Limewire Stage for the festival (No grant funds will be used to purchase land).\n*   Develop a listen-to-earn game including a dashboard/game interface.\n*   Book talented performers for the festival.\n*   Onboard sponsors to support the festival.\n*   Execute comprehensive marketing and PR campaigns.\n*   Create visually captivating sets for performing musicians.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe ATH team will begin hosting weekly Twitter Spaces (@AllTimeHighFest) beginning Thursday, July 6 at 6:30PM EST, to kickstart conversation with the DCL community. The community will have direct input on music and visual artists that will be booked for the festival, as well as designers of wearables for the four-day event.\n\n**Increase user engagement:**\n\n*   Achieve a minimum of 50,000 unique visitors attending the festival.\n*   Obtain positive feedback and high ratings from attendees through surveys or feedback forms.\n\n**Drive Decentraland awareness and adoption:**\n\n*   Increase new Decentraland user registrations by 30% during the festival period.\n*   Generate at least 1,000,000 impressions or social media posts about Decentraland and the festival using designated hashtags and competitions.\n*   Secure media coverage and features in major publications or media outlets focusing on music, entertainment, and technology.\n\n**Foster partnerships and collaborations:**\n\n*   Establish partnerships with influential music industry artists and brands to perform or participate in the festival.\n*   Develop sponsorship interest and partnerships with corporate sponsors.\n\n**Enhance the festival experience:**\n\n*   Set a new standard for talent booking in the metaverse with fair pay and a diverse line-up.\n*   Incorporate interactive elements and immersive experiences within the festival through gamification.\n    Ensure smooth technical operations with minimal technical issues or downtime during the festival.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

From its inception, it has grown into a fully-featured product development team working in an open and agile way, focused on improving the capabilities of the central governance platform of the Decentraland DAO, the Governance dApp, and its ecosystem.\n\nThis grant will set up a budget for the next 6 months to run this team. This grant could be extended upon a further decision of the DAO if the project succeeds in its objectives. The DAO Governance Squad has been set up as a Panama sole-purpose, Non-for-Profit Foundation. The costs associated with maintaining the foundation are included in this Grant. The same Grant conditions detailed in the [original founding proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ed53e850-5e70-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7) still apply.\n\nTo see the previously shipped initiatives check the previous Grant request proposal [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4772fdb0-74e3-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556).

I am the producer and host of Beyond the NFT a long running weekly live streamed show that focuses on Decentraland Community members and creators, many of them grant-supported. I also am the co founder of Community Building Decentraland discord which is a collective of Decentraland Communities, We also host weekly twitter spaces on Wednesdays at noon. These two projects give me a unique opportunity to explore and share community insights that would be valuable to the Dao Team.  I am passionate about Decentraland and my commitment to the space goes far beyond the 5 hours of technical work per week that this position calls for. Being a member of the DAO committee would be a opportunity for me to  part of something bigger than I am and do my part in contributing to a developing space.\n\n**What is your history with both Decentraland and Decentraland’s DAO?**\n\nI am a Decentraland Streamer , Show host and Community memeber. In the DAO I am an active voter and Grantee.\n\n\n## Evidence\n**What skills, qualifications, and experience will you bring to the committee?**\n\nAs an experienced event coordinator, I have a proven track record of effectively organizing events on Decentraland, which demonstrates my attention to detail and organizational skills.  These skills will assist with administrative tasks such as ensuring that smart contract  lists are up to date and accurate.\n\nAdditionally, my proficiency in public speaking enables me to confidently take the lead on public DAO events and speak at in-person conferences. This skill set is invaluable for engaging with the wider community, promoting the DAO's initiatives, and generating interest and support. Moreover, my experience in Discord moderation equips me with the capability to effectively enforce the rules and maintain a positive and inclusive environment within the Discord server.\n\nI have been actively involved in the crypto space since 2014, which provides me with a deep understanding of the industry and its evolving dynamics. This experience allows me to navigate the intricacies of executing treasury operations, including transfers and fund swaps, with a high level of competence and security awareness. Furthermore, my extensive involvement in the web industry over the past 20 months as a full-time professional has honed my technical skills and problem-solving abilities, making me well-equipped to handle the deployment, funding, and revocation of vesting contracts within the Grants Program.\n\nLastly, my trustworthy reputation is evidenced by being entrusted with VP from 18 wallets. This demonstrates my integrity, reliability, and the confidence others have in my abilities to handle sensitive responsibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, my bilingualism, communication skills, event coordination experience, public speaking abilities, proficiency in Discord moderation, crypto background, and web industry expertise make me an excellent candidate for the position of a member of the DAO Committee.\n\n**Provide links to any relevant social media profiles or other information that will help the community when evaluating candidates.**\n\n*   Twitter: https://twitter.com/SinfulMeatStick\n\n*   Community Building Decentraland Discord link: https://discord.gg/cbdcl\n\n**Application: [https://forum.decentraland.org/t/call-for-candidates-dao-committee/19215/13]()**\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

While acknowledging the capabilities of the current Committee members, I believe I can bring a more open and neutral perspective, along with a different approach to communication with the community and relevant stakeholders. My extensive engagement with every Core Unit of the DAO, several Committees, and multiple teams on the Foundation side provides me with a broader context of the ongoing developments across the board.\n\nAdditionally, I believe there is room for improvement in the speed of enacting on-chain transactions and enhancing transparency in communications when actions are implemented. I am keen to contribute to addressing these areas by introducing human processes and exploring opportunities for automation (that could potentially be implemented as part of the GovSquad roadmap in the future).\n\n**What is your history with both Decentraland and Decentraland’s DAO?**\n\nI have been actively involved in the Decentraland Community since early 2022, leading the Governance Squad.

    "body": "> by 0x521b0fef9cdcf250abaf8e7bc798cbe13fa98692 (Kyllian)\n\nShould Seanny be added to DAO Committee?\n\n## Address\n0xAca8FbbDddfce169114f344D8Ee739Bde665F4f4\n\n## Reasons for adding\n**Why are you applying?**\n\nI feel virtual worlds are often underestimated in their ability to provide an escape to those who struggle to find themselves in their current reality. I am one of those people.\n\nUnlike other virtual environments in which I have lost myself in, Decentraland posed a new opportunity to users which, in my view, is well-aligned with the internet's founding principles; decentralized governance and open source technologies. My background in political science and governance was one of the main reasons I was intrigued by the DAO at the start of my DCL journey; I had long been part of guilds, committees, and working groups (irl and in-game), but the idea of building on-chain infrastructure, which can allow of immutable decision-making systems caught my attention in a way few projects could.\n\nDecentraland changed me in ways few people would expect. Yemel was one of the first people to properly welcome me into Decentraland, offering me his time and focus as I relayed a barrage of questions his way on the state of the DAO. Today, I find myself wanting to give back to DCL, not just by filling a position, but by being bold enough to assess where we can collectively go as a DAO.\n\nYemel's work with external organizations, evaluating risks, and mapping out implementation pathways for the DAO was extremely admirable, and taking on the challenge of filling those big shoes is one of the main reasons why I am humbly submitting my application for the position of DAO Committee member.\n\n**What is your history with both Decentraland and Decentraland’s DAO?**\n\nI've been around Decentraland for around two years now and was lucky enough to broadly expose myself to varying parts of both the space and the community.\n\nA key turning point for me in my Decentraland story was reading the ADRs, in an attempt to deeply understand what it is we're building, what the hurdles ahead may be, and what we should be prioritizing in the present. Since then, I feel I've developed a significantly well-rounded understanding of Decentraland, the DAO, and the core architecture behind DCL, and I do feel this is an opportunity for me to exercise that knowledge in a way that can have a meaningful impact down the road.\n\nIn the past, I've tried, to the best of my ability, to communicate, mediate, bridge-build, and when necessary, provide constructive criticism to fellow community members. Additionally, I feel that in the moments when it was my turn to face criticism, I did my best to actively listen and, where necessary, act on the feedback given to me. You can expect the same attitude and approach from me should I be entrusted with this position.\n\n\n## Evidence\n**What skills, qualifications, and experience will you bring to the committee?**\n\nThe DAO Committee is a position of trust which at a functional level requires a key set of skills related to updating smart contract lists, updating proposal statuses, deploying/revoking vesting contracts, and executing treasury operations, alongside passing reimbursements and compensation fees to specific parties.\n\nI feel my deep familiarity with Decentraland and its systems, alongside my experience co-running a Web3 company will help in expediting my confidence in this role, especially with any tasks/systems I may currently be less familiar with.\n\nHolding a Master of Science in Risk Management and a Bachelor’s degree in European Studies (Political Science) will also be useful, especially when dealing with issues of governance, best practices, risk evaluations, and precedent-setting.\n\nI feel one key contribution I can bring to the committee is related to policy and communication, especially in relation to the Committee’s work with external organizations. I want our DAO to lead lobbying and negotiation efforts related to policies that could potentially affect us, whilst simultaneously starting a serious conversation on how we should address the DAO’s legal recognition as an independent entity.\n\n**Provide links to any relevant social media profiles or other information that will help the community when evaluating candidates.**\n\n(@seanellul on all platforms)\n\n*   https://www.instagram.com/seanellul/\n*   https://twitter.com/seanellul\n*   https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanellul/\n\n***\n\n**Application: [https://forum.decentraland.org/t/call-for-candidates-dao-committee/19215/9]()**\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

After deep conversations with friends, I have written a brief article about the significance of the DAO in the metaverse compared to the real world ([Here](https://medium.com/@rizk\\_57979/in-this-blog-ill-discuss-why-the-decentraland-dao-system-has-the-potential-to-shape-humanity-s-51f793b620b9)).\nWith significant experience in Decentraland as an investor, developer, and observer since 2018/2019, I have actively participated in design and creation. And I think it's time to involve myself more in  governance proposals, DAO operations, and technical aspects, going beyond the artistic work I do, as I believe they complement each other.\n\n**What is your history with both Decentraland and Decentraland’s DAO?**\n\nI have a history with Decentraland that dates back to the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. Initially, I joined Decentraland and started building using the standard DCL builder as an architect. As I progressed, I expanded my knowledge by learning the SDK. During that time, I actively participated in almost all Builder contests held in 2019 & 2020 and was fortunate enough to win several prizes.\n\nAs my involvement with Decentraland grew, it eventually became my full-time occupation. I have constructed over 500 lands, though I must admit that I stopped keeping an exact count. Additionally, I have also created various wearables and emotes. Moreover, I actively engage with the Decentraland community, assisting numerous brands, groups, and companies in their integration into DCL. Some notable collaborations include working with Ytcrackers, RealMissNFT, Goatz NFT, Lottie London, MEW, and most recently, building for Saudi Arabia's largest bank, Riyad Bank ([Here](https://www.metarizk.net/decentraland/)).\nFurthermore, I have been supporting the DAO by holding DCL assets and actively participating in proposal votes, contributing to the decision-making process and the development of Decentraland's ecosystem.\n\n\n## Evidence\n**What skills, qualifications, and experience will you bring to the committee?**\n\n> **Education:**\n\n*   Bachelor's degree in Architecture.\n*   Master's degree in BioDigital Architecture from Barcelona.\n*   Certified Project Management Professional (PMP) from PMI.\n*   Certified Decentraland Studio.\n*   Certified PRO Studio on Sandstorm.\n\n> **Experience:**\n\nWith over 12 years of experience in architecture, I have worked in various countries across the globe. Starting in the Middle East and progressing through Europe, I now find myself in Central America. Currently, my focus is in the metaverse, where I engage in building structures, coding scenes, creating wearables, and designing Emotes.\nIn the cryptocurrency and blockchain field, my journey started in 2017, I have gained extensive knowledge and expertise through various experiences. Continuously expanding my knowledge, I explore and build in different metaverses to understand Decentraland's position compared to our competitors. Notable metaversesI have contributed such as Monaverse, Spatial, tryspace, Tcg world, Eth towers, and I am also a certified PRO Studio on Sandstorm.\n\n> **Honors and Awards:**\n\nI have been honored with more than 10 prizes in the metaverse, with most of them being in the top three positions since 2019. You can find a comprehensive list of my achievements and awards ([Here](https://www.metarizk.net/prizes/)).\n\n**Provide links to any relevant social media profiles or other information that will help the community when evaluating candidates.**\n\n***Website**:*[ www.metarizk.net](https://www.metarizk.net)\n\n***Twitter**:*[ twitter.com/Rizkgh](https://twitter.com/Rizkgh)\n\n***Instagram**:*[ instagram.com/rizk.ghazaly](https://www.instagram.com/rizk.ghazaly/)\n\n***LinkedIn**:*[ linkedin.com/in/rizkghazaly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rizkghazaly666/)\n\n***YouTube**:* youtube.com/@rizkghazaly5294/videos\n\n***Decentraland Studio**:*[ studios.decentraland.org/profile/rizk-ghazaly](https://studios.decentraland.org/profile/rizk-ghazaly)\n\n**Opensea**: https://opensea.io/Rizk-Ghazaly/created\n\n***Interview with Serena where you can know more about my journey**:* [serenaelis.com/post/rizkghazaly](https://www.serenaelis.com/post/rizkghazaly?fbclid=PAAabdMxw9rkrN7PUiBVkVO0xzgOizSjB0jxjUUVXNHOq1LEuDogMIkHgxQRw)\n\n***Prizes**:* https://www.metarizk.net/prizes/\n\n***Article about DCL architecture mentioning one of my buildings:***[ soundoflife.com/blogs/experiences/decentraland-best-architecture-metaverse](https://www.soundoflife.com/blogs/experiences/decentraland-best-architecture-metaverse)\n\n***\n\n**Application: [https://forum.decentraland.org/t/call-for-candidates-dao-committee/19215/8]()**\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x6cca0feb8906353561a0cf6ea8e305e7ee90d66b (Petaverse)\n\nShould the following $61,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nPetaverse has been active in DCL since 2021.  Since the launch of our 1st pet-themed wearable, our mission has been to create fun & joyful experiences for metaverse citizens & pet lovers.\n\nIn 2022, we built a Pet Park and a play-to-own game (-61,119) where you can feed & groom pets to earn pet-themed wearables! +6k unique users have played our game and we have collaborated with 3 Pet companies: Pedigree, PetPlate & SPOKK.\n\nIn 2023, our objective is to bring our game to the next level & distribute it across DCL deploying METAs (Metaverse Enabled Tokenized Applications) with the support of Metazone & other DCL builders. This will allow the community to contribute & benefit from the growth of Petaverse with an innovative game mechanism.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n61,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x6cca0FEb8906353561a0cF6EA8e305e7EE90d66b\n\n## Email address\n\nguillaume@comintedlabs.io\n\n## Description\n\nLet’s start with the problems we’re trying to solve:\n\n*   1st is limitations of Pet ownership in DCL: The methods of owning a pet in DCL are still to be defined. We want to build systems that will allow you to see your pet not only in your land, but in other parcels too.\n\n*   2nd is the need for more interoperability in DCL gaming. We are strongly aligned with Metazone’s vision on that end, and we believe in the power of distributed games to increase user engagement and retention.\n\nThe upgrade of the Petaverse Game will be focused in 3 action pillars:\n\n1.  Distribute the Petaverse Game across the DCL.\n\nCurrently our game is taking place exclusively in our HQ, the Pet Park - and this is the only place where you can currently earn in-game points and play with digital pets.\n\nOur game upgrade will involve creating \"METAs\" that allow landowners and players to participate in the Petaverse game by owning \"PetParks\" and \"PetStores\" that can be placed on any parcels across DCL.\n\nParcels with “PetParks” will spawn players’ own Digital Pets (the MetaPaws Gen 2) and show them as soon as pet owners join the parcel and activate spawning.\n\nParcels with “PetStores” will allow anyone to purchase Petaverse NFTs and we’ll be sharing profits with PetStore owners.\n\nPet owners will be able to see their virtual pets (MetaPaws Gen 2) & complete quests at any PetParks locations to earn in-game points\n\nWe will keep the main Petaverse HQ location as some of your daily quests as a pet owner will still need to be done exclusively there (Feeding & grooming)\n\n2.  Redefining Pet Ownership in Decentraland\n\nIn the current version of our game, you cannot play with your own personalised pet - your quests are limited to feeding & grooming the pets that are in the Petaverse HQ.\n\nWhile our game is fun and addictive, we believe bringing true pet ownership to DCL will create a exciting experience for the DCL community.\n\nIn this game upgrade - we will be launching a new generation of unique Petaverse Pets (the MetaPaw Gen 2) that will be truly yours, customizable with accessories and visible across DCL. We will be selling them through an NFT drop. We plan on making it affordable ($20)\n\nAs you play our game, you will not only win in-game points & earn NFT accessories, but your digital pet will also level up and unlock new cool features (stronger point booster, exclusive accessories & giveaways)\n\n3.  Rewarding early adopters & building retention\n\nCurrently, we have close to a 1k NFT holders. In this new game upgrade we plan on providing value to our early supporters with airdrops & giveaways.\n\nThe upgrade of the game and the MetaPaw Gen 2 will be designed in a way that will generate user retention in DCL. Our goal is to create pets that our community will feel emotionally attached to and our game mechanism will motivate them to come back to DCL. For example, if you don’t show up to pet your dog for a long period of time, your pet will lose LVL and Pts.\n\nOur achievements so far:\n\n*   Developed a competitive play-to-own game where you can feed/groom dogs & cats to earn points and use these points to claim pet-themed wearables\n*   \\+6k unique users played our game in under a year, and 100s have claimed wearables using our in-game points.\n*   Organized a dozen of events in DCL\n*   12 wearables & +1000 wearable owners\n*   IRL pet brands collabs: PetPlate (https://petaverse.petplate.com/) , Pedigree (foster dog) & Spokk (activation)\n*   Press & our socials: https://linktr.ee/petaverse.com\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMonth 1-2:\n\n*   Design of the MetaPaws Gen 2 (11,111 unique pets)\n*   Design Improvement to the Petaverse HQ\n*   Migrate to SDK 7\n*   Level system: New points (LVL, hearts and bones)\n\nMonth 3-4:\n\n*   Design of the PetStores meta\n*   Design of the PetPark meta\n*   Launch of the MetaPaws Gen 2\n*   MetaPaws Gen 2 in-game\n*   Development of PetParks: METAs for pet interactions\n*   MetaZone integration\n\nMonth 5-6:\n\n*   Development of PetStores: Storefront META for purchasing wearables and accessories\n*   Accessories: Pet wearables that boost rewards\n*   NFT Drop on Metazone\n*   QA and UX improvements\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "WebXR - The future of VR in Decentraland",
    "body": "> by 0x8b257b97c0e07e527b073b6513ba8ea659279b61 (Morph)\n\nShould the problem/opportunity outlined be refined and taken to the next level?\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nIt is going to be increasingly difficult to retain feature parity, and user parity, across three different verticals (Browser/Desktop/VR), especially with dozens of VR devices and multiple interfaces.\n\nWe need a solution that brings these clients closer together, instead of silo-ing them further apart. What's more, we need a solution that leverages the current client and technology we have, instead of creating more clients for the foundation/DAO to maintain.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe browser is one of the greatest interoperable technologies ever developed, a majority of which run on the same open source technology (Chromium) and is compatible with nearly every device in the world.\n\nWebXR is an open interface for VR devices to connect to 3D content in the browser. All VR devices, including the latest Apple headset, have webXR support (including Quest). By simply opening a URL/browser window in VR, users can immediately connect to VR platforms, all with the modern security and functionality of browsers.\n\nYou can see this technology for yourself, already in use at Hyperfy, another open metaverse with similar ideals to Decentraland.\n\nYou can read more about the WebXR spec here:\n\nhttps://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/explainer.html\n\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nThe original premise of Decentraland was a VR platform and open source SDK, to enable the future open metaverse.\n\nI believe this is a large driving force behind MANAs continued valuation, and much of the user/developer interest in the space.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems this has been removed from the current foundation roadmap.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nYou may be quick to dismiss the browser, as an older, outdated technology when compared to the higher graphics and FPS available on the desktop client - however, webGPU is a new technology that can deploy graphics card resources to render in-browser, this technology alongside our metaverse 3D engine already available in-browser would be incredibly powerful, secure, and easier to jump into than a desktop download.\n\nWe should begin to test webXR and integrations for when webGPU is ready, we may find webXR even provides a decent VR experience in-browser with higher end devices right now.\n\nTo begin, we do not need full body tracking like VRChat, we simply need a user to be able to walk around as their avatar, see other users in browser/desktop mode, interact with world objects, and use voice chat.\n\nA proof of concept webXR integration would enable this, without requiring additional backend changes to current character interfaces. It also seems that .VRM was discussed as being on the roadmap at recent avatar Q\\&A sessions, which can be leveraged together with this concept.\n\nLong term, full body tracking will be a necessity, however I believe this kind of functionality would be perfectly suited for our distributed node system thanks to local latency options, and could perhaps even be a paid premium feature used to incentivize more nodes.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Default REALM and SOLO Mode Implementation",
    "body": "> by 0xb8782cf628357ce2751a4ea3007934048fbaa672\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should Decentraland have a default realm and solo mode?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7c1a2280-0f72-11ee-bb17-db98a4ce871d)\n\n## Summary\n\nProposal with implementation details for how the default realm and solo mode will be implemented.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe social engagement of the platform is hindered by the complexity of navigating realms, coordinating locations, and connecting with friends. This has led to the suggestion of implementing a default realm to better connect users, while also offering the option for a solo mode to explore the world individually. As a result, this enhancement will simplify the process of connecting with others in Genesis City, while also providing individuals the option to enjoy scenes without being overwhelmed by a flood of users or chat messages.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThrough several user interviews, a common sentiment expressed was that the metaverse tends to feel lonely and isolated, with users experiencing difficulties in meeting communities or friends. Furthermore, press releases from high-profile events have brought to attention some situations where they found themselves in realms with a low user base and reported low participation in their news when, in fact, they just ended up in a realm with a low user count. These situations highlight the impact of users being dispersed among separated realms by default. On the other hand, there are some experienced platform users that like the fact of having realms to jump to an empty server and be able to explore a scene by themselves without being flooded by avatars or chat messages and this could be easily managed from the UI without needing to jump to a different realm.\n\nThis fueled the idea of having a default realm, when users enter the platform, they will be directed to a default realm where all users are initially placed together. Once a user is in the default realm, they will have the flexibility to choose between either moving to a different realm or activating the solo mode to explore the world in isolation. These actions could be initiated at any time.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe upcoming section discusses the technical details of necessary changes. Let's start with an overview of the current design. Each Catalyst node includes a comms service that enables real-time messaging between players. However, this design has drawbacks:\n\n*   Users can only interact with others using the same comms service instance. Even if two users are in the same scene, but connected to different comms services, they cannot see or interact with each other.\n*   Scalability is limited because a Catalyst node runs all services on the same computer. These services compete for hardware resources, imposing a constraint on the number of open connections a comms service can handle. As a result, there is a maximum limit on the number of users a realm can effectively manage. If the limit is reached, new users cannot join until more resources are available.\n\nThe proposed solution involves each Catalyst node registering an external comms service to replace the internal one. By doing this, the hardware resources initially allocated to the internal comms service can be freed up and used by other services. This allows different node operators to share a comms service but it should be noted that the service won't be composed of a single computer or process and it will be a set of scalable microservices, ensuring efficient resource utilization and accommodating the growing user load.\n\nSetting up a custom comms service will be as straightforward as running a Catalyst bundle of services. This will empower anyone to easily spin up their own comms without complexity or technical hurdles.\n\nUsers will establish a connection to the default comms service when logging into Decentraland, similar to how they connect to a Matrix server for chat. The purpose of this comms service is to facilitate user interaction and handle their positions, regardless of which Catalyst node they use to download scenes.\n\nCatalyst owners have the flexibility to configure their nodes to utilize either the default comms service or deploy their own using the provided bundle. This choice can be modified as needed, granting them control over the comms service employed. As a consequence, the existing mechanism for changing realms will remain intact, although the number of realms may decrease due to multiple nodes sharing the same comms service. Nevertheless, users will still enjoy the freedom to switch between realms, ensuring that no one is limited to the default realm.\n\nIn solo mode, users can disconnect from the comms service, disabling interactions with others. They won't have access to voice chat or nearby chat channels. Solo mode allows users to explore the virtual world without engaging with others.\n\nRegarding Catalyst endpoints, moving the comms service also involves relocating the endpoints responsible for reporting islands and users. Catalyst nodes will expose the URL of the comms service they use, providing the same functionality. The following changes are needed:\n\n*   /about: The comms object will expose the registered comms service of the Catalyst node.\n*   /explore/realms: The content will change to show the list of Catalysts and their names, but the comms information will be moved to the new service.\n\nThe new comms service will expose the following endpoints:\n\n*   /comms/islands\n*   /comms/islands/{islandId}\n*   /comms/peers\n*   /explore/hot-scenes\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe implementation of the default realm and solo mode has a significant impact on the platform and its users. Here are the key outcomes:\n\n*   Enhanced Social Engagement: By introducing a default realm where users are initially placed together, the platform promotes a stronger sense of community and facilitates easier connections among users.\n*   Flexibility for Personal Exploration: The addition of the solo mode provides users with the freedom to explore the world by themselves.\n*   Enhanced User Experience: With a default realm, users no longer have to navigate multiple realms to meet with friends, reducing confusion and complexity.\n*   Maintains the platform's decentralization by allowing any node operator to run their own comms service.\n*   Simpler and More Accurate Hot-Scenes Calculation: Currently each Catalyst node must gather communication information from all nodes in the network and perform its own hot-scenes calculations, resulting in potential delays and slight variations in the data across realms. The default-realm model reduces the number of necessary requests and increases the accuracy and consistency of real-time data.\n*   More scalable solution: current implementation hosts all services on a single computer, the Catalyst node, imposing a physical constraint on the number of open connections that a single comms service can handle. By adopting this approach, it becomes feasible to scale the communication service by adding additional computers to support more users under the same realm.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x7bbea9c18cd0541acab8c19da2b11d0c03faef1c (1Existence)\n\nThere currently is not a slogan for Decentraland that would be good for advertising. The closest thing to one that anyone found is \"The first-ever virtual world owned by its users\".\nA memorable and unique slogan could help to elevate Decentraland's brand recognition, underline our core values, and create a strong emotional connection with our diverse user base. The reasons for having a slogan are:\n\n*   Brand Recognition: A memorable slogan can help people recognize and remember the Decentraland brand. It can become a shorthand for what Decentraland stands for, making it easier for people to understand what the platform is about.\n\n*   Communicates Core Values: A good slogan can encapsulate the core values and mission of Decentraland, helping to communicate to users and potential users what the platform stands for and what they can expect from using it.\n\n*   Differentiates from Competitors: In the crowded space of digital and virtual platforms, a unique slogan can help set Decentraland apart from its competitors. It can highlight what makes Decentraland unique and why users should choose it over other platforms.\n\n*   Creates an Emotional Connection: A powerful slogan can also create an emotional connection between the brand and its users. This connection can foster loyalty and encourage users to become more engaged with the platform.\n\n*   Marketing and Promotional Tool: Lastly, a slogan can be a useful tool in marketing and promotional materials. It can be used in advertisements, social media posts, and other promotional materials to catch people's attention and draw them into the platform.\n\nSome possible options would be:\n\n*   Build, Explore, and Create with Decentraland\n*   Decentraland: Where Imagination Meets Reality\n*   Your World, Your Rules - That's Decentraland\n*   Venture into the Virtual - Discover Decentraland\n*   Unleash Your Digital Destiny with Decentraland\n*   Decentraland: The Unimagined, Realized\n*   Decentraland: Where Your Dreams Have Already Come to Life\n\nIf it is decided that Decentraland should have a slogan, the next step would be to determine what that slogan should be.  If in favor, please comment on the ones listed or feel free to come up with one you like best.\n\n- Yes, DCL Slogan\n- No not needed\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

After discussions with GSS, we decided to re-propose it under the correct category.\n\n[The Meta Residence Tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seuvP9rKaw4) (MRT) project seeks to address the hurdles that Decentraland users currently face when trying to access or create customised virtual spaces.\nThe present method, which requires the costly and time-consuming hiring of developers, needs an alternative.\nMRT offers a simple, no-code solution for the citizens of Decentraland.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n100,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n5 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xb12ba0b2dc9d9811a7e3b1f76b3f8318bcb58f20\n\n## Email address\n\ndigalgfund@pm.me\n\n## Description\n\nThrough these problem-solving features, the MRT project aims to revolutionize the way Decentraland citizens access, create,\nand interact with virtual spaces, offering a cost-effective and user-friendly alternative to the current process.\n\nThe Meta Residence Tower represents a virtual skyscraper with 10,000 NFT apartments (spaces).\nAccess to an apartment is provided with an NFT key, which the user can purchase on the website or in the building itself.\n\nThe building offers four types of layouts: Studio, 1BHK, 2BHK, and Penthouse. There is also the possibility to make it an open space.\n\nEach apartment includes an [interior design constructor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVGA5h7UOa0) with more than  [700 furniture items](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z37-VCmCHzY) (from bedroom to bathroom),\nalong with options for ceilings, floors, and wallpapers. Users can create\n[unique furniture arrangements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk_qlz0o8xU)\nwith this tool.\n\nAll project features, including the builder, smart-items, and upgrades, can be found in the last proposal.\nOf course, we've made a lot of additions since then.\nPlease check out [real-time development changelog](https://mrt.games/changelog/changelog.html)\nwhere you can see about a hundred of pull requests from the last proposal.\n\n#### The progress since last proposal:\n\n*   New upgrades (10 in total) & Smart Items (30 in total) include:\n*   Open Space: The ability to remove all walls and create an open, flat space.\n*   A ticketing system allowing users to sell tickets for events they hold, either permanently or one-time.\n*   A subscription-based video streaming service.\n*   An event system: Space owners can highlight their events on an internal Event board.\n*   Teleport from flat to location\n*   Teleport from flat to flat\n*   Custom text\n*   The ability to enter the tower and user's flat WITHOUT WEB3.\n*   Dozens of UI elements\n*   Scene animations (doors, elevators, NPCs)\n*   Numerous CI/CD additions\n*   Several team and user-made interactive experiences (mini-games and quest-like stories) showcasing the possibilities of creating games with MRT's easy to learn integrated builder.\n*   We also hold a [Mini Game Jam](https://twitter.com/residence_meta/status/1671473383500836870) event for game makers\n*   Scene optimisation for more than 100mb of space.\n*   Asset optimisation to improve scene loading times and performance.\n*   Tutorials on using features.\n*   $5k in sales from the last proposal even during this bear market and despite currently limited userbase.\n\n#### Social aspect & UGC\n\nWhile we've already built a substantial feature and technical base, I'd like to highlight the Community part and UGC.\nThe Tower hosts many community events:\n\n*   [Babydolls live from Penthouse is a weekly event](https://twitter.com/tangpoko/status/1673785017456099329)\n\n*   [DJ-Trax has held numerous parties](https://twitter.com/DJTRAXNFT/status/1665165977451995137)\n\n*   [Dcl Brazil Birthday Party](https://twitter.com/DCL_Brasil/status/1661173813126610949)\n\n*   [We were a venue for BeatTrekker events](https://twitter.com/BeatTrekker/status/1665356418474561536)\n\n*   And dozens of other residents.\n\nOver 80% of our 800 tweets are user-generated content.

    "title": "Dhingia Builds HQ: Play to Build Ecosystem in Decentraland",
    "body": "> by 0x447c9058be5c164e0c4aae380381e7a5215052d4 (MrDhingia)\n\nShould the following $96,400 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nDhingia Builds proposes Dhingia HQ, user-empowering project in Decentraland, extrapolated from a successful demo launched in Arpril 2023. Dhingia HQ integrates a unique crafting system where users gather various crafting resources, or \"Craftons,\" and use them in machines to create personalized 3D builds, assets, wearables, and custom 1/1 Dhingia Build Passes. These user-created entities not only express individuality but significantly enhance Decentraland's aesthetic and interactive landscape. Leveraging our expertise from designing over 80 unique builds including 35+ open-source structures to the Decentraland’s Awesome Repository.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n96,400 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xc13c6B69073252667531637f3711461e80dffB6A\n\n## Email address\n\ninfo@dhingiabuilds.com\n\n## Description\n\nDhingia HQ is an evolution of our basic demo version including of a simple brick collection system, launched back in April 2023, which had a fantastic response from the community. Our aim is to bring a new level of creative freedom and active participation for the users in Decentraland, taking advantage of the vast possibilities of the Decentraland.\n\nThe core of Dhingia HQ is the innovative crafting system we've developed. Here's how it works: Users can gather resources, which we call \"Craftons,\" from specific areas designated for harvesting resources within the HQ. Once they've collected Craftons, they can use our crafting machines to transform these resources into customised 3D builds, unique wearables, or personalised 1/1 Dhingia-Build Passes. The crafting machines come in different types, from basic to more complex, with upgraded versions available as users progress.\n\nThe items users can create with the Craftons are varied and diverse, ranging from common items to extremely rare ones. This means users can add unique aesthetic touches to their Decentraland experience. The rarer the materials users gather and the more they experiment with combinations, the higher the value of the items they can craft.\n\nBut Dhingia HQ is more than just a place to craft items. It's an engaging space designed to enhance user interaction and exploration. We've got different areas designated for various activities: there are spaces to gather materials, hubs for crafting, areas with interactive puzzles and obstacle courses that reward users with prizes. To help users navigate and make the most of these areas, we'll have AI guides providing insights about digital architecture, crafting, and more.\nWe will also create a Builder’s workshop, which is designed as a hub for all Decentraland builders, both experienced and aspiring. Here, they can gather to share ideas, learn from each other, and have meaningful discussions about architectural designs, virtual builds, and other related topics.\n\nBeyond crafting and exploring, Dhingia HQ will also serve as a vibrant hub for Decentraland's community and culture. We're planning to customise and create new thematic builds on the HQ for every major festival and event in Decentraland. We have excecuted this during the Decentraland Metaverse Fashion Week 2023 (can check it out here - https://www.mrdhingia.com/post/dhingia-fashion-buzz-at-mvfw23-decentraland ), and it was a huge success. The event saw high engagement levels and positive feedback from the community, and we're convinced that Dhingia HQ can be a key venue for celebrating the metaverse's shared events and milestones.\n\nMoreover, to keep the spirit of competition and achievement alive, we plan on hosting in-game tournaments. These tournaments will include various tasks and challenges, and winners will be rewarded with MANA, Mythic wearables, and other exciting prizes. This will not only encourage more user interaction but also contribute to the overall vibrancy and dynamism of Decentraland.\n\nLastly, our Dhingia-Build Passes add another dimension to user creativity. Users can craft these passes to commission custom builds for their personal use from Dhingia Builds, allowing them to leave their unique imprint on the Decentraland landscape.\n\nOverall, our vision for Dhingia HQ is a user-centric, dynamic space that enhances the Decentraland experience by offering the opportunity to craft, explore, and celebrate the metaverse's shared events.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nJuly 2023:\n\n*   Continue development on the main structure of Dhingia HQ.\n*   Begin the development of the resource gathering area, where users will collect crafting  materials.\n\nAugust 2023:\n\n*   Finalise the resource gathering area and implement the first set of crafting materials.\n*   Start development on the central crafting mechanism, where users will use materials to create unique designs.\n\nSeptember 2023:\n\n*   Complete the central crafting mechanism and begin collecting user feedback for improvements.\n*   Initiate development on the quest and challenges system, aiming to enhance user engagement through mission-oriented gameplay.\n\nOctober 2023:\n\n*   Complete and launch the quests and challenges system.\n*   Begin work on the interactive obstacle course to further engage and challenge users.\n\nNovember 2023:\n\n*   Complete and launch the interactive obstacle course.\n*   Start development on AI assistants to guide users through the various aspects of Dhingia HQ.\n*   Begin development on the Builder Workshop, where users can get more creative with their designs.\n\nDecember 2023:\n\n*   Complete and launch the AI assistants and Builder Workshop.\n*   Final polishing, bug fixing, and optimization based on community feedback.\n*   Official launch of Dhingia HQ with full functionality.\n\nFollowing the development timeline, it's important to note that the crafting of custom builds, wearables, and build passes will only commence after the full crafting system has been implemented and deployed.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Community NFT TCG Framework",
    "body": "> by 0xc24789c6f165329290ddd3fbeac3b6842a294003 (TheCryptoTrader)\n\nShould the following $54,500 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThrough this grant, I am seeking funding to develop an open-source trading card game (TCG) framework that will allow users to create their own TCG in Decentraland (DCL). This tool will utilise blockchain technology, allowing users to create experiences where players can own and trade their own card collections. Users will be provided the functionality to be able to grow their card collection, customise their decks, and duel each other.\n\nAs per community feedback, this proposal has been broken into pieces to better represent deliverables. This grant covers the creation of the Framework (a tool for creating NFT TCGs in Decentraland) and a few sample cards (NOT the full game populated with assets, NFT cards, or events).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n54,500 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003\n\n## Email address\n\nthecryptotrader69@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nCollectible card games are a famously popular genre of game where players compete against one another using custom decks composed of cards they have collected. This is a hobby (and profession) for millions of people across the globe. There are several extremely popular online TCGs (Hearthstone, Gwent, ESL), but they do not allow users to actively trade their cards or participate in an economy. By leveraging the immense popularity of this genre and utilising NFTs, we can offer a novel solution that empowers users to own and trade their cards, leading to substantial growth on the platform.\n\nThis is a smaller part of a long-term project (spanning 9 months) that will see both the creation of an open-source TCG framework and a playable TCG built using that framework. Not only will we be providing the community with a powerful tool to create their own TCGs and creating a new experience in Decentraland, we’ve also developed a sustainability plan that should allow the project to have continual development past the grant’s endpoint without additional community funding.\n\nThe first phase of this project will be the creation of the TCG framework. This framework will empower creators by providing all the utilities and tools required to create their own TCG in Decentraland. This includes easy ways to create cards, define card effects/mechanics, manage decks, and duelling other players.\n\nUsers will be able to maintain collections of cards on the blockchain via NFTs. All cards will be viewable in Decentraland, displaying the actual card and its associated model/effects. Users will also be able to modify and save their decks, allowing them to use the same decks across multiple scenes.\n\nUsers can also battle each other by engaging in duels. In these fights users will need to use a strategic mindset to overcome their opponent’s deck. These battles will follow the standard TCG formula: players expend energy to play cards during their, command units to attack, and attempt to claim victory by expending their rival’s hit points. Cards will appear in their 2D form when in the player’s hand, but when played they will expand into a 3D character (much like the popular TV show Yu-Gi-Oh). Card characters have animations/effects that are triggered by certain interactions (attack, death, ability, etc.).\n\nUpon the success of this grant, we are planning on requesting a future grant to fund the creation of a high-quality TCG built off this framework. After it has been fully developed, we will be hosting events (contests and tournaments)\n\nAs detailed before, all components of this grant and future grants for this project are going to be open-source, making *everything* produced free for the community to use and build upon. This also includes the cards and characters used in the TCG, as well as the management server used for storing player stats/data/game-play.\n\nThis grant only targets the first phase of the full project's plan: the creation of the TCG Framework (not the game, NFTs, or assets). You can view the previous draft of the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C8fbnRbEpZ90iMNVv8ESW5dGuthX-NY-sd_OxqfSNj8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### PHASE 0 - Viability\n\nThis phase has already been conducted. The team has been assembled and we've discussed the project thoroughly: everyone understands their roles and what is expected. Design documents outlining the systems and assets required for the module have been prepared.\n\n### PHASE 1 - TCG Framework Development (CURRENT PHASE)\n\n#### Estimated Length - 3 months\n\nDuring this stage we will be creating the TCG framework. This will be the underlying infrastructure of the project and will provide the following features:\n\n*   maintain collections of cards on the blockchain via NFTs\n*   manage card collections/decks in Decentraland\n*   core card keyword actions/play effects & characters\n\n### PHASE 2 -  TCG Development\n\n#### Estimated Length - 4 months\n\nDuring this stage the full DCL TCG (with 46 total cards) will be developed and deployed. This game will showcase the joint power of blockchain integration within Decentraland.\n\n### PHASE 3 - TCG Testing and Events\n\n#### Estimated Length - 2 months\n\nDuring this stage the Framework and TCG will be put to the test by the community! We'll be hosting several community events  to draw attention to the project and Decentraland!\n\n### PHASE 4 - Maintenance and Expansion\n\n#### Estimated Length - continuous\n\nAfter the Framework and TCG have been successfully developed and our grant period comes to an end, we will continue working on the project as funding allows. This includes polishing/adding content, expanding the framework, and hosting events.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This is the basis of our vision of the Industry of the virtual worlds, and this is why we’ve decided to simultaneously run the event on two platforms to emphasize this idea. In Decentraland, a massive town would be developed especially for this event, and from there, you could teleport to the world in the W3rlds to explore even more unique spaces.**\n\n![](//imgur.com/Gawwxfx.png)\n\n**- colossal exhibition space in two platforms: Decentraland and W3rlds**\n\n**- architectural competition open to creators with any experience**\n\n**- more than 30 pavilions by creators from all over the world**\n\n**- expositions by well-known architects and designers**\n\n**- lectures and public talks**\n\n**- thousands of amazing people to meet during the event**\n\nThe event will consist of several pavilions designed by well-known architectural studios, and emerging designers selected by an open contest. In addition, there will be lectures, discussions, NFT exhibitions, art installations, and more, so anyone interested in architecture and design can enjoy the event.\n\nWe are proud to announce that we have already secured partnerships with top-tier architecture and design studios to become participants and creators of the event, such as **Killa Design, Soomeen Hahm, ATRIUM, HWKN Architects, Spaces DAO, PLP Architecture, SA Lab, LAVA, Mariana Cabugueira, Il Prisma, iheartblob, and Illusorr (full list).**\n\n### OPEN CALL FOR PARTICIPANTS\n\n**1st STAGE: OPEN CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS**\n\nCandidates will send three visualizations of the 3d-modeled architectural objects reflecting the theme of the Biennale “Presence of the Future” and a 200-500 words description of the concept. The jury would rate all projects by concept, formal/spatial complexity, and atmosphere (use of light, textures, and landscape). The function of the space is not limited: to an event hall, showroom, maze, etc.\n\n**2nd STAGE: FINALISTS PROJECTS REALISATION**\n\nAll finalists are guaranteed to receive a grant from the organizers to produce the final spaces for the event. All submitted projects will be checked by the technical team and placed on the event web before opening. On the event's final day, the jury announces the best project of the Biennale, and its creators are invited to become the jury of the next event.\n\n### SPACE\n\n**Since the Biennale is advantageous for developing Decentraland and the industry, we’ve contacted the Decentraland Foundation and have already agreed to hold an event at one of the Plazas, which are 20x20 parcels.**\n\nWe are working on the master plan and public spaces for the upcoming Biennale. After generating several co-ordinally different space structure variants, analyzing each, and searching for pitfalls, we settled on a variant. The architectural city is inspired by green futuristic-fantasy towns, with tree houses and a multi-level communication system between the works of participants and public spaces, which resembles the structure of tree growth.\n\n![](//imgur.com/UvzJRug.png)\n![](//imgur.com/XVbiG0E.png)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Already done / in process** - concept and planning / partnerships / headliners & jury invitations / creation of event program / onboarding the best architects & designers / masterplan design & modeling / event release\n\n**1st month** - the masterplan turns detailed and ready to develop / developing team onboarding / developing & modeling of event space / event release & shilling / open call for creators / Metaverse worlds building / wearables modeling\n\n**2nd month** - the end of the construction of the worlds and their unification / media coverage / wearables creation & minting / marketing / building of community / developing & modeling of event space / events developing / wearables minting\n\n**3rd month** - finish of developing / testing & bug fixing / deploying public versions of the buildings and worlds / 4-days festival with events and architect contest final\n\n**4th month** - post-production / post-PR / media coverage / after-events / creating of Decentraland Worlds with the works of participants\n\n![](//imgur.com/eYYPRuy.png)\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

You could opt for a conventional  choice and have a basic, boring banker or maybe you could switch it up and explore more imaginative options-  like a botanist beekeeper who does banking! You could have a futuristic florist, a spooky salesman supervisor, a royal robotics engineer or even a mediaeval marine biologist- well, maybe not that one, that option seems a bit far-fetched.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n25,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n5 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x07424b254b72b2272764100a98A6EB338F2FFBD0\n\n## Email address\n\ndokidcl@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nDoki’s NPC Pick ‘n Mix strives to enhance the feeling of being within Decentraland by providing a diverse range of creative crowds, audiences and a sense of belonging.\n\nPerhaps you find yourself pressed for time and can’t seem to find an artist on time? No problem, with the Pick n’ Mix you can create your NPC within a matter of minutes.\n\nMaybe you want to showcase the quality of your brand within your land? Within seconds you can scour through the repository and find themes that fit what you’re looking for and will showcase and reflect the quality of your brand within the quality of the NPCs themselves.\n\nLet’s suppose you want to deliver information to people who visit your land in a creative and fun way? Well because the NPCs can be created within such a  short time, you can spend more time making your NPCs give information or tutorials in a fun and interactive way! Each NPC head will have moveable eyes, tongue and teeth so if you’d like to go the extra mile you could even have facial animations to further elevate you and your audience’s experience!\n\nDo you ever visit your land and sometimes feel like it’s empty and not want anyone else to experience that? By swiftly assembling these NPCs and placing them within your land, you’ll be able to create a feeling of belonging and crowdedness as these NPCs roam or relax around your land.\n\nTo summarize, Doki’s NPC Pick n' Mix aims to help you create high quality NPCs that you can create in a short amount of time to spruce up your land in a creative way all while having fun - because let’s be honest- it can be quite fun to dress up characters every now and then, right?\n\nTo finish, you won’t have to worry about copyright issues as all items in the Pick n’ Mix are free to use within Decentraland as NPCs, eliminating any  concerns you may have regarding copyright infringement.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nItem Roadmap\nThere will be 5 themes overall, 1 per month.\n\nIn each theme there will be:\n\nUpper Body:\n2 females, 2 males, 1 unisex (2 x Multiple colour/pattern options and 3+ skintone options).\n\nLower Body: 2 females, 2 males, 1 unisex (2 x Multiple colour/pattern options and 3+ skintone options).\n\nFull Body:  1 female, 1 male (2 x Multiple colour/pattern options and 3+ skintone options).\n\nShoes: 1 unisex (2 x Multiple colour/pattern options and 3+ skintone options IF needed.)\n\nHeads: 1 female, 1 male (3+ skintone options).\n\nHair:  1 unisex hair (12 x colour options and 3+ skintone options IF needed).\n\nAccessories (Bracelets, earrings, backpacks etc): 1 unisex (Multiple colour options x 2+)\n\nAn average of 90 modular items minimum created a month.\n\n***\n\nMonthly Roadmap\n\nWeek 1:\n3D model high poly wearables.\n\nWeek 2 :\nContinue 3D modelling high poly  wearables.\nRetopology and bake wearables.\n\nWeek 3:\nFinish baking wearables and texture wearables.\n\nWeek 4:\nRig and test wearables.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Those contributions include some of the largest weekly gatherings in DCL, serving as an entry point for many metaverse music fans, and writing the blueprint for dozens of artists and DJs to follow. A grant from the Decentraland DAO will help StoneyEye develop greater opportunities in the art and music spaces of DCL, while also bringing additional web2 producers and musicians into Decentraland. These efforts will be conducted with the goal of increasing new users in DCL and improving user retention.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x082f2A8ea1D8E3ee24c20d12452B7E851ad0D5DD\n\n## Email address\n\nsespromusic@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nStoney’s ability to engage with DCL audiences results in an environment that has become synonymous with Decentraland performances–quality music combined with social engagement, both in-world and on social platforms. The rapid growth of music communities in DCL can be traced from his first residency at Parcel Party, which became a must-attend weekly event for many users. Beginning in November, 2021, a Stoney event has been on the calendar nearly every week, including the addition of MoFyah Mondays at the TRU Band Room and MoBeatz every-other Sunday. During a period with decreased attendance across much of Decentraland, Stoney has continued to generate good-sized audiences, which benefits other DCL projects and creators by creating a reliable, consistent pathway into DCL for new users.\n\nPrior to his time in Decentraland, Stoney began his career as a successful recording/touring musician and producer, sharing the stage with numerous A-list acts. His experience in the greater world of music provides an invaluable education for independent musicians entering web3. The melding of art, music, social content, and community engagement is what creates the unique environment of DCL music. In addition to presenting his own music, Stoney has collaborated with several other musicians and DJs in the space, furthering the strength of bond in metaverse music. As brands and investors look to Decentraland as a viable platform for messaging and events, the community fostered by DCL musicians becomes even more important by providing consistent engagement opportunities.\n\nIn addition to music, Stoney also contributes to visual arts and design in Decentraland. He is a prolific artist and wearable creator, who consistently contributes forward-thinking designs to help highlight DCL. His hand-drawn art has appeared on dozens of event attendance tokens, increasing the value proposition of attending his shows. Late last year, Stoney began MoBeatz, an interactive event, during which a piece of music is created live. In collaboration with DCL community members, these “beats” are minted and airdropped to all attendees. This innovative approach to user engagement provides an opportunity to engage with prominent music producers, which again provides a compelling reason for new users to enter Decentraland.\n\nFunding from the Decentraland DAO will help establish the framework for artist self-sufficiency in the metaverse. In addition to upgrading equipment, building a long-term social engagement events strategy, this grant will build on the existing mentorship opportunities already provided by Stoney. This education will bring more musicians, artists, and producers to DCL, increasing attendance and showcasing the strength of community.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RoadRunner778/status/1658561199846600704   TRU Band Room- Mo Fyah Monday\nhttps://twitter.com/fermion_dcl_eth/status/1516926795945283584    Parcel Party- Magic Hour\nhttps://twitter.com/RoadRunner778/status/1622575622852866049  Mo Beatz\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV0hTqTcRg  Metazoo\n\nNote- This proposal is for one year's worth of work in 6 months of payment\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nScheduled Events:\nAugust 2023: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios\nSeptember 2023: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios\nOctober 2023: 5 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios\nNovember 2023: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios\nDecember 2023: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios\nJanuary 2024: 5 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios\nFebruary 2024: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios\nMarch 2024: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 3 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios\nApril 2024: 5 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios\nMay 2024: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios\nJune 2024: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 3 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios\nJuly 2024: 5 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios\n\nEvery Monday at TRU Band Room for MoFyah.

    "title": "2dcl - DCL's 2D Alternate Universe: Deployment and Discovery",
    "body": "> by 0x270722b5222968603e4650c3b70a7dfb971ed5b6 (frantufro)\n\nShould the following $42,500 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nFollowing the release of [2dcl](https://2dcl.org), we are want to continue its development. Here are the features we'll work on:\n\n### Simplified Scene Upload\n\nBuild an integrated authentication and signing workflow. remove the dependency on the SDK CLI.\n\n### Enhanced Content Discovery\n\nBuild an online database that with the scenes deployed to 2dcl. This will be accessible online and from the client.\n\n### Streamlined Login\n\nWe will implement a MetaMask login workflow, thereby eliminating the need for config file editing.\n\n### Talking to others\n\nSupport meeting other players and enable chatting with them. This will involve implementing the comms endpoints in our catalyst client library, and we will leverage Worlds for this feature as well.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n42,500 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n4 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xa63A3eeE0101e61f3c970445A237ED04785ad145\n\n## Email address\n\nfran@hiddenpeople.club\n\n## Description\n\n### Description\n\n### Background\n\nDespite several delays, we launched the [first version of 2dcl](https://2dcl.org) in May.\n\n![2dcl client](https://2dcl.org/2dcl.jpg)\n\nUsers can:\n\n*   Walk around 2dcl.\n*   Design and deploy scenes.\n*   Add an eth address and visualize their pixelated avatar.\n\nIn our initial grant, we accomplished the following:\n\n*   Developed an open-source Rust library to facilitate communication with Catalyst: [Catalyst Library](https://github.com/2dcl/2dcl/tree/main/catalyst)\n*   Created a Scene Definition structure to support 2d scenes: [Scene Definition](https://github.com/2dcl/2dcl/blob/main/docs/RFC-1.md)\n*   Constructed an open-source explorer to render 2d scenes: [Rust Explorer](https://github.com/2dcl/2dcl/tree/main/2dcl)\n*   Introduced an automatic 3d to 2d avatar conversion tool within the explorer.\n*   Made minor enhancements to the catalyst, protocol and RFC documentation.\n*   Conducted experiments (though ultimately discontinued [1](https://github.com/2dcl/2dcl/pull/4), [2](https://github.com/2dcl/2dcl/pull/13)) on employing ECS6 to automatically transform 3d scenes into 2d.\n*   Wrote a [guide on deploying scenes](https://github.com/2dcl/2dcl/blob/main/docs/guides/scene_creation.md).\n*   Developed a [sample scene](https://github.com/2dcl/sample-scene) and default art for empty scenes.\n\nWe failed miserably with communication, as some if you rightfully pointed out.\n\nStill, we believe that the work completed so far has been very valuable, and we are eager to continue with it.\n\n### Vision\n\nOur project vision remains consistent:\n\n*   Establishing a fully open-source 2D alternate universe developed independently from the Foundation.\n*   Creating an ecosystem of open-source tools that can be repurposed by other projects.\n*   Empowering Decentraland users with intuitive tools for creating 2D content within this alternate universe.\n\n### Specification\n\n### Simplified Scene Upload\n\nDeploying a scene to 2dcl requires you to compile it, add it to a folder and then upload via the [CLI](https://github.com/decentraland/cli). While this was ok in the initial stages, the process is quite cumbersome.\n\nWe aim to streamline this by introducing a workflow that enables users to log in with MetaMask and sign the deployment within the app. This means that, once your changes are finalized, you can deploy your scene with just a click.\n\n### Enhanced Content Discovery\n\nThough we currently have a tool that scrapes catalyst for scene data, it's not very useful. We intend to add a page to 2dcl's web that lists all the deployed scenes. This list, including the name, description, screenshot, and parcel details, would be available for anyone interested.\n\nWe plan to incorporate this list within the 2dcl explorer. The list will be updated at least once a day. We will also provide an RSS feed for users to track scene updates.\n\n### Streamlined Login\n\nWhile we offer an automatic 3D to 2D avatar conversion, the process currently involves editing a config file. This can be simplified.\n\nWe'll make this process more user-friendly with a login workflow. The goal is to allow users to get their avatars up and running with just a few clicks.\n\n### Experimentation\n\nA FAQ is whether one can see or communicate with others in 2dcl. Unfortunately, the answer is no. We hope to change this by implementing the required endpoints in our catalyst client library and exploring the use of Worlds to unite all 2dcl users.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe key milestones are:\nScene Deployment & Login (4 weeks)\nBy the end of this milestone there will be deployment and sign in workflows in the client.\nWe'll make one update to the grant page documenting this process.\n\nContent Discovery Database (3 weeks)\nBy the end of this period there will be a url inside https://2dcl.org containing a list of all the deployed scenes.\nWe'll update that least at least once a day, and if costs allow, more frequently.\nWe'll also add an update to the grant page.\n\nAdding Comms to Catalyst (2 weeks)\nWe'll add catalyst's comms endpoints to our Rust library.\nWe'll create an update and documentation on how to use this.\n\nUsing Worlds to View and Communicate with Other Peers (8 weeks)\nWe'll buy a name to create a World.\nWe'll create the required logic to use said World to allow 2dcl users to communicate via text.\nWe'll create two updates, one half-way through and another one at the end of the grant.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should LandWorks landowners keep their VP?",
    "body": "> by 0xd5c2f48d7b69129354473613c07d60106768ccbe (fungibletaco#ccbe)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Should LandWorks landowners keep their VP?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f8d574a0-fafa-11ed-8e4f-8db7948b5171)\n\n## Summary\n\nAllow LandWorks landowners to utilize their VP as at the moment it's locked in the LandWorks protocol.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\n**Update:** This is the second time this proposal is raised. Feedback from the first time was that this proposal has not been voted within EnterDAO first. On behalf of EnterDAO, I want to thank the Decentraland community for their involvement and dedication to ensure the transparency and integrity of the process. Last week [a vote was initiated within EnterDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/enterdao.xyz/proposal/0xc52d2dc717c5a3b3194b38808757dfeb7e8ecc70629b85e9f37743ddefe9cb20). The purpose of the vote was to ensure that the EnterDAO community is behind the idea of LandWorks landowners to to keep their VP when listing DCL lands on the LandWorks platform. **The result of the vote (6.7MENTR - 100% For) is indicative of the enthusiasm of the community about making this happen.**\n\nAbstract:\nAt the moment landowners who have listed their properties for rent on LandWorks cannot utilize their VP as it's locked in the LandWorks protocol. With the recently [enacted proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c98bd010-74b1-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556) by [Nacho](https://governance.decentraland.org/profile/?address=0x87956abC4078a0Cc3b89b419928b857B8AF826Ed) - Decentraland landowners can now keep their VP when listing their properties for rent on the Decentraland Marketplace . This proposal aims to allow LandWorks landowners to keep their VP as well.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe LandWorks landowner community has requested to utilize their VP as they believe they can be more invested in the Decentraland DAO. Therefore this proposal is due to the collective request by the LandWorks landowner community.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n[LandWorks](https://landworks.xyz/) is a metaverse land rental marketplace. It’s a product of EnterDAO and was launched with support for Decentraland in January 2022. Since its inception, LandWorks has supported Decentraland LANDs and ESTATEs rentals and so far has accumulated over [300 rents](https://dune.com/rakis/LandWorks).\n\nThe protocol has been active in the Decentraland community. Last summer LandWorks hosted the [Open Scenes Grant Program](https://landworks.xyz/app/grants-program) where more than $50,000 were rewarded to builders in the Decentraland community for their scene creations. The scenes were also open sources for anyone to use them. We have also purchased a 2x2 ESTATE where we have our [signature scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKZ74OJnwvI) which has already hosted [two parties](https://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=f6480837-0a94-4ac9-bb14-77c294ec51a1) for our community and friends.\n\nWith the recently [enacted proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c98bd010-74b1-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556) by [Nacho](https://governance.decentraland.org/profile/?address=0x87956abC4078a0Cc3b89b419928b857B8AF826Ed) - Decentraland landowners can now keep their VP when engaging in a rental transaction. This has been requested by our landowners community as well and we would like to allow for landowners using LandWorks to keep their VP as well.\n\nOur development team has already created the snapshot strategy based on the enacted proposal. The code is available [here](https://github.com/EnterDAO/snapshot-strategies/tree/decentraland/landworks-rents/src/strategies/decentraland-landworks-rents).\n\nThis could potentially allocate back about 320,000 VP to a small community who have proactively requested to use their VP.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe imapct of this proposal is to include VP of LAND/Estate that have been listed in LandWorks. As the community has expressed interest in this,\nwe have implemented a strategy, similar to the one created for Decentraland's [Renting protocol](https://github.com/EnterDAO/snapshot-strategies/tree/master/src/strategies/decentraland-rental-lessors). You can find the implementation [here](https://github.com/EnterDAO/snapshot-strategies/tree/decentraland/landworks-rents/src/strategies/decentraland-landworks-rents).\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nIn order the proposal to become active, here are the steps that need to be implemented:\n\nWe think that a member of the Decentraland development team would be great to verify that the snapshot strategy is implemented as expected.\nThen, we will create a Pull Request to the main Snapshot repository.\nOnce the Pull Request has been merged, an admin from the Decentraland Snapshot Space has to enable the strategy.\nLet me know if there are any questions, comments or concerns (@fungibletaco).\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe LandWorks team and landowners community believe every landowner should be allowed to utilize their VP within the Decentraland community. This can be achieved due to the [enacted proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c98bd010-74b1-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556) and we have already prepared [the code (strategy)](https://github.com/EnterDAO/snapshot-strategies/tree/decentraland/landworks-rents/src/strategies/decentraland-landworks-rents) to do so. We believe going through the official proposal process will promote transparency and will allow the strategy to be considered valid and enabled by Decentraland.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The tool will be compatible with major browsers and provide users with a simple and intuitive interface to enable private transactions with a single click.\n\nPraave was born on ETHPrague 2023 and won 4 bounties from AAVE, PWN, Taiko and Mantle on the hackathon and aims to continue its journey by furthering its integration for enhanced privacy within the ETH ecosystem.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n50,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xb0084bf5514A9343Da32EdC6fA3B595dA018F8E4\n\n## Email address\n\npraaveteam@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nPraave seeks to integrate its privacy solution with Decentraland, creating a secure and private experience within the metaverse. This integration will provide significant benefits to Decentraland and its users by addressing key challenges and enhancing the platform's existing projects.1\n\n1.  Privacy-Enabled Virtual Asset Management: Praave's integration will introduce privacy features that protect users' virtual asset ownership and transactions within Decentraland. This ensures that users have full control over their assets while maintaining confidentiality and preventing unauthorized access.\n2.  Anonymous Social Interactions: By integrating Praave, Decentraland can offer users the option of engaging in anonymous social interactions. This enables individuals to connect, communicate, and collaborate without revealing their real-world identities, fostering a more inclusive and expressive metaverse community.\n3.  Enhanced Trading Privacy: Praave's privacy solution will provide Decentraland users with enhanced privacy when engaging in virtual asset trading. Users can conduct transactions with confidentiality, protecting their trading strategies, and minimizing the risk of front-running attacks.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe roadmap for integrating Praave's privacy solution into Decentraland consists of several key milestones.\n\nFirst, we will conduct thorough research and planning to understand the privacy requirements and challenges within the Decentraland ecosystem. This will help us develop a comprehensive plan for implementing privacy features that align with Decentraland's goals and user expectations.\n\nNext, we will focus on the development and deployment of the core smart contracts necessary for integrating Praave's privacy solution with Decentraland. This includes establishing a secure and efficient transaction flow between the two platforms.\n\nOnce the smart contracts are in place, we will proceed with the API integration, ensuring seamless communication and data flow between Decentraland and Praave's privacy protocols.\n\nThe privacy protocol implementation phase will involve integrating the privacy features within Decentraland to safeguard user transactions and interactions. Thorough testing and optimization will be conducted to ensure efficient and secure privacy preservation.\n\nThroughout the process, we will actively engage with the Decentraland community, providing education and support on the integrated privacy solution. We will also launch targeted marketing campaigns to raise awareness and promote the value proposition of privacy in Decentraland.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x7bbea9c18cd0541acab8c19da2b11d0c03faef1c (1Existence)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Recognition of Decentraland DAO's Support by Grant Recipients](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c99ba070-f5c7-11ed-9bc2-e5fe350d0c93)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis Draft Proposal outlines the purpose and the process for adding specific requirements to future grantees, in order to foster Decentraland’s brand and Decentraland DAO's awareness.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to add specific requirements to future Decentraland DAO grant agreements, for recipients to acknowledge the support of the Decentraland DAO. This would help raise awareness of Decentraland's support for innovation and community initiatives, and enhance the platform's reputation. Since there is a separation of Decentraland Foundation and Decentraland DAO, all mention of Decentraland is in regards to the DAO.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nTo enhance recognition and community confidence in Decentraland DAO, we propose that all future grant recipients prominently acknowledge the support they receive. This acknowledgment should be displayed on their websites, marketing materials, or other relevant platforms. Currently, only the Sponsorship category requires brand awareness.\n\nWe also recommend establishing an official social media account for community updates and marketing purposes. This will not only raise awareness of Decentraland's role in supporting innovation but also enhance the platform's visibility and reputation.\n\nWe suggest that these requirements be included in all future Decentraland grant agreements. While the choice of social media platforms—Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.—is at the grantee's discretion, having an active official social media account is recommended. However, it's mandatory for grantees receiving a Social Media grant.\n\nNote: The recommendation for all grantees to have a social media account was suggested during the polling period. After input from the GSS (Grant Support Squad), it was decided to make this a recommendation, not a requirement, except for those receiving Social Media grants.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAs the grantees of Decentraland DAO, it's vital to give due recognition to the support received. This acknowledgment needs to be clear and visible, encompassing a range of communication platforms and mediums. Please note that while acknowledging the support, it must be explicitly stated, as per Decentraland's Terms of Use Policy, that the grantee has no formal association, partnership, or affiliation with Decentraland, the DAO, or the Decentraland Foundation.\n\nGrantees are required to satisfy at least one of the following acknowledgment options:\n\n1.  Website Acknowledgment:\n\n    *   Grantees can exhibit a clear acknowledgment of Decentraland DAO's support on their project's primary website or create a dedicated webpage for the same. This acknowledgment could include:\n        A. The Decentraland logo and a statement expressing gratitude to the DAO for its\\\n        support.\n\n                 For example:\n                \"This project is generously supported by the Decentraland DAO. Visit \n                [https://decentraland.org/] to learn more about their commitment to fostering \n                innovation and creativity within the virtual world.\"\n\nNote: This is only to acknowledge the support given from the Decentraland DAO.\\\nRefer to the Terms of Use policy: https://decentraland.org/brand\n\n               B. About Decentraland: Add a brief description of Decentraland and its  mission, \n                    highlighting its commitment to fostering innovation, creativity, and community \n                    engagement within the virtual world. Provide a hyperlink to Decentraland's \n                    official website, encouraging visitors to learn more about the platform and its \n                    initiatives\n              C. Visuals or Media: If applicable, showcase images or videos of your project that \n                   demonstrate the impact of Decentraland DAO's support, such as event photos, \n                  workshop materials, or other relevant content.\n\n2.  Marketing Materials\n\n    *   If Marketing materials related to the grant-supported project are the chosen method, including press releases, event materials, and promotional content, they should feature the Decentraland logo and an acknowledgment of the grant. This can be included as a footnote, banner, or other appropriate formats.\n\n        (Further Specifications are continued on the Google Document link below.)\n\n3.  Social Media and Public Announcements\n\n    *   Grant recipients should acknowledge the Decentraland DAO’s support in any social media posts or public announcements related to the project. This can be done by tagging Decentraland's official social media accounts and using appropriate hashtags (e.g., #DecentralandGrant). With the exception of categories that require a social media account, grant recipients are encouraged but not required to create and maintain an official social media account for their project, which will be used to update the community, market their project, and support the Decentraland DAO.\n\n    (Further information including some examples can be found on the Google Document link below)\n\n4.  Project Presentations and Events\n\n    (Further information can be found on the Google Document link below)\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe options under items #2, 3, and 4 are continued on the google doc as there is not enough space to the complete the full proposal here.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1jjbIUpzTDOSCEPeXUNGxYk8lGZR3uLJ7vU82YoLuaRU/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nDuring  the grant recipients regular progress reports to the GSS, they should include a summary of how the acknowledgment requirements have been met. This should include links to the website, copies of marketing materials, documentation of any events or presentations where Decentraland's support was acknowledged, and a summary of the project's social media activity. If for any reason a grantee is unable to comply there should be adequate reasoning provided to the satisfaction of the GSS member conducting the review. This decision will be satisfactory to the DAO in good faith.  To underscore, grantees are required to implement at least one of the aforementioned acknowledgment methods. However, you are welcome to adopt more than one method for wider recognition if you so wish.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGrantees will submit to the GSS, in their regular progress reports, a summary of how the chosen acknowledgment requirement has been satisfied. By implementing these requirements for future grant recipients, we can ensure that Decentraland receives appropriate recognition for its contributions to the growth and development of the virtual world. This will not only benefit Decentraland's visibility but also help foster a sense of community and collaboration among the various projects supported by the platform. The use of social media as a tool to support the Decentraland DAO and build community confidence will further strengthen the relationship between grant recipients and the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (LordLike)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Organizational Chart for Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4f53c760-dac0-11ed-a302-91aa98f8d7a4)\n\n## Summary\n\nCreate an Organizational Chart for Decentraland DAO that clearly outlines all its Core Units - teams that provide core infrastructure and operations for the DAO; their roles, interdependencies, and responsibilities within the Decentraland DAO.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nCreating an Organizational Chart for Decentraland DAO will foster transparency, accountability, and a better understanding of the DAO governance structure.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal arises from the need for a clearer understanding of the Decentraland DAO's structure.\n\nAn Organizational Chart will provide a transparent view of the DAO's governance, allowing Community members to easily comprehend the roles and responsibilities of each DAO Core Unit. This will lead to more efficient collaboration, improved accountability, better communication, and the ability to identify and address potential governance gaps.\n\nOrganizational Chart will simplify and streamline DAO’s governance processes, making them more effective and transparent.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n1.  Current and future Decentraland DAO Core Units should communicate between each other and provide the following elements for inclusion in the DAO Organizational Chart:\n\n*   **Core Units:** The chart should identify the various Core Units and their members.\n\n*   **Roles and Responsibilities:** Each DAO Core Unit should provide a comprehensive list of roles and responsibilities, detailing the key functions and activities undertaken by its members.\n\n*   **Reporting Structure:** The chart should illustrate the reporting structure within each Core Unit, specifying the reporting hierarchy and key decision-makers.\n\n*   **Transparent Accountability:** The chart should clearly indicate which Core Units are responsible for each section of the DAO, fostering accountability.\n\n2.  DAO Organizational Chart should be added to the Decentraland DAO Documentation.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe development of a Decentraland DAO Organizational Chart is a step towards a more transparent, accountable, and effective DAO governance structure. This tool will not only benefit the current members and teams within the DAO but will also be instrumental for new members who wish to contribute to the Decentraland DAO's mission and vision. By implementing this proposal, we can ensure a better understanding of our DAO's structure, promote efficient collaboration, enhance accountability, and improve communication within the DAO.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should Decentraland have a default realm and solo mode?",
    "body": "> by 0x5e5d9d1dfd87e9b8b069b8e5d708db92be5ade99 (paralax)\n\nThis proposal builds upon the feedback received in the previous one titled \"Should Decentraland transition to a single realm?\" It incorporates the feedback gathered from various comments and conversations.\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8d531190-0a10-11ee-bb17-db98a4ce871d\n\n### The problem\n\nDecentraland currently operates with multiple realms, presenting a challenge in understanding how to meet other users within the world. To successfully connect with another user, one must understand realms, realms navigation, location coordinates, and the concept of islands or user clusters, all these must match in order for a user to be able to interact with a friend. This fragmentation hinders the platform's potential for social engagement, collaboration, and the sense of a unified metaverse experience. There have been press reports that highlighted instances where high-profile events hosted in Decentraland did not witness expected user numbers or engagement due to participants unintentionally joining realms with a low user base.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe new proposal is to transition from the current 11 realms in Decentraland to a better system that focuses on connecting platform users to enhance social engagement. Additionally, it aims to provide the option for solo users to explore the world individually, allowing them to experience scenes without being inundated by a high volume of users or chat messages.\nWhile transitioning to a default realm would require a new communication service, the commitment is to maintain decentralization by making the service open source and easy to launch, allowing anyone to operate their own realm.\n\nApart from configuring the realm service and moving the comms responsibilities from the Catalyst to the new communications service implementation, it is important to note that the Catalysts nodes will remain fulfilling their role as the decentralized content layer for the platform and ensuring the preservation of the existing decentralized infrastructure.\n\n### How would the default realm work?\n\nUpon joining Decentraland, the existing content download and upload processes will remain intact, utilizing the decentralized catalyst network as it does currently. Additionally, the client will establish a connection with the default realm service, similar to how the chat system operates.\nThe default realm service will group users based on their positions in the world, enabling seamless communication within the groups (aka islands).\nAfter logging in, users will have the option to switch to solo mode. In solo mode, users will have the freedom to navigate the world without being visible to or encountering other users. Furthermore, they will not receive or have access to voice chat or ~nearby chat channels. This mode provides users with the opportunity to experience a solitary exploration, free from the presence of others and without the distractions of real-time communication.\nBy offering both the default realm service for social engagement and the solo mode for independent exploration, Decentraland will be able to provide a flexible and immersive experience tailored to individual user preferences.\n\nIn addition to this, catalyst owners will have the flexibility to utilize either the default realm service or create and integrate their own custom realm service. However, users will initially be directed to the default realm. In order to join a different realm, users will need to perform a manual action (like using the /changrealm command).\n\n### Note about performance\n\nWhile considering the transition to a single realm, individuals expressed concerns regarding lag, performance, and reduced computational power. Adopting a single or a default realm does not imply relying on a single server to handle all platform communications. On the contrary, this approach involves implementing a distributed network of small services that can effectively scale to accommodate the growing user load (the existing catalyst model runs all the services in a single computer). The platform experienced performance could be affected by many factors such as the computer resources, internet connection/congestion, scene implementation, physical distance to the server, client version (web vs desktop) as well as the communication service performance. As of today, the communications service performance is not negatively affecting the platform and the service used for the proposed default realm will remain to be LiveKit, preserving the existing service level experience.\n\n### Decentralization\n\nAnother concern in the comments was about service centralization, it’s important to remember that the platform decentralization comes from the consensus layer and from all the smart contracts and blockchain data. There are several existing services running to support the platform that have a central instance but they are open-source and can be run by anyone. This ensures that the platform and its services can be sustained by any individual if the need arises.\n\n### Benefits\n\n*   Unified and Connected Metaverse: A single realm fosters a more unified and connected metaverse, enabling users to seamlessly interact, collaborate, and engage with each other.\n*   Enhanced User Experience: With a single realm, users no longer have to navigate multiple realms to meet with friends, reducing confusion and complexity. This streamlined experience improves user satisfaction, encourages longer engagement periods, and makes the platform more accessible and appealing to new users.\n*   Simpler and More Accurate Hot-Scenes Calculation: Currently each catalyst node must gather communication information from all nodes in the network and perform its own hot-scenes calculations, resulting in potential delays and slight variations in the data across realms. A single-realm model reduces the number of necessary requests and increases the accuracy and consistency of real-time data.\n*   More scalable solution for the communication service: current implementation hosts all services on a single computer, the catalyst node, which has some physical limitations like the number of concurrent open connections. By adopting this approach, it becomes feasible to scale the communication service by adding additional computers to support more users.\n\n- Create the default realm and solo mode\n- Keep everything as it is\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xfe06daef60ecb07fc65e8a9d0e81b82d93fd884b (jEnnova)\n\nShould the following $117,800 grant in the Sponsorship category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nFULL PROPOSAL: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iNVPASweUI-0vhEqMBXsDGWkT2qeEjnQIZg1Lg7RIiY/edit?usp=sharing\n\nEnnova (Twitter: @ennova_io) recognizes the value of community wear for organizations. As such, we would like to facilitate a 7-month marketing campaign via a phygital t-shirt design contest in DCL. The winning design will become the official DCL phygital t-shirt & be distributed to the community for free worldwide & at an IRL event. The winning design will also be converted to a limited-edition wearable by the designer and developer voted by the community. This initiative will boost DCL’s brand recognition, generate word-of-mouth advertising, & foster unity among the community.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n117,800 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n7 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xfE06DAEF60ecb07Fc65E8a9d0E81B82d93fd884B\n\n## Email address\n\nConcierge@ActivateEnnova.com\n\n## Description\n\nDCL has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact, socialize, & conduct business. It is vital to invest in marketing strategies that promote growth, brand awareness, & new user onboarding to fully realize this potential & remain competitive. Sponsoring this project presents an innovative approach to addressing these objectives.\n\nCost-effective Marketing:\nOur marketing campaign is an affordable & effective marketing strategy. Phygital t-shirts are cost effective & can be produced in large quantities, making it an accessible method to promote DCL globally. When people wear the DCL t-shirt in public, they will be walking billboards for the platform leading to word-of-mouth advertising & increased exposure for DCL. According to a BCG report, word-of-mouth marketing is up to 10x more effective than paid ads. Furthermore, McKinsey & Co reported that the importance of word-of-mouth marketing is only likely to grow with Gen-Zers as 82% of them trust their family & friends for advice on products more than any other source. What better way to empower our community members to market & promote DCL than to give them a product they’d love to wear & leverage to encourage others to join DCL.\n\nEnhanced Brand Recognition & Promotion:\nThe creation & distribution of t-shirts featuring DCL’s logo can significantly boost brand recognition. According to a survey by PPAI, 85% of people remember the brand or business that gave them a branded or promotional product. Ennova will offer these t-shirts to both newly onboarded & existing DCL members effectively creating a network of individuals who will feel further empowered to promote DCL, ultimately increasing its visibility and reach.\n\nInnovative User Experience:\nIncorporating NFC tag technology into the t-shirts offers users a seamless & interactive experience. Scanning the embedded NFC tag can instantly direct them to DCL's website removing barriers to engagement & increasing the likelihood of onboarding new users. This approach will not only attract attention but also demonstrate DCL’s commitment to cutting-edge tech & user experience.\n\nCommunity Building & Engagement:\nOur design contest will foster community involvement & pride, as members contribute their creative skills & participate in voting for the winning design. This sense of belonging can attract new users & lead to an increase of repeat DCL visits from current users. A study by Invesp found that engaged customers visit a website 2x more often & spend 5x longer on a website than non-engaged customers. Studies like this one suggest that when customers are engaged with a brand, they are more likely to spend more time on the website & make more purchases / take other desirable actions.\n\nOffline & In-World Integration:\nThis initiative bridges the gap between the digital & physical worlds by offering both virtual wearables in DCL & t-shirts with NFC tags. This integration will generate interest from a wider audience & create buzz around DCL, showcasing its innovative approach to the metaverse experience.\n\nThis project is beneficial to DCL. It will address current gaps in areas such as new user onboarding, marketing, & community engagement. Furthermore, it will elevate DCL’s brand awareness, drive its further growth in the metaverse market, & showcase its commitment to innovation. Ennova is excited for the opportunity to bring this project to fruition & create something monumental the whole community can be proud of!\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nEnnova will complete this project’s milestones in five (5) phases. We have provided the roadmap containing details about each phase along with a high-level flowchart in Table 1(a).\n\nTable 1(a) Project Flow\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/zGCYtK5.png)\n\nProject Milestone Phases\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/9xaNFFm.png)\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/0CwxhiF.png)\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/M9qdn4y.png)\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/PXX3owg.png)\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/S7PfIiv.png)\n\nTable 1(b) - Designer & Developer Prizes\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/jpIy5fp.png)\n\nTable 1(c) - Wearables Sales Proceeds Distribution\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/oD5PBOi.png)\n\nTable 1(d) - Proposal Highlights\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/7YbmYOk.png)\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Product names should allow newcomers to quickly grasp what the feature offers while pulling them in by being enticing and marketable.\n\nWhy change the name ‘Worlds’?\n\n*   ‘Worlds’ doesn’t accurately communicate what the feature offers: your own personal space. ‘Worlds’ implies something much bigger. It also doesn’t entice, being very basic.\n\n*   The name ‘Worlds’ is used by other metaverse projects. (i.e Spatial: ‘Build your own 3D world in one click’).\n\n*   In day-to-day conversations, the Foundation, DAO, and community refer to anything inside Decentraland as ‘in world’—this is now getting confused with ‘in Worlds’.\n\n*   Other metaverse projects are often referred to as other ‘worlds’.\n\nWhile the name ‘Worlds’ is simple, throughout the feature’s beta period it became clear that it was not the best for marketing purposes, did not accurately describe what the feature is, and was too general. Being in a beta state, the name was always subject to change, and now would be the right time to implement this.\n\nVOTING OPTIONS:\n“YES”: Implement a new name for ‘Worlds’\n“NO”: Leave the name ‘Worlds’ as is\n\nThis is not a vote on what the new name should be, just a vote whether the name itself should be changed. If you vote ‘Yes” and have a suggestion that fits the considerations above, please feel free to share in the Forum. However, please keep in mind that at Decentraland, product names are intended to be descriptive or suggestive, rather than random, made up, or fanciful (i.e Google, Uber) and should be easy for a global audience (non-native English speakers) to understand.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should Decentraland transition to a single realm?",
    "body": "> by 0x5e5d9d1dfd87e9b8b069b8e5d708db92be5ade99 (paralax)\n\n### The Problem\n\nDecentraland currently operates with multiple realms, presenting a challenge in understanding how to meet other users within the virtual world. To successfully connect with another user, one must understand realms, realm navigations, location coordinates, and the concept of islands or user clusters, all these must match in order for a user to be able to interact with a friend. This fragmentation hinders the platform's potential for social engagement, collaboration, and the sense of a unified metaverse experience. There have been press reports that highlighted instances where high-profile events hosted in Decentraland did not witness expected user numbers or engagement due to participants unintentionally joining realms with a low user base.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe proposal is to transition from the current 11 realms in Decentraland to a unified single realm. This initiative aims to address a critical weak point in the platform by significantly improving how users are grouped in the world and removing a layer of complexity caused by the segregation of realms. While transitioning to a single realm would require a new centralized communication service, the commitment is to maintain decentralization by making the single realm service open source and easy to launch, allowing anyone to operate their own realm. On the other hand, the Catalysts will continue to exist and be in charge of managing the decentralized content. The cost of the single realm service will be covered by Decentraland Foundation using the existing LiveKit Cloud solution and might be transferred to the DAO in the future.\nAs this implementation implies protocol changes, it will go through a three-stage governance process.\n\nToday the catalyst nodes have two responsibilities:\n\n*   Decentralized Content Storage: Ensuring the content of Decentraland will be replicated and live forever.\n*   Real-time Communications (Realms): Grouping users, messaging, voicechat, etc.\n\nNowadays a user can only interact with another user connected to the same catalyst.\n\nThe proposed solution is to move the communications service out of the Catalysts nodes to a centralized, highly replicated, service that will receive all platform users' positions and be able to group them based on their location, regardless of the catalyst node that they are using for content management.\n\n![model](https://images2.imgbox.com/c1/4b/wYIys9j8\\_o.png)\n\n### Benefits:\n\n*   Unified and Connected Metaverse: A single realm fosters a more unified and connected metaverse, enabling users to seamlessly interact, collaborate, and engage with each other.\n*   Enhanced User Experience: With a single realm, users no longer have to navigate multiple realms to meet with friends, reducing confusion and complexity. This streamlined experience improves user satisfaction, encourages longer engagement periods, and makes the platform more accessible and appealing to new users.\n*   Cost Reduction for Catalyst Owners: Currently, each node owner must maintain a LiveKit Cloud account or host a LiveKit cluster, incurring infrastructure costs. Transitioning to a single realm eliminates the need for individual node owners to bear these expenses, resulting in cost savings for community members.\n*   Although the solution may appear more centralized, the reality is that most real-time communications are currently managed by a few LiveKit instances. Unifying these instances with the single realm service enables the implementation of the single realm model.\n*   Simpler and More Accurate Hot-Scenes Calculation: Currently each catalyst node must gather communication information from all nodes in the network and perform its own hot-scenes calculations, resulting in potential delays and slight variations in the data across realms. A single-realm model reduces the number of necessary requests and increases the accuracy and consistency of real-time data.\n\n- Transition to a Single realm\n- Keep 11 realms\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

It can be installed with just a few lines of code and once deployed, allows users to share access to their scene dashboard and assign roles.\n\nVLM can currently create images, video screens, and more, then transform them in real time. Video screens can play a live stream and then switch to a looping playlist. Its moderation feature allows you to ban certain users or wearables from entering your scene. An Advanced User role gives developers access to dashboard widgets to build their own custom controls.\n\nBut there’s so much more, and Decentraland is just the beginning...\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x01d871870CbBddE934526E17637c0cfEf0b3b38B\n\n## Email address\n\nunknower@vlm.gg\n\n## Description\n\nVLM allows users to manage aspects of their scene in real time that would normally be a pain point for people regularly holding events in Decentraland. It can also free up time for our small group of skilled developers building compelling experiences in Decentraland, by letting them hand off certain controls to their clients and collaborators.\n\nQuick Feature Highlights:\n\n*   Scene Analytics\n*   Live transformations (move,scale,rotate,hide,show,etc)\n*   Easily configurable dynamic video screens (switch between live streams or switch to looping pre-recorded video playlists)\n*   Images and NFTs can be placed in your scene and assigned different click actions, such as opening an external URL, moving a player in the scene, playing a sound, or teleporting the player out.\n*   More advanced developer-friendly tools and controls for those comfortable with light coding - create your own controls!\n\nThese features are built out and ready to go! VLM is currently open to user signups at www.vlm.gg\nVirtual Land Manager will be available to release to the public within the next few weeks.\nThis proposal will allow VLM to go without building a payment system for now, so it will be able to open up to free use by the community within a week of this proposal passing.\n\nA more extensive presentation of this proposal's objectives can be found in PDF form here:\nhttps://vlm-downloads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/daogrant.pdf\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nAll of the key features are already built out, but the longer form PDF has a list of all features that will be available at launch, as well as a list of key futures planned for development in the future. This grant covers the development of VLM retroactively, and covers the costs of future use of the platform for creators in Decentraland.\n\nView the PDF proposal here:\nhttps://vlm-downloads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/daogrant.pdf\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The primary objective of this increased social media coverage is an increase of new users to the platform and raising awareness about the opportunities Decentraland has to offer.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n18,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x74379e9AEB6a45C9Cb9E5399551D93EEF2A31Fd3\n\n## Email address\n\nwhoskameyo@naver.com\n\n## Description\n\nDecentraland represents the future of the metaverse: a platform where users can experience amazing games, engage in a user-driven economy (Fashion~!), and explore their own imaginations through the act of creating their own content. It is a truly innovative platform, but is plagued by a startling lack of quality coverage on social media.\n\nThere are already many fun games and activities to experience on Decentraland, if we can showcase them to the world we should be able to see a significant increase in the number of users. I plan on using the funding provided by this grant to produce quality content centred around exploring the best of what Decentraland has to offer. By heightening Decentraland’s social media presence we should see a direct increase in the number of active users on the platform.\n\nI mainly specialise in community management and viral growth (primarily on YouTube, Discord, TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter). I’ve worked on both increasing growth in pre-established communities, as well as building up new communities from scratch. I also have experience conducting growth campaigns through the production of viral videos (example below).\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOver the course of this grant I’ll be focusing on creating content about exploring a new Decentraland experience each week. These adventures will make up the bulk of produced content, providing viewers (and potential users) with a first-hand look at Decentraland’s gameplay! Here’s a quick list of  some of the content I plan to cover:\nGenesis Plaza (DCL’s entry experience)\nWondermine\nICE Poker Stronghold\nSoul Magic\nVroomway\nWilderness P2E\nButterfly Prawn Farm\nMeta GamiMall\nKnights of Antrom\n\nSo far, these experiences have been identified as the best Decentraland has to offer; If you want your content to be showcased in front of my audience, please either drop a comment below and I’ll consider it for future videos!\n\nYoutube: Shorts: 6 per week, total 54, Video (8m): 1 per week, total 9\nInstagram: Posts: 3 per week, total 27, Reels: 3 per week, total 27\nTikTok: Shorts: 3 per week, total 27\nTwitter: Posts: 6 per week, total 54\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The primary purpose of this center is to empower creators to interact, co-create, and learn about Decentraland. Here is a floor plan of the MEC: https://bit.ly/43W1sYq.\n\nOur initiative aims to make DCL accessible to a new generation of talented creators interested in cutting-edge technologies. Our main goal is not only to stimulate content creation for DCL but also to facilitate 'phygital' events. These include educational workshops, interactive exhibits, and dedicated spaces for creation.\nBy offering this resource, we hope to inspire and educate our community, fostering a culture of innovation and creativity that will shape the future of DCL.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n40,200 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xADF154A28f1596C34a3302c846279514429eddF4\n\n## Email address\n\nandres.fonseca@itrmachines.com\n\n## Description\n\nSince establishing **Espacio Creador DAO** (https://escreador.wtf/), we have collaborated with Latin American creators to democratize access to web3 and Decentraland. A year of co-creation with various artists from the region has highlighted **experiential learning** as the most effective way to ensure accessibility.\n\nOver the past year, we've successfully **hosted phygital events and activities:** https://bit.ly/43RjI5p,  Leveraging this experience, we propose the development of a Metaverse Experience Center (MEC) in Bogotá, Colombia, to DCL DAO. The center will serve as a hub for promoting web3, Decentraland, and related merchandise. We recognize the symbiosis of fashion and technology as a driving force for adopting virtual worlds.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that a fully equipped MEC is resource-intensive, our extensive experience with phygital events equips us to develop the initial iteration of the MEC. This first phase will allow us to gauge engagement from Latin American creators and measure the retention of these creators in Decentraland. Our primary goal is to educate future designers on developing Decentraland scenes and wearables, while offering an engaging **phygital space for newcomers to explore and learn about Decentraland**.\n\nThe MEC project promises to be a dynamic space for individuals to learn about, interact with, and contribute to Decentraland. By bridging the physical and virtual worlds, the MEC will champion user adoption, content creation, and community development in the region.\n\nKey features of the MEC will include:\n\n*   **Educational Workshops:** Regular workshops introducing users to Decentraland, and its suite of tools and resources for crafting unique content and experiences.\n\n*   **Interactive Exhibits:** An immersive showcase of the latest developments, art, and applications within the Decentraland ecosystem, facilitated by DCL VR. https://sidequestvr.com/app/11626.\n\n*   **Creation Spaces:** Dedicated areas for artists and developers to collaborate, innovate, and generate fresh content for Decentraland, equipped with essential tools, software, and hardware.\n\n*   **Networking and Events:** Regular meetups, hackathons, and other community events to stimulate networking and collaboration among Decentraland users, creators, and enthusiasts.\n\nWe are excited to forge partnerships with local institutions like Universidad Nacional de Colombia https://bogota.unal.edu.co/  and Uniminuto https://www.uniminuto.edu/, as well as businesses like Casa Taller, Taller de Diseño http://www.tallerdediseno.com/ and VIIO https://viio.me/, to spread awareness and catalyze adoption. **The MEC will serve as a lively venue for regular events, workshops, and meetups to foster community engagement.**\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Design (Month 1-2)**\n\n*   Planing: Weeks (W) 1-2 Develop project charter and establish clear objectives, deliverables, and timelines. Definition of the AR interactions of Espacio Creador x DCL Collection for promoting DCL thought tech-fashion.\n\n*   Site Selection and Design: W 3-4 Negotiate lease terms and finalize venue selection. Begin initial design and layout plans for the MEC, including areas for workshops, exhibits, creation spaces, and events.\n\n*   Procurement Planning: W 5-6 Identify Source vendors and obtain quotes for equipment.

In this regard, we intend to introduce a monthly  program dubbed, metaverse summit, a program  with the aim of enabling young Africans, especially students, dvelopers, enthusiasts and entrepreneurs to identify and explore the opportunities that are available to them in the metaverse ,\nThe metaverse  narrative, though an emerging technology has a lot of potential and opportunities for students, entrepreneurs and more especially the African community in helping curb unemployment deficits.  it’s our conviction that, awareness creation and the on-boarding of students at the grass root level through education would be a significant starting point for the early adoption of decentraland by individuals, artists and businesses, with the aim helping them provide solutions that meets local expectations. In Africa, metaverse hasn’t gained much attention in spite of its huge potential and the significant impact it could make in the life of many startups, developers, artists and the continent at large, in terms of providing real time solutions that addresses the challenges that confront the continent we intend to work very hard to reduce this\n\nSTRATEGY FOR IMPLEMENTATION\nThe plan is to organize two  events, an in person event  and setting up a decentraland twitter channel for Africa, The first part of the initiative will be the in person event.. The expectation is that, by the in person event, we’ll establish campus decetraland  representatives. With this initiative, we are focused on educating and onboarding students and people in attendance  in to decentraland and  metaverse.the event will focus on\n\n•\tIntroduction to metaverse\n•\tWhat is metaverse\\\n•\tintro to decentraland and how to create an account\n•\tHow to create buy and sell on decentraland\n\nThe key to the success of this project is to partner with existing student communities and associations that will help us get a foot in the door. We then hope that the value proposition of decentraland  will be enough to make them want to learn more. We have already established relationships with a few associations in varrious universities and are discussing details for the events. Taking into account the audience for our program, we will have to create interesting and insightful content with this specific targets in mind. After catching their initial interests at our events, we need to continue to provide opportunities to keep them actively engaged in the community and learn more about the community. Allowing everyone to participate to the best of their ability, at whatever level they are starting from. we intend to hold these events in Enugu state University of science andTech, federal university of Technology owerri\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\na total of 2 events that will have atleast 50-80 people in attendance in each of the event.\nevent pictures and contacts of attendees\nsummary report and feedbacks\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This will enhance user engagement with Decentraland, attract new users, and provide opportunities for the Community to participate and earn rewards.\n\nTo execute this initiative, the DAO will need a diverse team of professionals with expertise in areas such as software and blockchain development, game design, economics, smart contract programming, product management, and legal consulting.\n\nThis team will be tasked with developing interactive games and activities, managing and maintaining the project, as well as formulating marketing and financial strategies for both the short and long term to attract users and generate revenue.\n\nThe primary deliverables will include the design, development, and deployment of the platform, complete with a variety of games (cards, etc.) and potentially a casino.\n\nThe project will also involve creating user manuals, technical and legal documentation, and a comprehensive marketing and financial strategy to attract users to these new services.\n\nIt is mandatory to provide a detailed plan outlining the revenue generation mechanism, its distribution to benefit the DAO, and the reward system for Community participation.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nThe intended users of the proposed solution are diverse Community members. This includes, but is not limited to, gamers, streamers, content and wearable creators, DAO voters and delegates, developers, blockchain enthusiasts, and crypto-traders.\n\nThese users require an easy-to-use, decentralized entertainment portal, a transparent system of operations (game mechanics), and fair rewards programs to participate in building the Decentraland virtual economy and spend time in an engaging and interesting manner.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nBuilding and maintaining a Decentraland DAO-Owned Gaming and online Gambling Space will benefit both the DAO and Decentraland by:\n\n1.  Attracting a new user base\n2.  Ensuring long-term financial sustainability for the DAO\n3.  Distributing participation rewards to Community members\n4.  Stimulating the growth of the DCL virtual economy\n\nThe project will be entirely DAO-governed, reinforcing the principle of Community ownership and ensuring all generated revenue is reallocated into the DAO.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

However, many users do not and never will publish wearables because they do not have enough knowledge in 3D modeling.\n\nWe will encourage the creation of wearables by creating an add-ons repository to facilitate the creation of new original designs with add-ons that can be attached to each other, which will serve as a stimulus for those who do not know how to model in 3D.\n\nThis repository will consist of 800 add-ons for the upper body, lower body and feet categories. The add-ons will be assembled together automatically, so that the user will be able to easily create a wearable avoiding all the difficulties that a 3D modeler has in its initial stages, this will increase the incentive for users without knowledge in 3D modeling to create wearables.\n\nThis repository of 800 add-ons allows multiple possibilities for the near future if the community decides to complement it or continue working on it:\n\n*   Add the remaining categories to create fully functional VRM avatars and skins.\n*   Develop an app/graphical interface to further facilitate the construction of wearables.\n*   Expand it to increase the possibilities of customization.\n\nProblem:\n\nCreators prefer other platforms over Decentraland.\n\nThe fact that the user base on Decentraland is not growing is because new users have no incentive to join or stay on the platform.\n\nThe bigger issue is that many of them would want to build, and would do so in Decentraland if it were easy, however building in the metaverse mostly requires knowledge of 3D modeling, something that is an insurmountable barrier to entry for those who have never used software like Blender, possibly more than 99% of potential users.\n\nThe proof that reflects this is that there are thousands of 2D image NFT projects that do not require advanced knowledge of any software, the success of this is because creating a 2D NFT is easy, while creating a wearable in Decentraland is difficult.\n\nSolution:\n\nFacilitating the creation of wearables with a system of add-ons that can be easily assembled together, we will be able to encourage new users to create in Decentraland.\n\nBenefits:\n\n*   Attract new creators.\n*   Facilitate the creation of original wearables for users.\n*   More income for the DAO through curator fees.\n\nTo know the details of this project you can read the following document: https://fastupload.io/fEoba6q45Wfn8Re/preview\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMonth 1:\n\n*   It will focus on the creation and adaptation of the first meshes, which will be used as a base to develop the final meshes from which add-ons will come. The meshes will be given position, size and other characteristics so that they fit with each other automatically without incident when imported.\n\nMonth 2:\n\n*   The color palettes will be selected to be applied in the final UV texture of the meshes according to the quality parameters specified in the “Project Specifications.pdf” document.\n*   The designs will be developed and the 80 final meshes will be created that will allow the creation of the 800 add-ons.\n\nMonth 3:\n\n*   The colors will be implemented in each of the add-ons.\n*   The 800 generated add-ons will be published as a public repository available to the entire community.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Grant Support Squad (GSS) Guidelines and Accountability Framework | Revocation Trial.",
    "body": "> by 0xed0e0cb94f60f72ec94bef848f5df4cbd365af1d (InJesterr)\n\n**Empowering grants, safeguarding dreams: Uniting the GSS and Grantees through a proposal that secures trust, support, and a brighter future.**\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to establish a set of rules and guidelines for the Grant Support Squad (GSS) within the Decentraland DAO. The GSS's primary responsibility is to support grant recipients and ensure accountability & support for their work. However, there have been concerns about the GSS's approach to granting dilemmas and potential manipulation in a subjective manner in the process of proposing revocations. This proposal aims to address these concerns and create a fair and transparent framework for the GSS's operations.\n\nUnleashing the power of grants while fostering trust and support, this proposal establishes a robust set of rules. Designed to protect both the Grant Support Squad (GSS) and future grantees, it ensures that the GSS acts solely as a supportive entity and not a source of dilemmas. By implementing these rules, the proposal aims to eliminate concerns of demolition and foster a harmonious relationship, safeguarding the dreams and aspirations of all involved parties.\n\n**Grant Dilemmas and Revocation Process:**\n\n**a.** The GSS shall only raise dilemmas and propose revocations after a grant proposal has been passed.\n\n**b.** During the revocation process, the grantee shall have the opportunity to present their case and defend themselves, similar to a court proceeding.\n\n**c.** The GSS shall clearly communicate to the grantee that the suggestion to revoke their grant is only a suggestion, and they will build a formal proposal for revocation if deemed necessary.\n\n**Documentation Required for Grant Revocation:**\n\n**a.** Reason: The GSS must provide a clear and detailed explanation of the reasons for considering a grant revocation. This explanation should be objective, specific, and focused on the grantee's failure to meet the agreed-upon objectives or fulfill the grant requirements.\n\n**b.** Objective Evidence: The GSS must provide verifiable evidence that supports their claims of the grantee's failure to meet the required standards. This evidence should be transparent and accessible to all DAO members.\n\n**c.** Solution for Grant Continuation: In addition to raising concerns and proposing revocation, the GSS should also suggest alternative solutions for the grantee to continue their work, such as recommending modifications to the project plan or offering additional support.\n\n**Training and Accountability:**\n\n**a.** The GSS members should undergo comprehensive training to understand their roles, responsibilities, and the ethical considerations involved in their work.\n\n**b.** The GSS shall be accountable for their actions and decisions. They should be transparent about their activities, providing regular updates and reports to the DAO community regarding their assessments, dilemmas, and revocations.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nBy implementing these guidelines and accountability measures, the Decentraland DAO can ensure a fair and transparent process for grant support and accountability. This proposal aims to establish clear rules for the GSS, promoting effective collaboration between grant recipients and the GSS while protecting the integrity and objectivity of the grant evaluation process.\n\n**PROCESS**\n\n**Process for Executing the Proposal:**\n\nThe Grant Support Squad (GSS) follows a transparent process for grant revocations within the Decentraland DAO. They create a proposal on the governance page, providing reasons, evidence, and a solution. The proposal link is posted under the grantee's passed proposal for visibility. If it passes the GSS is allowed to pass it to The Revocation Committee that reviews the proposal. further steps are taken; if not, the GSS can retry after a 1 month period. This process ensures clear communication and community involvement in the decision-making process.\n\n**(GSS) Proposal Requirements:**\n\n**a.** The GSS provides first a reason in their proposal and explain more about their reason.\n\n**b.** The GSS provides objective evidince to the case and the DAO community will be the jury to judge in the proposal.\n\n**c.** The GSS initiates communication with the grantee to discuss the dilemma and explore potential solutions.\n\n**d.** The GSS identifies a dilemma or issue with a grant recipient, such as possible solutions they can come up with or fulfill grant requirements.\n\n**e.** The Grantee gets a chance to elaborate in the comments explaining on what went wrong or allowed to defend them selves in Revoke proposal! If the Grantee (Defendant) in this case fails to respond at all in this proposal, it passes directly to the revocation comittee.\n\n**Communication with Grant Recipient:**\n\n**a.** The GSS engages in open and transparent communication with the grantee, presenting their concerns and discussing possible resolutions.\n\n**b.** The grantee has the opportunity to provide their perspective, address the concerns raised, and propose alternative solutions.\n\n**Proposal Creation:**\n\n**a.** The proposal outlines the reason for considering revocation, presents objective evidence supporting the claim, and suggests a solution for the grantee to continue their work if applicable.\n\n**Revocation Committee Review:**\n\n**a.** The proposal for revocation is submitted to the DAO as an pre- proposal, which consists of designated members within the Decentraland DAO.\n\n**b.** When the proposal passes and the GSS & Grantee didn't come to a conclusion together, The Revocation Committee reviews the proposal, assesses the evidence presented, and considers the potential impact on the grantee and the DAO community.\n\n**c.** If the proposal passes the review by the Revocation Committee, further steps will be taken as outlined in the proposal. If the proposal does not pass, it is not considered for revocation at this time.\n\n**Retry Period:**\n\n**a.** If the proposal for revocation does not pass, the GSS is allowed to retry submitting a new proposal for revocation after a defined period, such as one month.\n\n**b.** During this retry period, the GSS can continue engaging with the grantee to seek alternative resolutions or gather additional evidence if necessary.\n\n**Ongoing Monitoring and Support:**\n\n**a.** Regardless of the revocation decision, the GSS continues to monitor the progress of the grantee's work, providing support and guidance as needed.\n\n**b.** The GSS maintains regular communication with the grantee and the DAO community, providing updates on the situation and addressing any concerns or questions that may arise.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Understanding and Improving the Governance Participation in Decentraland",
    "body": "> by 0x7ace0b7a0cfb2980aa25310af5c2602144d58db2\n\nShould the following $15,000 grant in the Core Unit category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nDealing with voter fatigue and finding the right onboarding incentives are points of struggle for every DAO. The fact that DAOs do not have any information on their non-participating members makes the puzzle harder. DeepDAO believes that it is possible to understand $MANA token holders down to their interest categories and activity patterns to point toward measures to improve voter participation.\nWe propose conducting a data-based segmentation of $MANA token holders to find out the largest segments of non-voters, voters with decaying participation scores, etc. to point toward the right onboarding steps/incentives.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n15,000 USD in MANA\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n2 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x5D631124f3051f296688ff4BB118fcf15C3eB217\n\n## Email address\n\naman@deepdao.io\n\n## Description\n\nGovernance activity in different DAOs provides valuable insights into the characteristics and preferences of wallet holders. It serves as a window into their interests, motivations, and potential contributions.\n\nFor example, taking a closer look at 0xjean.eth (https://deepdao.io/user/0x6687c671980e65ebd722b9146fc61e2471558dd6/verified_dao_experience), we observe a strong inclination towards identity products(from participation in DAOs like Proof of Humanity, Sismo, etc.) and Public Goods (from participation in DAOs like UBI DAO, Gitcoin, etc). This presents an opportunity for some other DAO 0xjean.eth is a member of to leverage this interest by introducing DAO participation badges or an initiative focused on public goods. These tangible incentives can not only recognize and reward active participants like 0xjean.eth but also serve as a magnet for other enthusiasts with similar interests, encouraging their engagement and involvement in the DAO's decision-making processes.\n\nSimilarly, we can identify other categories of mass interest and introduce new initiatives to the DAO. For instance, if there is a substantial segment of members expressing interest in data analysis or research, establishing a dedicated research guild could be a strategic move. Having understood that the 100s of $MANA token holders are looking for gig work, the DAO could open more avenues for contribution for these people.\n\nThis proposal aims to create interest and activity-based segmentation of $MANA token holders so that the DAO can find methods to retain and onboard new addresses to Decentraland DAO’s governance. Armed with this knowledge, Decentraland DAO can optimize its governance processes, create better onboarding flows, prioritize new initiatives, and foster a more vibrant and engaged community.\n\nNote that we aren’t directly incentivizing governance participation but trying to introduce genuine initiatives that make participation more attractive and more useful to a wider audience.\n\nMethodology\n\nA very high-level plan of action for analyzing the 320k+ $MANA token holders:\n\n(1) Get the DAO resumes of all $MANA token holders (granular activity & memberships), as aggregated by DeepDAO\n\n(2) Based on (1): Label each address’s interest (NFTs, DeFi, Investments, Gaming, gig work, etc.) “Interest” is defined as membership or activity in a DAO category over a threshold. Label their activity on Decentraland DAO (persistent voter, long-term dormant address, non-voter, an address that used to participate, an address that is getting less interested in participating over time, and more)\n\n(3) Repeat step 2 with different interest/activity categories to optimize the segmentation. We now have a well-segmented view of $MANA token holders with info on how large each segment is.\n\n(4) Label bots & vote miners: recent research by DeepDAO identified voting miners’ activity across the DAO ecosystem. We use this data to check for malicious actors.\n\n(5) Based on DeepDAO’s domain expertise in Web3 and governance, work with Decentraland DAO to define the right incentives/onboarding steps for each segmented group.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nDeliverables\n\n(1) A report with analysis of all governance participants of Decentraland DAO and non-active $MANA holders. This will answer questions like who are the primary participants, which are the largest segments of active, and inactive participants, which segments have the highest attrition/retention, etc.\n\n(2) A CSV file with all $MANA token holders and their category interests, as reflected by the DAOs they vote in.\n\n(3) Based on (1) & (2), a brainstorming session with Decentraland DAO to come up with an action plan to onboard inactive segments of voters. One such step could be introducing NFT badges if we discover a large number of people who are interested in NFTs or starting guilds if we discover a segment of users that are looking for gig work.\n\nMilestone 1:\nDeepDAO dives deeper into $MANA holders and finalizes the optimal labels & interest categories.\nTime required: 4 weeks from the start of the project\n\nMilestone 2:\nDeepDAO hands over deliverables (1), (2) & (3)\nTime required: 2 weeks from Milestone 1 completion\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

But hold up, there's a problem with how things are rollin'! The selection process is flawed, the costs are sky-high, and the chances of success are slimmer than a toothpick. It's time for a change, my friends!\n\n🚀 The Challenges We're Tackling:\nLet's talk numbers, folks. The current accelerator and incubator selection process? It's a tough nut to crack, with a dismal conversion rate of only 0.3%. Yup, you heard that right—99.7% of projects get left out in the cold without any support or guidance. And the costs? Woah, they're hefty! We're talking about 6% equity and 6% of the total token supply, sucking the life out of startups' tokenomics.\n\n⚡ Our Solution: XFounders to the Rescue!\nWe're XFounders, and we're here to change the game. Our mission? To skyrocket the statistical likelihood of startups making it to incubation, acceleration, and fundraising. No more leaving 99.7% of projects behind, my friends. We believe that by empowering more projects with a deep understanding of web3 dynamics, we can unleash a storm of hypotheses, launch a fleet of kickass products, ditch the weak models, and develop sustainable business models at warp speed!\n\n💪 An Inclusive Approach:\nWe're not about exclusivity and gatekeeping. Our program is all about inclusivity, accessibility, and building a community of founders, developers, and web3 specialists. We want everyone to have a shot at success, regardless of their background or connections.

    "body": "> by 0x1e105bb213754519903788022b962fe2b9c4b263 (BayBackner)\n\nShould the following $2,025 grant in the Social Media Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\n32 leading 3D artists will be onboarded to DCL for MESH, the art fair for MESH, the art fair for 3D, metaverse and VR creators. Additional artists will require support as they onboard for Metaverse Art Week 2023.\nWe propose that a community-led team provides these artists with direct technical support via Discord. This support will fill the gaps in current creator documentation by running support ‘FAFO’ sessions, Q\\&As and creating video tutorials in direct response to artist questions.\n\nAll content will be published to Youtube to make the onboarding and creation process far easier for all artists. The goal is to accelerate adoption of DCL in the wider 3D art community.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n2,025 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n1 month\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xE1eEdbd1e08478707C794e7e8B1EE623f5fa6D64\n\n## Email address\n\nbay@vueltta.com\n\n## Description\n\nA grant to fund three active DCL members to provide tech & content support for international 3D artists. These artists will create new works in Decentraland for [MESH, the art fair for 3D, metaverse and VR creators](https://meshfair.com/) and for Metaverse Art Week 2023. Both will be held 19-23 July 2023.\n\nMESH and MVAW23 are being produced this year by [Vueltta](https://vueltta.com/), the arts collective behind DCL installations like The Labyrinth Effect (MVAW22) and Dear Vivienne (MVFW23).\n\nOur goals for both MESH and MVAW23 are:\n\n*   To fully onboard 30+ new high-level creators to DCL.\n*   To showcase the creative opportunities available to artists in DCL.\n*   To provide exceptional, new art experiences to the DCL community.\n*   To position DCL as an innovator within the contemporary art world.\n\n72 artists entered the [MESH Open Call](https://www.zealous.co/meshartfair/opportunity/MESH-3D-Metaverse-VR-Art-Fair/) for applications and 100 drafted submissions. Now 32 will be selected for MESH and will be onboarded to DCL for the MESH art fair in July.\n\nWhen we trialled the MESH concept with six 3D artists this May, it was clear that creators needed guidance in addition to the  [MESH Artist Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kMxhE15lj4ja4gQm9opDFlW7cHJ6b5dT/view) and DCL Documentation. Without support, MESH artists may fail to overcome technical difficulties while creating for DCL - and therefore disengage with the platform.\n\nIn our own requests for support as creators, we have been enormously impressed by the Community Building Decentraland (CBD) Discord, especially the live FAFO sessions, rapid answers to our questions, and Youtube ‘How To’ videos on topics such as Worlds. We therefore feel that this community can best provide guidance and content for MESH and MVAW artists this year.\n\nWe hope to gain DAO backing so that we can fund three active community members for 10 hours per week (each) in a Mentor role. All guidance content created will be opened to the community and to future onboarding artists.\n\nGuidance content created will include:\n\n*   Twice weekly FAFO sessions (live technical support)\n*   Youtube videos on recurring artist questions such as ‘How can I add URL links to my installation?’ ‘How can I stream video?’\n\nIn addition, the three MESH Mentors will commit the 10 hours each week to answer artists’ questions and address their concerns. They will answer these questions and compile both questions and answers into a public FAQ for creators.\n\nThe MESH channel and educational content will be hosted by the CBD Discord to aid everyone in the community in building DCL. However CBD will not be receiving any monetary compensation from the grant. The funding will go to the three individual community members for their month-long support and content creation roles.\n\nWe see this as a great test case, in this ‘The Year of The Creator’, to see how artists can use DCL to create engaging new works. DCL’s current documentation does not fully support this creativity - artists need additional help and guidance.\n\nWe also believe that the opportunity to engage with DCL community members via CDB will help artists appreciate how DCL differs from other virtual worlds. Our goal is that each MESH artist will have positive associations with DCL and become advocates for the platform in the 3D community, as we (Vueltta) have become.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n13th June\n\n*   32 creators are selected for MESH. All begin to create their new DCL installations based on their proposals\n\n14th June\n\n*   CBD opens a dedicated Discord support channel for these creators, and all further artists onboarding for MVAW23\n\nFrom 14th June\n\n*   Eight x Weekly FAFO sessions run within the CDB Discord. The exact time of day and days of the week may vary depending on the time zones where the artists reside.\n*   Four x Youtube videos on key artist questions\n*   Daily Q\\&As via the Discord channel, responding to artists questions within hours as they develop their installations\n    30 hours total per week on artist support and content\n\n14th July\n\n*   All installations are deployed for a preview at NFT Show Europe\n*   The support program closes with a comprehensive FAQ of artist questions, which can potentially be used as a key for documentation improvements.\n\n19th - 23rd July\n\n*   MESH and MVAW23 are live\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x270722b5222968603e4650c3b70a7dfb971ed5b6 (frantufro)\n\nLast week we released [2dcl](https://2dcl.org), a 2D alternative client experiment for Decentraland funded by the DAO.\n\nThe development was not without challenges, but we made it. You can read out [last grant's update](https://governance.decentraland.org/update/?id=20db6dd0-f59f-11ed-9bc2-e5fe350d0c93) for more details.\n\nThe original vision is that of creating a whole ecosystem of tools that will aid people of different technological levels to develop content for Decentraland.\n\nThe experiment proved that this can be achieved, but there's a lot of work ahead. This cannot be achieved, for now, without DAO support.\n\nI wanted to open up the discussion to the community to know if you think a follow-up proposal makes sense.\n\nHere are some things that identified that need to happen:\n\n1.  Integrating the client with metamask for login and deployment (currently deployment is done through the official `dcl` sdk command).\n2.  Creating a drag and drop editor to simplify scene creation.\n3.  Evaluate the use of ECS7 vs. a custom scripting SDK for 2D. Implement interactivity through 2D-specific components.\n4.  Visual-programming tool integration. (Think Unreal engine Blueprints)\n5.  Creation of avatar-less experiences.\n\nThese will take a lot of effort to get done, and we estimate this will be more than two years of work. That's why we're wondering if you'd prefer a one-year grant or multiple smaller ones.\n\nI'd like to hear your ideas and suggestions too, not only a yes/no response to the question if possible. Please commend down below if there's any feature you'd like to see.\n\nOur goal is to create a new grant proposal in the coming weeks, with your input taken into account.\n\nThanks!\n\n- Yes, as a year-long project\n- Yes, as a series of smaller grants (3/4mo)\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Chain Challenger: Bridging Web2 players to DCL, a gaming discovery platform.",
    "body": "> by 0x5a1d993ff6e67aa214880c87b46255ea32e24139 (Leonard)\n\nShould the following $105,000 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nDecentraland's website traffic is currently dominated by English-speaking countries. However, China, Japan, and South Korea have a massive gaming market with over 70 billion gamers. Chain Challenger's mission is to connect Web3 games and metaverse projects with billions of Web2 gamers from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea. They plan to create a localized game wiki page, attract players through unique tournaments, and reduce barriers for Asian gamers. With Decentraland DAO's support, Chain Challenger aims to expand DCL's brand awareness and introduce new users in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n105,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x5A1d993fF6E67aA214880C87B46255Ea32E24139\n\n## Email address\n\ncharles.cheng886@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nDue to the character limit, please visit the following link for the complete proposal:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1PYW7yCFUtZC7Rdr4ZzFbCMxxPtE9p4yp/view?usp=sharing\n\nThe first version of Chain Challenger was successfully launched on May 26, 2023, along with a 'Stadium Grand Opening' event that took place from May 26, 2023, to June 2, 2023. For more information, please refer to the links provided below.\n\nChain Challenger Official Website: https://chainchallenger.xyz/\nEvent Page: https://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=645a01af-9347-4654-b889-ffc809e8a7d0!\n\nAny project in DCL can apply to become a partner of Chain Challenger and gain exposure on the Chain Challenger website, especially in the Asian region. In the next version update, the Chain Challenger website will also add an interface for DCL, providing a better connection between DCL's ecosystem and external Web2 Gamers.\n\nChain Challenger's backend uses Strapi, the leading open-source headless CMS, which can provide a flexible and adaptable homepage framework for projects on DCL. This allows different projects to customize the categories and content that need to be included on their project pages according to their own needs, and to best meet the needs of different projects. At the same time, we will also provide free Chinese, Korean, and Japanese localization services for all our partner projects.\n\nIn addition, the 'Dual-Tournament Model' is another innovative and very important feature of Chain Challenger. Currently, most metaverse or blockchain gaming projects often fail to attract a large number of Web2 players during their promotions. The reasons behind this include: (1) friction generated when creating blockchain wallets, (2) stereotypical impressions of Web3 projects (surveys show that the vast majority of Web2 players still believe that NFTs or cryptocurrencies are Ponzi schemes), and (3) the learning curve of switching to new games - a problem that many project teams have overlooked, but is very important.\n\nAccording to Unity's report on multiplayer games in 2022 (https://create.unity.com/multiplayer-report-2022), a game's genre is the most important factor (>46%) for players when choosing a new game. In other words, players of multiplayer games develop a \"stickiness\" to the genres they love, just like how if legendary League of Legends player Faker were to choose a new game to play, he would be more inclined to choose Dota 2, another MOBA game, rather than PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, an FPS game.\n\nChain Challenger utilizes a Dual-Tournament Model to match DCL games with popular Web2 games of similar genres, creating a \"mirror game.\" Separate reward pools are set up, with the DCL game offering larger rewards to boost conversion rates. For instance, Soul Magic, a casual simulation game, can be mirrored with LINE Brown Farm, a popular Web2 game in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Promotions and advertisements targeting LINE Brown Farm communities will attract players who will be enticed by the larger rewards in Soul Magic, increasing the likelihood of them trying the game.\n\nFurthermore, our team has formed strategic partnerships with multiple Web2 and Web3 gaming communities and projects originating from China, Japan, and Korea. These projects will be sequentially launched on Chain Challenger, opening up potential cross-project collaboration opportunities for projects on DCL.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nChain Challenger and Soul Magic hosted the Grand Stadium Opening event on Decentraland from May 26th to June 2nd, 2023. Over 800 users participated in the SpeedRun activity, with nearly 80 players online simultaneously. The event attracted Chinese and Taiwanese gamers through collaborative promotions with projects like Kikitrade, Real Player DAO, and Crypto Pioneer Guild.\n\nFuture Milestones:\n\n1.  Establish independent project pages in five languages for 20 Decentraland projects. Content control will be transferred to the projects, with a backend CRM system allowing customization. See the designs and pages for Soul Magic and The Beacon projects:\n    Soul Magic: https://chainchallenger.xyz/games/Soul%20Magic\n    The Beacon: https://chainchallenger.xyz/games/The%20Beacon\n\n2.  Complete system design for the \"dual-tournament\" feature and organize three major dual-tournament events for Decentraland gaming projects in the next six months. Connections with Taiwan's largest Web2 gaming communities will attract thousands of Traditional Chinese gamers, increasing awareness of Decentraland. The model includes social logins, MPC wallet creation, and fiat-to-crypto services. Refer to the full proposal for visuals.\n\n3.  Develop an SDK and product to enable Chain Challenger users to directly log in and play Decentraland using their MPC wallets, eliminating the need for an additional Metamask wallet. The goal is to onboard Web2 gamers to Web3 games without blockchain or crypto-related knowledge.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x1b35f4d22b2c8bc706bcfcc383a1ca77fb4fc600 (punkpink)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should we offer an add-on repo for fashion creators?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5ead4f30-f346-11ed-9bc2-e5fe350d0c93)\n\n## Summary\n\nRepository of more than 10,000 add-ons that can be assembled with each other, to create wearables in an easy way to attract new creators without knowledge of 3D modeling.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis repository would contain more than 10,000 add-ons that would automatically assemble with each other just by importing them, allowing new talented creators to produce high-quality and 100% functional wearables, without the need for knowledge of 3D modeling.\n\nThis will bring multiple benefits, it will attract new creators to Decentraland, it will facilitate the work of current creators, it will allow people with great talent but without 3D knowledge to start creating in the metaverse, it will increase the income of the DAO.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe creators prefer other platforms over Decentraland.\n\nThe fact that the user base on Decentraland is not growing is because new users have no incentive to join or stay on the platform.\n\nThe most important point is that many of them would want to build, and would do it in Decentraland if it were easy, however building in the metaverse requires mostly knowledge of 3D modeling, something that is an insurmountable barrier to entry for someone who has never used software like Blender, possibly more than 99% of potential users.\n\nThe proof that reflects this is that there are thousands of 2D image NFT projects that do not require advanced knowledge of any software, the success of this is because creating a 2D NFT is easy, while creating a wearable in Decentraland is difficult.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nIn 30 days the DAO receives approximately $20,000 in fees for the new wearables, paying a third of it to the curators and leaving a profit of close to $13,000 each month. However, many users do not and never will publish wearables because they do not have enough knowledge in 3D modeling.\n\nCreating an add-on repository would incentivize creators and new users to create new original designs with add-ons that could be plugged together, which will serve as an encouragement for those who don't know how to model in 3D.\n\nThis repository would consist of two types of add-ons, type 1 (10,000 add-ons) and type 2 (1,250 add-ons), making a total of 11,250 add-ons. The type 1 will be add-ons that can be assembled automatically, so that the user will be able to easily create a wearable avoiding all the difficulties that a 3D modeler has in its initial stages, this will increase the incentive on the part of users without knowledge in 3D modeling to create wearables. Type 2 will be easily assembled add-ons but will require the modification of some of their vertices.\n\nIf there is acceptance by the community, a request for a $126,600 grant will be published to develop this project. For those who wish to learn more about this project, I recommend that you review this document: https://fastupload.io/xKmdZ6AtL4vz8vx/preview\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFacilitating the creation of wearables with a system of add-ons that can be easily assembled together, we will be able to encourage new users to create in Decentraland, achieving the following benefits:\n\n*   Attract new creators.\n*   Facilitate the creation of original wearables for users.\n*   More income for the DAO through the curators fee.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The motivation behind this is the theory that brands may want to create their own NFT stores in Decentraland if they don't have to code almost anything and they can accept $ICE as a payment method.\n\nWhy putting focus on $ICE? Because Decentral Games Poker players are earning this token 24/7 and they can spend it on DG or in... NFT stores!\n\nThe content of the video consists on:\n\na) Why an NFT project should start selling on Decentraland\nb) Where they should publish (DCL Worlds, land (bought/rented))\nc) How to create the store using the builder\nd) How to move the store from the builder to the SDK\ne) How to add DG Live\nf) How to configure the store using DG Live and accept $ICE, Coinbase/Binance payments and credit card\ng) How to deploy (both Genesis City and Worlds)\n\nThe video production process has been underway for the past two weeks, during which I have dedicated my time and efforts to create visually stunning animations using After Effects. The script has been carefully crafted to ensure it is easily understandable by individuals with varying levels of technical knowledge. Moreover, to streamline the store creation process, I have taken the initiative to make Mr. Dhingia Builds (https://unversed.org/wiki/misc/mrdhingia-dhingia-builds/) easily downloadable from my website (with his permission), accompanied by a promotional video to raise awareness (https://twitter.com/unversed_EN/status/1664278130075504643).\n\nI firmly believe that my previous work on Decentraland has demonstrated its value to the platform, and I am confident that this video will be no exception. To access my previous work, kindly visit https://youtube.com/TobikCC. You can see that some of those videos (like the VR one) are being actively watched and recommended by the developers.\n\nWhile I am committed to completing the video regardless, I kindly request financial support to compensate for the considerable time and effort invested in this project. The return on investment for this video is expected to be high, and such support would serve as both motivation for me to continue creating valuable content. In fact, a big portion of this money will be re-invested on upgrading my setup.\n\nRelevant links:\n\nMockups for this video (NOT FINAL RESULT): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFeM7M1EV0g\nVideos I made for DCL brands and foundation: https://tobik.cc/portfolio/\n\nDISCLAIMER: I'm uploading this grant as a content creator, this has nothing to do with my position at the DAO COMMITTEE.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe main video should be finished and uploaded to my channel in 1-2 weeks approx.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should LandWorks landowners keep their VP?",
    "body": "> by 0xd5c2f48d7b69129354473613c07d60106768ccbe (fungibletaco#ccbe)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Should LandWorks landowners keep their VP?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f8d574a0-fafa-11ed-8e4f-8db7948b5171)\n\n## Summary\n\nAllow LandWorks landowners to utilize their VP as at the moment it's locked in the LandWorks protocol.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nAt the moment landowners who have listed their properties for rent on LandWorks cannot utilize their VP as it's locked in the LandWorks protocol. With the recently [enacted proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c98bd010-74b1-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556) by [Nacho](https://governance.decentraland.org/profile/?address=0x87956abC4078a0Cc3b89b419928b857B8AF826Ed) - Decentraland landowners can now keep their VP when listing their properties for rent on the Decentraland Marketplace . This proposal aims to allow LandWorks landowners to keep their VP as well.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe LandWorks landowner community has requested to utilize their VP as they believe they can be more invested in the Decentraland DAO. Therefore this proposal is due to the collective request by the LandWorks landowner community.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n[LandWorks](https://landworks.xyz/) is a metaverse land rental marketplace. It’s a product of EnterDAO and was launched with support for Decentraland in January 2022. Since its inception, LandWorks has supported Decentraland LANDs and ESTATEs rentals and so far has accumulated over [300 rents](https://dune.com/rakis/LandWorks).\n\nThe protocol has been active in the Decentraland community. Last summer LandWorks hosted the [Open Scenes Grant Program](https://landworks.xyz/app/grants-program) where more than $50,000 were rewarded to builders in the Decentraland community for their scene creations. The scenes were also open sources for anyone to use them. We have also purchased a 2x2 ESTATE where we have our [signature scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKZ74OJnwvI) which has already hosted [two parties](https://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=f6480837-0a94-4ac9-bb14-77c294ec51a1) for our community and friends.\n\nWith the recently [enacted proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c98bd010-74b1-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556) by [Nacho](https://governance.decentraland.org/profile/?address=0x87956abC4078a0Cc3b89b419928b857B8AF826Ed) - Decentraland landowners can now keep their VP when engaging in a rental transaction. This has been requested by our landowners community as well and we would like to allow for landowners using LandWorks to keep their VP as well.\n\nOur development team has already created the snapshot strategy based on the enacted proposal. The code is available [here](https://github.com/EnterDAO/snapshot-strategies/tree/decentraland/landworks-rents/src/strategies/decentraland-landworks-rents).\n\nThis could potentially allocate back about 320,000 VP to a small community who have proactively requested to use their VP.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe imapct of this proposal is to include VP of LAND/Estate that have been listed in LandWorks. As the community has expressed interest in this,\nwe have implemented a strategy, similar to the one created for Decentraland's [Renting protocol](https://github.com/EnterDAO/snapshot-strategies/tree/master/src/strategies/decentraland-rental-lessors). You can find the implementation [here](https://github.com/EnterDAO/snapshot-strategies/tree/decentraland/landworks-rents/src/strategies/decentraland-landworks-rents).\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nIn order the proposal to become active, here are the steps that need to be implemented:\n\n*   We think that a member of the Decentraland development team would be great to verify that the snapshot strategy is implemented as expected.\n*   Then, we will create a Pull Request to the main Snapshot repository.\n*   Once the Pull Request has been merged, an admin from the Decentraland Snapshot Space has to enable the strategy.\n\nLet me know if there are any questions, comments or concerns (@fungibletaco).\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe LandWorks team and landowners community believe every landowner should be allowed to utilize their VP within the Decentraland community. This can be achieved due to the [enacted proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c98bd010-74b1-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556) and we have already prepared [the code (strategy)](https://github.com/EnterDAO/snapshot-strategies/tree/decentraland/landworks-rents/src/strategies/decentraland-landworks-rents) to do so. We believe going through the official proposal process will promote transparency and will allow the strategy to be considered valid and enabled by Decentraland.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Here's the official link below.\n\nhttps://github.com/search?q=repo%3Adecentraland%2Fbuilder%20WORLDS_CONTENT_SERVER\\&type=code\n\nAlthough the Worlds feature is an excellent idea in many ways, deploying Worlds requires additional technical knowledge. This is not very ideal for new users. Because of this reason foundation has decided to make this whole process user friendly where anyone can deploy a worlds via few click from the builder app. However this feature is only limited to foundation servers. I believe non foundation servers should also be supported. We can't have a true decentralised experience or platform if only the the centralised servers are supported.

Our tool is the first to automate the analysis of transaction data as an indicator of tax treatment in order to maintain total coverage of transactions on chains we support. Through our integration with Ethereum, we have achieved complete coverage of Ethereum protocols in our tax calculator in under 6 months of development time with a single developer, far exceeding the capabilities of any existing tax calculation platform.  As Decentraland users are more and more often trading in different DeFi tokens (even within the Decentraland platform), we are passionate about giving your community peace of mind in their portfolio accounting\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n10,000 USD in MANA\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xdBb63a19a309ADd33621805A596E2EBb022fc823\n\n## Email address\n\nelias@cartera.io\n\n## Description\n\nWe reduce barriers to adoption for retail and sophisticated users participating in DeFi by providing an intuitive user interface and accurate tax reporting. Demand for crypto tax software increased 33x from 2018 to 2022, indicating that tax filing may be one of the primary anxieties of new users and institutions jumping into DeFi. Integration with Cartera means no more manual tax calculation, no more egregious errors, and no more dedicated tax accounting departments for users in your ecosystem.\n\nOur initial release will feature everything you need to get a comprehensive view of your portfolio and associated tax obligations, including capital gains and losses calculations, transaction history reporting, and data aggregation from both wallets and exchanges.\n\nA key pillar of our platform is our commitment to user privacy and security. We understand that many DeFi users value their privacy and want to keep their financial information confidential. As such, we are designing our platform to comply with the highest industry standards for security and privacy.  We will not store identifying user data in any centrally accessible fashion after rolling out Cartera.\n\nWe are applying for $10,000 in grant funding, to be used in two ways:\n\n*   $2,000 USD to compensate a developer who will run a light audit to ensure Cartera is properly integrated with PROTOCOL; this will ensure that any potential issues are captured upfront by our team\n*   $8,000 USD will be paid out to new customers of Cartera who made transactions on Decentraland. We'll payout redemptions based on a simple off-chain confirmation method to ensure new customers must be users of Decentraland to receive the discount.\n\nOur goal for the project is timely rollout of Cartera in preparation for the 2023 tax season and confirmation that our platform works seamlessly with all transaction types on Decentraland.  A key part of our goal is also to facilitate onboarding of DeFi users onto Cartera in our covered regions (starting with the US).\n\nWe will measure success based on our ability to carry out the above, and so far have gotten great feedback from prospective users and comparative  analyses alike in assessing accuracy of our tool against incumbents.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n\\[DONE] Discord bot (May) - a discord bot that feeds back transaction summary data when sent a transaction ID; this transaction summary data is the basis of DeFi accounting and tax calculation\n\nMVP (June) - MVP for reporting transaction summary data for a wallet’s end of year tx history\n\nProtocol accuracy testing (July) - validating that MVP is 100% accurate on PROTOCOL\n\nAnalytics dashboard (September) - expanded portfolio analytics features incl. daily capital gains & losses\n\nFinal front-end (November) - usable Cartera app\n\nSetup apply for a refund / discount code flow (Dec) - redemptions from customers who provide evidence that they use Decentraland.  At this point we will make a public announcement to the community that Cartera is available and free for the first ~100 Decentraland users\n\nLaunch and marketing (Jan) - official launch of Cartera for tax season 2023\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Therefore this proposal is due to the collective request by the LandWorks landowner community.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n[LandWorks](https://landworks.xyz/) is a metaverse land rental marketplace. It’s a product of EnterDAO and was launched with support for Decentraland in January 2022. Since its inception, LandWorks has supported Decentraland LANDs and ESTATEs rentals and so far has accumulated over [300 rents](https://dune.com/rakis/LandWorks).\n\nThe protocol has been active in the Decentraland community. Last summer LandWorks hosted the [Open Scenes Grant Program](https://landworks.xyz/app/grants-program) where more than $50,000 were rewarded to builders in the Decentraland community for their scene creations. The scenes were also open sources for anyone to use them. We have also purchased a 2x2 ESTATE where we have our [signature scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKZ74OJnwvI) which has already hosted [two parties](https://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=f6480837-0a94-4ac9-bb14-77c294ec51a1) for our community and friends.\n\nWith the recently [enacted proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c98bd010-74b1-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556) by [Nacho](https://governance.decentraland.org/profile/?address=0x87956abC4078a0Cc3b89b419928b857B8AF826Ed) - Decentraland landowners can now keep their VP when engaging in a rental transaction. This has been requested by our landowners community as well and we would like to allow for landowners using LandWorks to keep their VP as well.\n\nOur development team has already created the snapshot strategy based on the enacted proposal. The code is available [here](https://github.com/EnterDAO/snapshot-strategies/tree/decentraland/landworks-rents/src/strategies/decentraland-landworks-rents).\n\nThis could potentially allocate back about 320,000 VP to a small community who have proactively requested to use their VP.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe LandWorks team and landowners community believe every landowner should be allowed to utilize their VP within the Decentraland community. This can be achieved due to the [enacted proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c98bd010-74b1-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556) and we have already prepared [the code (strategy)](https://github.com/EnterDAO/snapshot-strategies/tree/decentraland/landworks-rents/src/strategies/decentraland-landworks-rents) to do so. We believe going through the official proposal process will promote transparency and will allow the strategy to be considered valid and enabled by Decentraland.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x58754d9b3dbb4ddf5ac3502acb963743b15e6398 (METAGAMEHUB)\n\nShould the following $39,127 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the development of [DCL-Edit](https://dcl-edit.com/), a visual scene editor for Decentraland, by METAGAMEHUB DAO (MGH). The project scope has been adjusted after a previous rejection to align with the new Decentraland Editor from the foundation. MGH will focus on specific areas identified through collaboration with the official Decentraland development team, ensuring compatibility between the editors with shared data structures. This compatibility allows for seamless switching between the editors and promotes the growth of both platforms. The Decentraland development team recognizes the value of DCL-Edit and provides active support for its development.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n39,127 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n4 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2a9Da28bCbF97A8C008Fd211f5127b860613922D\n\n## Email address\n\ncamilo.echeverri@thedac.info\n\n## Description\n\nThis proposal focuses on aligning and enhancing specific areas where DCL-Edit diverges from the official Decentraland Editor. Together with the Decentraland team, we have identified these key areas of improvement:\n\n*   Live Model Update: make changes to models visible in real-time without the need to re-import them or reload the scene, which greatly simplifies and accelerates scene building, especially when working in parallel in a larger team\n*   Compatibility for different model formats, eliminating the time and effort required for exporting and importing\n*   A Code-Free UI Editor for empowering non-coders in creating visually appealing and interactive UI experiences (the Decentraland foundation is working on enabling developers to create UI using React code, which is great, but which still requires coding skills)\n\nDCL-Edit V3 will be able to load any created 3D scene from the official Decentraland Editor and vice-versa. We are working together on an intermediate data structure that is being used by both editors, making them inherently compatible. As it turned out, we already have a good basis for that in our editors.\n\nDCL-Edit V3 will fully support Decentraland SDK 7. An update for DCL-Edit V2 to support SDK7 is planned as well.\n\nDCL-Edit will continue to serve as a cornerstone in the Decentraland development environment, offering features comparable to established game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine. The current V2 has a nice set of features that make it a powerful tool for developers already (see a full feature list here).\n\nTo optimize costs, scope reduction and skipping the planned QA phase from the last proposal are proposed. Community approval and involvement will drive DCL-Edit's improvement and stability over time.\n\nA  detailed overview of the planned features can be found in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16cKe1p1H8BeO2EYO0Wq7SwovNYJXHN080xLF5r3IjkE/edit#heading=h.r03xvobexfk5)\n\nSee a cost breakdown and a timeline for the above in this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K7\\_Q6KTPOI9G2qiZ6yPmCN8uRAq4cZHXLa0Ap8O9u3I/edit#gid=0).\n\nAdditionally, contributions beyond DCL-Edit will continue to be executed, including \"Builder of the Month\", bi-weekly coding sessions, and tutorial sessions for creating games in Decentraland. The goal is to foster an attractive environment for expert developers.\n\nThe importance of having an editor capable of accommodating professionals and non-coders cannot be overstated. It is crucial for gaining traction and attracting a diverse user base to the Decentraland platform.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nBelow are the planned milestones including the planned intermediate releases for each month. More details about each step can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1W1SQGbxaWaJv3S6ITK3K4E35MOJU3JJyFt9Nb4RkA/edit#).\n\n**June 2023 - Version 2.1**\n\n*   SDK 7 compatibility\n*   VS Code extension (launch DCL-Edit within VS Studio)\n\n**July 2023 - Version 3 Alpha I**\n\n*   Render like Decentraland client\n*   new GUI design\n\n**August 2023 - Version 3 Alpha II**\n\n*   Live Model Update and improved modelling workflows\n    scene optimizations\n\n**September 2023 - Version 3**\n\n*   UI Editor\n    *   Text, Buttons, Progress Bars, Images\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Infrastructure for LANDs",
    "body": "> by 0x8218a2445679e38f358e42f88fe2125c98440d59 (1010)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Infrastructure for LANDs](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=dd5bf7c0-efe3-11ed-813c-b353c3943eab)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis governance proposal is to advance the setting up of infrastructure for LANDs use by the community.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\n4 polls were conducted and 3 conclusions were derived.\n\n1.  Create a specific category for LAND related matters on the DAO proposal page named \"LAND\".\n\nRefer to Annex (A)\n\n2.  All proposals will be decided on a case by case basis, including the permitted tenure as well as whether cost is involved.\n\nRefer to Annex (B) and (C)\n\n3.  The 'Acceptance Threshold' should be set at 2m Voting Power for 1 parcel, and thereafter, a dynamic threshold is triggered.\n\nRefer to Annex (D)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the successful passing and subsequent enacting of the LAND purchase agreement by the DAO, infrastructure should be set up to allow all members to start using LAND.\n\nThrough various consultations held in the past months, the DAO has come to an agreement to set up a process in which potential tenants can submit applications for approval by the community.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThere are 5 key goals to be achieved with this proposal.\n\n1.  Create a specific category for LAND related matters on the DAO proposal page named \"LANDs\".\n\n2.  Implement an application form format for potential tenants.\n    The form will include categories such as location, title, purpose, amount of time to be occupied, rent payable PER DAY during occupancy (if any) and other information.\n\n3.  Set the 'Acceptance Threshold' at 2m VP for the 1st parcel and 200k VP for each of the remaining parcels thereafter. The allotted time for each vote will be 7 days.\n    It'll work out as follows:\n\n1plot: 2m VP\n\n2 plots and above: 2m VP + \\[(total plots-1) x 200k VP].\nFor example, 6 plots will be 3m VP.\n\n4.  A maximum tenure of 90 days for members and 180 days for Squads will be implemented.\n\n5.  Proposals for the use or revocation of LAND need only go through 1 round of application, similar to POIs.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nCost to buy LAND is always a consideration for developers when deploying their work inside Decentraland. Should this proposal be passed and enacted, the DAO will be able to provide the community and potential entrants with more cost effective options, thereby alleviating concerns about cost, especially in the early/developmental stages.\n\nAs renting/providing LAND to community members is a novel idea to the DAO, there will be risks involved, such as the possibility of hoarding, misuse or the lack thereof. Therefore, revision of conditions will be needed down the line depending on what issues the DAO experiences during the intial process. A review in 6 months is recommended.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n1.  Create a specific category for LAND related matters on the DAO proposal page named \"LANDs\".\n    All matters OTHER THAN the transfer, sale/purchase, modifying the name and contract of LAND/ESTATEs should fall under this category. This includes but is not limited to rentals, revocations, renewal of tenure etc.\n\n2.  Implement an application form format for potential tenants. A sample of the form will be provided in the comments.\n\n3.  Set the 'Acceptance Threshold' at 2m VP for the 1st parcel and 200k VP for each of the remaining parcels thereafter. The formula will be 2m VP + \\[(total plots-1) x 200k VP].\n    The allotted time for each vote will be 7 days.\n\n4.  The tenure for LANDs will be denominated in 7, 30, 60 and 90 days. A 180 days option will be available for Squads. This will be reflected in the application. All tenure will begin from the time they are successfully delegated as ‘operator’.\n\n5.  Proposals for the use or revocation of LAND need only go through 1 round of application, similar to POIs.\n\n6.  Upon approval, if no monetary transaction is involved, the tenant will be given 'operator' permission for the stipulated time. If a monetary transaction is involved, the tenant will have to make the full transfer of the rent before being set as operator.\n\n7.  Gas fees cannot exceed 70 GWEI per transaction. This is to ensure that DAO funds are not depleted quickly should there be a surge in gas fees.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith the governance proposal for LAND purchase enacting soon, setting up the infrastructure for use of LAND is the next step.

    "title": "Should the DAO Increase Polygon GWEI Threshold?",
    "body": "> by 0x56469159d91eb810dce34dd13ec4ed8194bca7be (NikkiFuego)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Should the DAO Increase Polygon GWEI Threshold?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=6813db10-f013-11ed-9bc2-e5fe350d0c93)\n\n## Summary\n\nFor the past several months, Polygon GWEI has been out of control. Currently, the threshold for \"free\" gas to the consumer is 150 GWEI. Meaning that anytime GWEI is higher than 150, Decentraland provided services fail.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nHaving a marketplace and platform that provides free gas to its users is a huge selling point when onboarding new users and builders. When an entire quarter goes by where GWEI is consistently above 150, that selling point becomes obsolete.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nSome examples of Decentraland services that fail when GWEI is above 150 are:\n\n*   Purchasing - Both primary and secondary purchases.\n*   Transferring - Sending wearables to other wallets.\n*   Minting\n*   Publishing - As well as adding minters/collaborators and putting items *on sale*.\n*   L2 Services - Air-dropping wearables or transferring MANA with Decentralands script. This directly impacts Play-to-Earn games.\n\nIn some cases, with purchases in-game on LAND or in Play-to-Earn games, the user does not have the option to swap to Polygon Network because that results in them disconnecting from the in-game experience as that requires a constant connection to Ethereum Network.\n\nIt's a huge red flag for new users. I know when I started out I had very little knowledge of what GWEI was and how it worked exactly. A lot of new users likely do not own MATIC or know to purchase it. Therefore the **sales conversion funnel that the foundation spends enormous amounts of effort on fails**.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nCurrently, the DAO covers these gas costs and the average is $1k-$2k USD worth of Matic spent each month on Polygon GWEI (data provided by HP).\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nEnacting this proposal will allow greater scalability and flexibility with free meta-transactions across the entire platform. Gas is already paid for by curation fees that the DAO receives on the Polygon network. There is more than enough in reserve and from each fee, that doubling this threshold will **not** create a negative financial impact on the DAO. This will allow more free meta-transactions during peak GWEI times to ensure the platform continues to grow in transactions that return royalties and other revenue.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nUpon community approval, the DAO committee will update the Polygon GWEI threshold from 150 to 300. Once the number has been changed it will be reflected on the network instantly.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis draft is to increase the threshold from 150 to 300 to meet the new standard norm that we've been experiencing for the last few months. While GWEI can still go higher than this amount, this should help increase the number of free transactions drastically.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Recognition of Decentraland DAO's Support by Grant Recipients",
    "body": "> by 0x7bbea9c18cd0541acab8c19da2b11d0c03faef1c (1Existence)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Proposal for Recognition of Decentraland in Future Grant Recipient Projects (POLL)](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d1e5ff30-da30-11ed-bfff-7567e61aeee0)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis Draft Proposal outlines the purpose and the process for adding specific requirements to future grantees, in order to foster Decentraland’s brand and Decentraland DAO's awareness.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to add specific requirements to future Decentraland DAO grant agreements, for recipients to acknowledge the support of the Decentraland DAO. This would help raise awareness of Decentraland's support for innovation and community initiatives, and enhance the platform's reputation. Since there is a separation of Decentraland Foundation and Decentraland DAO, all mention of Decentraland is in regards to the DAO.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nTo enhance recognition and community confidence in Decentraland DAO, we propose that all future grant recipients prominently acknowledge the support they receive. This acknowledgment should be displayed on their websites, marketing materials, or other relevant platforms. Currently, only the Sponsorship category requires brand awareness.\n\nWe also recommend establishing an official social media account for community updates and marketing purposes. This will not only raise awareness of Decentraland's role in supporting innovation but also enhance the platform's visibility and reputation.\n\nWe suggest that these requirements be included in all future Decentraland grant agreements. While the choice of social media platforms—Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.—is at the grantee's discretion, having an active official social media account is recommended. However, it's mandatory for grantees receiving a Social Media grant.\n\nNote: The recommendation for all grantees to have a social media account was suggested during the polling period. After input from the GSS, it was decided to make this a recommendation, not a requirement, except for those receiving Social Media grants.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nBy 'prominent acknowledgment', we mean clear, visible recognition of the support received from Decentraland DAO. This could take the form of at least 1 or more of the following:\n\n1.  Website Acknowledgment:\n\n    *   Grant recipients must include a clearly visible acknowledgment of Decentraland DAO’s support on their project's main website. This acknowledgment should consist of the Decentraland logo, a brief statement of support, and a link to the Decentraland website. To comply with Decentraland’s Terms of Use Policy all written materials relating to your product, including websites, publications, etc. it must be made clear that you do not have any kind of affiliation, business partnerships or other official association with Decentraland, the DAO or the Decentraland Foundation.\n\n    For example:\n\n\"This project is generously supported by the Decentraland DAO. Visit \\[https://decentraland.org/] to learn more about their commitment to fostering innovation and creativity within the virtual world.\"\n\n      Note: This is only to acknowledge the support given from the Decentraland DAO.  \n\nRefer to the Terms of Use policy: https://decentraland.org/brand\n\n     * Another option would be to create a dedicated page on your project's website to acknowledge the support of the Decentraland DAO. This page can include:\n\n     * Decentraland Logo: Display the Decentraland logo prominently at the top of the page. Per the terms of use, the only allowable logo can be found here: https://www.figma.com/file/pBiYuNALsSEFncGy3x6dIZ/DecentralandLogo?node-id=3162%3A117\n\n     * Acknowledgment Statement: Include a statement expressing gratitude for the support received from the Decentraland DAO, e.g., \"We are grateful for the generous support provided by the Decentraland DAO, which has been instrumental in the success of our project.\"\n\n     * About Decentraland: Add a brief description of Decentraland and its mission, highlighting its commitment to fostering innovation, creativity, and community engagement within the virtual world.\n\n     *  Link to Decentraland's Website: Provide a hyperlink to Decentraland's official website, encouraging visitors to learn more about the platform and its initiatives.\n\n     * Visuals or Media: If applicable, showcase images or videos of your project that demonstrate the impact of Decentraland DAO's support, such as event photos, workshop materials, or other relevant content.\n\nEither option would be considered sufficient acknowledgement.\n\nThe options under Marketing and Social Media will  have to be viewed on the google doc as there is not enough space to the complete the full proposal here.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1jjbIUpzTDOSCEPeXUNGxYk8lGZR3uLJ7vU82YoLuaRU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThese will  also be put in the first comment box so it will not be necessary to click a  link for those that do not wish to.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy implementing these requirements for future grant recipients, we can ensure that Decentraland receives appropriate recognition for its contributions to the growth and development of the virtual world. This will not only benefit Decentraland's visibility but also help foster a sense of community and collaboration among the various projects supported by the platform. The use of social media as a tool to support the Decentraland DAO and build community confidence will further strengthen the relationship between grant recipients and the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Unlocking the Power of Portable Experiences",
    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce and experiment with a powerful feature called \"Portable Experiences\" (PE) within the virtual world. PE offers a global scene overlay visible only to players who have it enabled, similar to Augmented Reality in the virtual world.\n\nThis feature unlocks new mechanics, such as guiding players through quests, having pets follow them, providing contextual information through a UI layer, and enabling other delightful experiences created by our community of creators. Portable Experiences can be deployed to a world content server and activated in-world through the SDK, for example, by interacting with non-player characters (NPCs).\n\nPortable Experiences can be compared to another well-known feature called \"Smart Wearables\" (SW), which are essentially portable experiences tied to specific Wearables. When players equip these Smart Wearables, they gain access to unique abilities or visuals that are not available to other players without them.\n\nBoth Portable Experiences and Smart Wearables have been developed and tested by the Decentraland Foundation. For example, during the recent MVFW event, all players interacted with a PE that was activated by default. This PE showcased a new UI button, offered enhanced information, and even provided teleportation to interesting places. Additionally, during the past Christmas event, Smart Wearables in the form of a jetpack allowed Santa and Grinch to fly and drop presents.\n\n![Fashion Week Portable Experience](https://yemel.github.io/dao-images/px-fashion-week.png)\\\n*Portable Experience*\n\n![Chrismas Smart Wearable](https://yemel.github.io/dao-images/sw-jetpack.png)\\\n*Smart Wearable*\n\n### The proposal\n\nThe proposal is to prioritize the implementation and availability of Portable Experiences (PE) for creators in the community. This feature can be easily implemented using the SDK and can be accessed by guest accounts as well. The only missing element is the documentation that outlines the implementation details, which can be accomplished with minimal effort. By providing this documentation, the Foundation can significantly benefit the Decentraland Ecosystem.\n\nIn contrast, the process of making the Smart Wearables feature accessible to all creators requires establishing a submission, curation, and publishing system in the Marketplace.  This more complex undertaking involves significant coordination and development efforts from the Foundation, which are planned for implementation later this year.\n\n### Considerations\n\nTo ensure a secure and fair experience for users, several considerations need to be taken into account when implementing Portable Experiences. These considerations include:\n\n1.  Consent and User Control: Portable Experience should only be loaded with the user's consent. They should also have the option to disable or turn off a PE if they no longer wish to participate in it.\n\n2.  Safeguards for LAND Owners: LAND owners should have the ability to disable portable experiences within their scenes. This ensures that the gameplay and integrity of their created environments are not compromised.\n\n3.  Performance Optimization: To ensure a smooth and optimal user experience, it is recommended that portable experiences are developed using the latest SDK version, such as SDK7. This newer version offer improved performance and better support for UI elements. Additionally, it may be necessary to impose certain limitations, such as restricting the number of entities created by the portable experience, to maintain overall performance in the explorer.\n\n4.  Iterative Improvement: Portable Experiences represent a powerful feature that unlocks a multitude of possibilities. To maximize their potential, it is advisable to release an initial version and gather feedback from creators who utilize the feature.\n\nFurthermore, this proposal serves as a stepping stone toward the launch of Smart Wearables. Enabling the monetization of such experiences through Smart Wearables can enhance accessibility and offer new opportunities for creators to showcase their work while enriching the overall Decentraland experience.\n\n### Next steps\n\nIf the response to this proposal is positive, the Foundation will publish the documentation for Portable Experiences, enabling creators to start making and publishing their own PE. After two months of the release, the Foundation will evaluate the impact of this experiment based on the number of PEs created, overall performance impact, and the number of issues reported in the Support channels. If Portable Experiences are widely used and there are no significant issues, the feature will continue to be available in the long run. The Foundation will also continue to iterate and add more capabilities to enhance the PE experience.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Big Yellow Fishes - Promotional Content",
    "body": "> by 0x19f10e449a2479b4ff0fdf9db65ad021674f3699\n\nShould the following $5,000 grant in the Social Media Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nBig Yellow Fishes (BYF) is a Metaverse media and marketing company. Initially focusing on Somnium Space, the BYF team have recently branched out into other platforms such as Hyperfy, Mona, Voxels and now wish to expand offerings into the Decentraland community. BYF will produce a series of short-form media content including live performances from within Decentraland and promotional, journlaistic pieces, that highlight creators and parcel owners from within Decentraland. BYF also plan on releasing a community-first, vox-pop style series. BYF currently consists of Tom, a marketing specialist in the gaming industry, and Matt, a senior media/games design lecturer. BYF aim to push Decentraland to the masses by producing community first content.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x19F10E449A2479B4Ff0FDF9dB65AD021674f3699\n\n## Email address\n\nbigyellowfisheslive@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nBig Yellow Fishes (BYF) should recieve funding as their track record of producing content for Metaverse platforms is impressive, with videos reaching millions of influential, social media audiences within the space. BYF produce modern, fast and engaging content aimed at introducing newer audiences to platforms and thus transfering them into the worlds themselves.\n\nDecentraland, along with other Metaverses, can be difficult to sell to a newer audience, with negativity and slander being reported in the news. BYF provide audiences with short-form content on popular channels such as Twitter, YouTube and TikTok engaging with people straight away, slowly changing the narrative that is surrounding Metaverses, which naturally converts to people logging in themselves.\n\nAlong with traditional benefits that a company like BYF provide, their recent collaboration with Yauga, a metaverse wellness company, can easily be converted to bring them into decentraland too, along with their partners, the BAT community (Brave).\n\nBYF are used to dealing with challenges that working in the NFT/WEB 3 space bring, however, the benefits strongly outway the negatives and provide a fantastic opportunity for companies like BYF to promote Metaverses such as Decentraland.\n\nPreviously BYF have recieved a small, financial grant from Somnium Space until completion. Not only does this prove that BYF are able to fufill grant terms, it also shows that BYF are ready to take their next steps in working with a larger, more established Metaverse.\n\nAlthough BYF are only asking for a small amount of captial, they believe this a perfect oppourtunity to prove to Decentraland and it's community what they can do. BYF aim to apply for further funding in the future, once a relationship has been established.\n\nOverall, BYF believe they can really add something special to the Decentraland eco-system, and promote the Metaverse in a new, more exciting light, on social media channels and beyond. Everyone at BYF is excited to begin working and exploring Decentraland and producing the very best content!\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMONTH 1 -\n\n1.  Release of 'Metaperature Sessions' - A Metaverse series promoting musicians and other creatives in the space. These will be organised, produced and filmed within Decentraland itself. Our KPI for this will be to release one video per-week involving either a performance or a interview.\n\n2.  Short-form content surrounding Decentraland, this may include community events, parcel highlights and vox-pops. These will be released on a regular, ad-hoc basis, and will be shared to the Decentraland Discord.\n\nMONTH 2 -\n\n1.  Continue everything in Month 1.\n\n2.  Produce a Decentraland promotional video, featuring members of the community and spaces within the Metaverse. Our KPI for this will be to release this by the end of month 2. We are estimating that this will be between 30-60 seconds.\n\nMONTH 3 -\n\n1.  Continue everything in Month 1.\n\n2.  Close project and wrap up any final videos. Begin discussions regarding further funding opportunities.\n\nENTIRE PROJECT\n\n1.

    "title": "Mark District X as 'stolen'",
    "body": "> by 0x8b257b97c0e07e527b073b6513ba8ea659279b61 (Morph)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[District X: Contentious Leadership](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c0e5dd50-d895-11ed-bfff-7567e61aeee0)\n\n## Summary\n\nDue to contentious leadership, failure to hold up core commitments to original contributors, and improper conduct of RobL#4045 - this proposes to mark District X itself as 'stolen' on the Decentraland marketplace.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nRecently, the community has engaged in an investigation over the handling of District X, and the current leadership of RobL#4045.\n\nThis investigation has brought to light several issues:\n\n*   Rob became custodian of District X without contributor’s input; when the original custodians left, Rob took leadership custody, alongside Carl F via a centralized decision of original leadership who could not continue.\n\n*   The land is sitting in a wallet with multi-sig, controlled by an LLC that is owned entirely by Rob and a ‘partner’, no contributors were given a share despite original contributor agreement mentioning group purchase & ownership of land.\n\n*   Rob has removed all rights from contributors, stating that he owes them nothing, and that the land is his to control.\n\n*   Rob’s contribution to district X is believed to be 2 parcels out of 2,001 total (.099%)\n\n*   Rob has failed to deliver financial records of the Districts performance year over year as outlined in contributor agreements, despite public information that he is renting out the land for payment.\n\n*   Attempts to resolve this in the District X discord has led to Rob banning or muting original contributors from District X forums such as Discord and Twitter.\n\n*   Rob has conversed with multiple different interested parties to sell the entire district for personal gain (by transferring ownership of the LLC), for a large sum (~7 figures). Rob did not consult contributors and has stated they have no rights. When confronted - he states the assets are his and his partners to do as they please, including selling it in its entirety and keeping the money.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe believe this is wrong for a few reasons:\n\n1.) - The custodians of districts were always intended to be just that, custodians. Their job was to uphold a system in which contributors could consult or be consulted - when a custodian could no longer act in the best interests of the district, leadership should return to the foundation/DAO/contributors to continue the vision. We have seen this occur before with Rob being brought on via centralized decision by previous leadership once they could not continue.\n\n2.) - The district has completely pivoted from its original intent, while this may be acceptable in some circumstances, the decision was made by Rob without consultation of contributors. Rob has not upheld any critical pieces of the original contributor agreement nor the district foundation agreement - after four years and lack of progress, this is a massive failure, and solidifies that Rob not only has no intent to sufficiently develop the district, but also refuses to use existing methods of tracking contributor involvement on the direction - this is further complicated by Rob banning contributors who disagree, or outright deleting history/channels/servers/accounts (like the District X twitter or discord).\n\n3.) - Contributors have made multiple attempts since 2019 to raise these issues, they were either silenced by bans, or outright told they had no rights to District involvement.\nWhen raising this issue, either by contributors, or DCL’s community in general, Rob’s response has been ‘sue me’ and that he is the true ‘owner’ of these contributed lands, despite being rumored to only have contributed 2 parcels himself and little to no relevant district development occurring.\n\n4.) Many of the builds that won the Decentraland public building competition were placed on District X without consent of creators. This, alongside Rob renting land to the highest bidders (most of which seem unaware of the shady nature of the land they are renting) for personal income, is a great example of how Rob is leveraging others work in an attempt to make the district look active while not providing any useful development towards the District plan itself.\n\n5.) Rob is weaponizing the 4M District VP against the community, recently declaring it 'his' VP in an interview and continuously voting against DistrictX contributors wishes. Rob has already used DistrictX VP to deny grants to those critical of him, or to vote in favor of those that defend his claims - as this VP was not purchased by Rob, he has an unequally assigned vote which does not carry the standard investment risk,  disrupting the democratic process of the DAO.\n\nSo that’s where we are now, a user who had a small contribution to district X, was deputized without the contributor’s agreement, and now has outright taken the land hostage via an LLC, refusing to release it even after 5 years of failed district leadership and instead weaponizing the power he has been assigned against original contributors and the platform itself.\n\nWe, the DAO, must find a delicate balance of defending against platform level attacks, while also carefully considering the impact any changes may have. For this reason, I believe we must only take temporary and interface level action - designed to notify and raise awareness, so that all decentralized parties may make their own informed decision.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal would add a simple 'stolen' flag on the the District X marketplace page:\n\n![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1084887605017059329/1108430085851189299/DistrictX\\_4.png)\n\nThis would be a front-end change only (including front-end APIs), bids will not be able to be placed nor sales made on the marketplace frontend. However, any user can still interact with the Decentraland contracts themselves to perform these same actions, this is not a blockchain protocol level change, simply an interface modification.\n\nThe flag can be removed with District X meeting one of the following conditions:\n\n*   DistrictX is placed inside a new 'locked' District contract that has no removal function, enabling delegation to a community voted leader (by District X DAO vote, fairly tokenized with original contributors share), forever removing the ability to split/sell/transfer the land.\n\n*   DistrictX is placed under fairly decided new decentralized leadership and DistrictX LLC is disintegrated, with DCLDAO as part of the new multi-sig as a backstop should the same issues occur.\n\n*   DistrictX is disintegrated and all land is returned to original contributors (although this option likely leads to many lands owned by inactive wallets, it would ensure original contributors are made whole). Any inactive wallets/land could temporarily be used as a community space by foundation/DAO until claimed.\n\nMost importantly, there will be NO contract level changes from this vote, we will not forcefully remove assets, we will not alter NFT immutability, we will simply be making a front end interface change to raise awareness about the situation as decided by the votes outcome. Should Rob/DistrictX want to move forward with removing the stolen tag, they can do so, as they will not be prevented from modifications or continuing development, all requirements to remove the stolen tag will be within District X's control.\n\nWe MUST protect the DCL community from buying or renting District X while unaware of it's history, only to find it comes with community baggage, agreements, and contributors that were supposed to be involved in decision making. We must prevent contributors from being silenced/banned and removed while their contribution is on-sold without their consent by a leader who has abandoned the outlined agreements and original contracts of contribution for personal profit.\n\nYou can find further evidence and past discussions as well as participate on this topic in the Decentraland DAO's #district discord channel: https://discord.com/channels/894658869391933540/1074369083228815390\n\nYou can also read some shorter summaries here:\nhttps://realdistrictx.medium.com/district-x-on-decentraland-a8e10279e874\nhttps://www.playdcl.games/post/decentraland-s-district-x-the-x-is-for-fraud\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGiven the points above, this is not a simple case of an unhappy consumer - this is a clear case of early good-faith users & creators being stripped of their agreed upon right to participate in the DAO (District) they contributed to, by a shoddily-appointed malicious leader seeking to extract wealth and serve only themself.\n\nWe, as the governing body of DCL, have a responsibility to resolve internal issues when attacks are carried out by the platform we have created - as a global platform, we cannot enable criminals to hide behind geo-restricted LLCs as a means to validate their coercion  - we must use the DCL DAO as it is designed to resolve this problem that we ourselves have created; Especially one as complicated, nuanced and impactful to the community as District X.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The current process of  hiring developers to code is costly and time-consuming. By developing the MRT, we offer a simple, no-code solution for Decentraland citizens.\n\nThrough these problem-solving features, the MRT project aims to revolutionise the way Decentraland citizens access, create,\nand interact with virtual spaces, offering a cost-effective and user-friendly alternative to the current process.\n\n[Full version of Grant Proposal (With Links)](https://mrt.games/proposal/MRT_GRANT_PROPOSAL.html)\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n110,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xb12ba0b2dc9d9811a7e3b1f76b3f8318bcb58f20\n\n## Email address\n\ndigalgfund@pm.me\n\n## Description\n\nThe Meta Residence Tower represents a virtual skyscraper with 10,000 NFT apartments (spaces).\nAccess to an apartment is provided with an NFT key, which the user can purchase on the website or in the building itself.\n\nThe building offers four types of layouts: Studio, 1BHK, 2BHK, and Penthouse. There is also the possibility to make it an open space.\n\nEach apartment includes an interior design constructor with more than 700 furniture items  (from bedroom to bathroom),\nalong with options for ceilings, floors, and wallpapers. Users can create unique furniture arrangements with this tool.\n\nThere are also interactive Smart Items and Upgrades that expand user interaction:\n\n*   Boombox: A music player.\n*   Picture frames and large banners.\n*   Dance floors.\n*   Discord, Telegram, Twitter, Website links\n*   Chroma key, multipurpose screen\n*   Animated light music, disco balls.\n*   NFT frames\n*   Donation box\n*   Few types of Video Screens: The owner can stream audio and video content directly to the apartment.\n*   There is also a paid CDN feature for broadcasting from our video servers.\n*   Programmable pin-code secured safe & door & noticeboard with text or images.\n*   Door Banner & Name\n*   UI - Clickable Banner\n*   We are actively adding more interactive experiences on a weekly basis.\n\n### Access features in the apartment\n\nBy default, only the user with the NFT key can enter the apartment. However, the owner can set various access levels:\n\n*   Public mode\n*   Pin code access\n*   Access by Wearables\n*   Access by NFTs\n*   Access for interior designers\n*   Access for payment.\n*   Membership: The owner can sell permanent access to their space.\n*   CCTV: The owner can see who has been in the apartment, how many times, and when their last visit was.\n\n### Gasless transactions\n\nWe have our own meta-transaction server. Payments can be made in two currencies: USDT and MANA at the current rate.\n\nMany use cases for their space are already available: mini-games, quests, NFT galleries, fashion shows, parties with\nstreaming in the apartment, parkour, paid events, business cards, shops, meeting places with friends, and a piece of\nhome and personal corner in the metaverse.\n\nAll these features above  have already been implemented\n\nThe project covers almost everything what general Decentraland citizen might need.\n\n### Our plans for sustainability\n\n*   Apartment sales\n*   Smart item sales\n*   Upgrade sales\n*   Sales Meta Residence Worlds (see below)\n\nAfter 8 months of development we have launched the beta version in late March\nand have already sold apartments, upgrades, and smart items amounting to over $12,000 this month\nWe ask the DAO to allocate $110,000 for current and future development.\nSince this is a commercial project, we want to repay the grant and contribute part of the revenue to the DAO.\n\nThe payment plan is as follows:\n\n*   30% of the sales of apartments, smart items, and upgrades will be transferred monthly to the DAO until the total\n    amount is repaid.\n*   After that we will also transfer 5% of the primary apartment sales to the DAO until all apartments are sold.\n\nAs a contribution to the community, we want to make the 8MetaBalls and 8MetaPawns, project fully open-source with scene and server code. We believe this will be a good contribution to examples of complex scenes and will certainly be one of the largest contributions to open-source scenes. But at the same time we will maintain the in-world version. These projects cover significant numbers of features might be helpful for the community.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### MRT:\n\n*   Delivering new smart items & Upgrades  for: Parties, NFT-Galleries, Wearables - Galleries, Games\n*   Developing the ability to sell NFT and Wearables from the apartments.\n*   Optimise models of furniture by weight and triangles.\n*   Creating tutorials about possibilities to easy onboard new users.\n*   Marketing efforts:\n    *   We're in the process of developing a solution to house non-Decentraland NFT collections within the Meta Residence Tower (MRT).\n    *   We're engaged in discussions with a number of real estate developers and furniture manufacturers who are looking to establish their brands in the metaverse via collaboration with MRT.\n    *   We are continuously onboarding new users through our collaborative initiatives within Decentraland.\n\n### Meta Residence Worlds\n\n*   As part of the community, we believe that Worlds will bring more attention to Decentraland itself. As Yemel has mentioned in Worlds 2.0 proposal, there are potentially 600k users who can have a piece of Decentraland.\n*   Since we have all the backend features and front-end code, delivering the same functionality to the Worlds would be a logical continuation for our project.\n*   The initial plan is to bring a few types of spaces: a Villa, Conference Space, Shop, Gallery, and\n    Open Space.\n*   Based on Worlds 2.0 proposal, we will deliver a solution to ENS holders (under 25 mb, a trimmed version), a full one for Name Holders(under 100mb), and a premium solution for those who can\n    increase the limits.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

We added two new layers: \"Points of Interest\" and \"Estates\", which we also polished to provide a better user experience.\n\nPoints of Interest layer:\n![Points of Interest](https://i.ibb.co/qY8p2wz/Points-of-Interest-2.jpg)\nEstates layer:\n![Estates](https://i.ibb.co/C89PgKS/Estates-2.jpg)\nFurthermore, we’ve implemented a permalinks system that allows users to link to specific coordinates on the map and updates the URL when moving the map. We have also added a parcel information modal that appears when you click on a specific parcel on the map. This sign displays the parcel URL link, which users can copy and share.\n\n![Permalink](https://i.ibb.co/jzhY8PX/Permalinks-system-2.jpg)\nWe’ve allowed the community to report broken coordinates, which has enabled us to make more accurate weekly updates to the map with the help of our users.\n\n![Report](https://i.ibb.co/y8jCQHF/Report-broken-coordinate-2.jpg)\nFinally, we improved our project's maintenance processes and stability. We paid off some technical debt, fixed bugs, and improved our database backup system.\n\nOn the team front, our previous developer (Rodrigo Heredia) left the project, and we welcomed Ivan as our new developer.\n\nWe remain committed to engaging with our community and continue to receive valuable feedback from our users, including requests for new features and improvements.\n\nThis grant will set up a budget, including salaries and expenses (web hosting, image storage, and domain name renewal), to run this team for the next 6 months of developments and updates. We will request further grants in the future if the community continues to be happy with our work.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nAs the Genesis City project approaches its second year, our team has been reflecting on our mission and vision.\nWe have defined the following objectives:\n\n*   Help the community discover Decentraland content\n*   Make people want to upload more content to Decentraland\n\nWe will update the map weekly for 6 months. Once that time has elapsed we will request another grant.\n\n**Here are some of the projects in our roadmap:**\n\n*   Create a user survey for gathering project feedback\n*   Implement a search feature for locating particular areas\n*   Share weekly parcel/scene recommendations from our team\n*   Dark mode Layer\n*   Establish a communication channel with the Foundation and showcase their featured content\n*   Create and share weekly tweets to increase project visibility\n*   Add status to the permalink system\n*   Add ability to log in with Metamask and display user-owned lands\n*   Move bug reporting to Netlify forms\n*   Add land/estate metadata on mouse over\n*   Go-to-marketplace for parcels on sale and rent Layer\n*   API for getting images from the map centered at specific coordinates\n*   Integrate livestream of virtual cameras from certain points in DCL\n*   Create a scoring system for the lands (review system)\n*   Offer isometric views (e.g., for Points of Interest)\n\n(more in comments)\n\n**We will continue improving the website and mapping script based on this list and future suggestions by our community.

This would be a testing period and perhaps extend the contest if proven successful.\n\nThe potential benefits include stimulating creativity within the Decentraland community, enhancing participation in the DAO, and promoting various themes that are relevant or topical. These themes could reflect real-world events, seasons, holidays, or other notable celebrations and could range from Earth (promoting nature, sustainability, recycling, etc.), Education (back to school, college, graduation, etc.), Art (music, written, painting, artists, etc.), Fall/Harvest, and The Metaverse. The themes are optional as it could be ran and any type of wearable could be submitted. Emotes to be included as well.\n\nThere are two reward options for consideration:\n\n1.  The winner of each month's contest receives their submission fee waived or receives a prize that would include the cost of submission.\n\n2.  The DAO purchases the winning wearable for a prize amount ($300-$500), and then either sells the wearable or awards them to community members that participate in governance and discussion.

    "body": "> by 0xa73f38ab3ec1649363c0b7dff45dc72e403c9a38\n\nShould the following $120,000 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nTrader's DAO is solving the $10B annual liquidation problem in the crypto futures market by building a decentralized trading bot marketplace that connects struggling traders with professional trading strategies. By offering a transparent, secure, and community-driven platform, Trader's DAO empowers users to make better-informed decisions and adopt more responsible trading practices. The goal is to create a Virtual Trading Hub, where you could create a virtual trading hub within Decentraland. Users can explore and interact with different trading strategies, participate in virtual trading workshops or discussions, and even watch live trading sessions. This would create a dynamic and engaging way to learn about and engage with crypto trading.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n12 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xA73F38ab3Ec1649363C0B7DFf45dC72e403c9A38\n\n## Email address\n\ndiazagasatya@kepingai.com\n\n## Description\n\nTrader's DAO is poised to transform the Decentraland platform by mitigating the high-liquidity risks inherent to crypto futures trading. Our project deserves funding because it will create a safer and more educated trading community within Decentraland, reducing the $10B annual liquidation problem in the crypto futures market. This will be achieved by integrating a decentralized trading bot marketplace, providing access to professional trading strategies, and fostering responsible trading behaviors. Furthermore, Trader's DAO aligns with the ethos of Decentraland by promoting decentralized governance and community-driven decision-making. The funding will enable us to develop and deploy this innovative feature, bringing tangible benefits to the platform and its users by enhancing financial stability and literacy.\n\nHere's how Trader's DAO helps address the issue:\n\n*   Access to Professional Trading Strategies: Trader's DAO provides a platform where traders can access a diverse range of trading strategies developed by experienced professionals. This allows users to learn from the expertise of successful traders, improve their risk management, and reduce the likelihood of liquidations.\n\n*   Decentralized Governance: Trader's DAO is governed by its community through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This ensures that the platform's development and decision-making processes are transparent, accountable, and driven by the needs of its users.\n\nThis can be accomplished through the development of a virtual space (LAND) in Decentraland where Trader's DAO can set up a presence, providing a unique, engaging, and immersive way for users to interact with the DAO and its services.\n\nHere are the extensions and benefits that this could bring to Decentraland:\n\n1.  Virtual Trading Hub: Trader's DAO could create a virtual trading hub within Decentraland, where users could explore and interact with different trading strategies, participate in virtual trading workshops or discussions, and even watch live trading sessions. This would create a dynamic and engaging way for users to learn about and engage with crypto trading.\n\n2.  Educational Resources: Trader's DAO could provide educational resources within its Decentraland property. This could include interactive lessons, workshops, or Q\\&A sessions with experienced traders. This would not only enhance the services of Trader's DAO but also enrich the educational content within Decentraland.\n\n3.  Community Engagement: Decentraland's virtual reality environment is ideal for community engagement. Trader's DAO could host regular community events, meetings, or voting sessions within their Decentraland property. This would allow for a more engaging and immersive DAO governance experience.\n\n4.  Advertising and Visibility: Having a presence in Decentraland could also increase the visibility of Trader's DAO. This could attract more users to the DAO, potentially increasing the number of successful traders and reducing the overall number of liquidations.\n\n5.  Economic Activity: By offering its services in Decentraland, Trader's DAO would contribute to the economic activity within the virtual world. This could involve transactions using MANA, Decentraland's native currency, thus integrating Trader's DAO more closely with the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n1.  Smart Contract Development (4-6 months): We'll develop the TAO smart contract, incorporating features for decentralized governance and trading strategy marketplace. We'll share weekly updates on development progress and any key decisions made regarding contract functionality.\n\n2.  Smart Contract Audit and Testing (1-2 months): The smart contract will undergo thorough testing and a security audit.\n\n3.  Mainnet Launch (1 month): After successful testing and auditing, we'll deploy the TAO smart contract to the mainnet. We'll host a launch event in Decentraland to celebrate and educate the community.\n\n4.  Virtual Trading Hub Development (2-3 months): Concurrent with the integration with KepingAi trading bot marketplace, we'll start building a virtual trading hub within Decentraland. This hub will serve as a physical representation of Trader's DAO, offering interactive experiences and community events.\n\n5.  KepingAi Integration Trading Bot Marketplace (2-3 months): Connecting the revenue sharing of KepingAi to Trader's DAO for distribution to members.\n\n6.  Marketplace and Virtual Trading Hub Launch (1 month): We'll host a grand launch event in our Decentraland space and provide tutorials and guides for users.\n\nFor long-term transparency and community engagement, we plan to:\n\n*   Share monthly progress reports detailing achievements, challenges, and future plans.\n*   Host quarterly AMA sessions in Decentraland, giving the community a chance to ask questions and provide feedback.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should we remove redundant endpoints from Catalyst? lll",
    "body": "> by 0x6438c3b1fa97ba144ea38fcbcee5f0ccf4539b1d (ph33bs)\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Lambdas service from Catalyst was originally designed to support various independent operations required by the reference implementation client. However, as time progressed, newer and more effective endpoints with identical functions were introduced, yet the service retained all previous iterations.\n\nThis is the third of a serie of proposals that aim to enhance the resilience and efficiency of Catalyst's Lambdas service by optimizing its endpoints and removing old implementations that didn't take performance into consideration, making inefficient use of resources. You may find the first proposal and second proposal of this serie [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=24f524f0-eb50-11ed-ac2d-876c6fc9416f) and [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=709968b0-ef44-11ed-813c-b353c3943eab), respectively.\n\nProvided that this proposal gets general acceptance level, the specified endpoints will be removed one month subsequent to its approval.\n\n### Description\n\nThe main objective of this proposal is to enhance the functionality and usability of the Lambdas service by replacing the **GET /lambdas/collections/wearables-by-owner/:address endpoint** with the **GET /lambdas/users/:address/wearables** endpoint.\n\n### Proposal\n\n**GET /lambdas/collections/wearables-by-owner/:address**\n\nThis endpoint will be replaced with [**GET /lambdas/users/:address/wearables**](https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-api-specs/#tag/Lambdas/operation/getPaginatedWearables) which returns the same data but paginated. This change increases the versatility and scalability of the Lambdas service.\n\n- Delete the endpoint\n- Keep the endpoint\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (LordLike)\n\nShould the problem/opportunity outlined be refined and taken to the next level?\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nCurrently, all the **[Decentraland and DAO documentation](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/what-is-the-dao/)** is in English, which can be challenging for those who are not proficient in the language. They may miss crucial information or find the platform difficult to navigate. By translating these documents into various languages, we can make Decentraland and DAO more accessible to everyone, regardless of their preferred language.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n*   Work with the Community to identify the languages for translation.\n\n*   Initiate a Bids Selection process to secure a professional translation team.\n\n*   After the translations are completed, share them with the Community for feedback, and then make necessary adjustments based on their suggestions.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nThe proposed solution targets non-English speaking Decentraland and DAO members, including but not limited to, gamers, creators, developers, enthusiasts, delegates, investors, and artists. These users need access to accurate, easily understandable documentation in their native languages to avoid misinterpretation of information and to engage more deeply with the Decentraland ecosystem. Offering documentation in multiple languages could also attract new users previously deterred by language barriers.\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nTranslating the Decentraland and DAO documentation into multiple languages will help us connect with more global users who might be limited by language barriers. This initiative could also provide an advantage against other platforms that might already offer, or be planning to offer, multilingual support.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x543dea2479bb8527c71bf4e52802b017212589e6\n\nShould the following $47,000 grant in the Social Media Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal is made by Cryptoast. In a few words, Cryptoast is the first French-speaking media in the field of cryptos, having trained and informed more than 15 million individuals about the stakes of our ecosystem.\n\nCryptoast offers to organize a marketing campaign to highlight Decentraland and bring you a new wave of users. We can offer you :\n\n*   Long articles on our website. This is the mostpowerful format for visibility and long-term notoriety.\n*   News articles that provide a significant boost in visibility.\n*   A custom podcast with an interview with a member of Decentraland.\n*   Handmade videos to discover the universe or meet your team.\n*   Banner integrations on our website or in our newsletter.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n47,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x543Dea2479Bb8527C71bf4E52802B017212589e6\n\n## Email address\n\nlilian@cryptoast.fr\n\n## Description\n\nBefore we go any further, here's some background. Created in 2018, Cryptoast is now the reference in the French-speaking world with several million unique visits per month on the website, nearly 145k subscribers on YouTube (1st crypto media channel), 230k followers on Twitter (the first crypto community on social networks), 50k subscribers to our newsletter and more than 100k listenings per month on our podcasts.\n\nCryptoast is also a partner of BFM Business (TV channel specialized in finance) and Bloomberg which references each article on its terminals. Finally, our live book published by Larousse Editions has sold more than 20,000 copies!\n\nFinally, Cryptoast has built its reputation on a team of experts in their fields. As a journalist, Valentin Demé is the reference in France, as is Vincent Ganne for technical analysis.\n\nCryptoast has already been trusted by the biggest companies in the cryptocurrency industry to run marketing campaigns. In our opinion, this one could give Decentraland a huge boost to consolidate its position as a pioneer in the metaverse, highlight the quality of its product, increase its user base and build loyalty.\n\nIn other words, the benefits we are going to bring you are based on 5 years of brand image built by Cryptoast, making our community trust our word. Our reach is vast, as our statistics (see above) testify.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n*   1st month:\n    A long format article : (5-10k readers, 50k impression on social networks). A presentation, an interview or a report (about 1,500 words). This is the most powerful format for visibility and long-term notoriety, with full coverage on the entire Cryptoast ecosystem (homepage, social networks, newsletter, google news, etc.)\n    A custom made video : (15-50k views, 3k positive interactions). Between 20 and 40 minutes, a visit of Decentraland's offices, discussions around a predefined subject, or a Decentraland gameplay presentation. Full broadcasting on the Cryptoast ecosystem: cryptoast.fr; YouTube; podcast platform; social networks and newsletter.\n\n*   2nd month :\n    A long format article : This article could be a complete tutorial on Decentraland: how to access the universe, what can be done there, etc. It could echo the video, in order to give it a second wind on YouTube.\n    A customized podcast : (50k listenings, 40k impression on social networks). A 20 to 30 minute interview with our journalist, with full broadcast on the Cryptoast ecosystem; YouTube and all podcast platforms (Spotify, etc.). This is our best tool to build awareness and install a long-term brand image.\n\n\\*3rd month :\n2 news article at 2 weeks apart. (2.2k readers, 50k impressions). Full coverage on the entire Cryptoast ecosystem (homepage, social networks, newsletter, google news, etc.)\nDisplay: 1 month of display on our header and sidebar. 3 million unique visitors on the site with a click rate of 0.8%.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xd5c2f48d7b69129354473613c07d60106768ccbe (fungibletaco#ccbe)\n\n[LandWorks](https://landworks.xyz/) is a metaverse land rental marketplace. It’s a product of EnterDAO and was launched with support for Decentraland in January 2022. Since its inception, LandWorks has supported Decentraland LANDs and ESTATEs rentals and so far has accumulated [over 300 rents](https://dune.com/rakis/LandWorks).\n\nThe protocol has been active in the Decentraland community. Last summer LandWorks hosted the [Open Scenes Grant Program](https://landworks.xyz/app/grants-program) where more than $50,000 were rewarded to builders in the Decentraland community for their scene creations. The scenes were also open sources for anyone to use them. We have also purchased a 2x2 ESTATE where we have [our signature scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKZ74OJnwvI) which has already hosted two [parties](https://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=f6480837-0a94-4ac9-bb14-77c294ec51a1) for our community and friends.\n\nWith the recently [enacted proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c98bd010-74b1-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556) by [Nacho](https://governance.decentraland.org/profile/?address=0x87956abC4078a0Cc3b89b419928b857B8AF826Ed) - Decentraland landowners can now keep their VP when engaging in a rental transaction. This has been requested by our landowners community as well and we would like to allow for landowners using LandWorks to keep their VP as well.\n\nOur development team has already created the snapshot strategy based on the enacted proposal. The code is available [here](https://github.com/EnterDAO/snapshot-strategies/tree/decentraland/landworks-rents/src/strategies/decentraland-landworks-rents).\n\nThis could potentially allocate back about 320,000 VP to a small community who have proactively requested to use their VP.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x1b35f4d22b2c8bc706bcfcc383a1ca77fb4fc600 (punkpink)\n\nIn the last 30 days, the DAO has received $20,983 in fees for the new wearables, has paid $5,459 to curators, leaving a profit of $15,524. However, many users do not publish wearables and never will because they do not have sufficient knowledge in 3D modeling.\n\nWe could incentivize the creation of wearables by publishing an add-on repository to facilitate the creation of new original designs with plugins that can be attached to preset designs without having to design them again, something that will serve as an encouragement for those who do not know how to model in 3D.\n\nAdd-on examples:\n\nAccessories such as sleeves, shoulder pads, collars, zippers, buttons, buckles, bows, flowers and other decorative elements with an average of 100 triangles each. These would be available to the community in GLB format and could be attached to wearables from the existing repository.\n\nThese 3 examples share the same upper body however the add-ons along with color variations allow a large number of combinations. (See image: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s-dKBzJi\\_9pPgOJ54-PBHFgbry3zVzCI/view?usp=sharing)\n\nInexperienced users should still learn to join the vertices and export the final result, but it would be much more accessible than designing new objects to complement the wearable, even if they seem capable they could modify the UV textures, although this could be omitted if we publish color variations for each add-on.\n\nBenefits:\n\n*   Facilitate the creation of original wearables.\n*   Attract new creators.\n*   Increase the number of new wearables published.\n*   Increase the income of the DAO.\n\nIf this proposal has a good level of acceptance, I will propose it for a grant that allows it to be developed. On the other hand, if you think it makes sense to do that but you disagree on some point or you have some contribution that can be implemented, we can discuss it together to achieve a better result.\n\nThank you so much.\n\n- YES\n- NO\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Additionally, all code will be open-sourced to the desired specifications of the Decentraland DAO in order to maintain security, decentralization, and transparency for the community.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n64,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x61336bCF79131CEc9955f3884321b00d1EA241Ed\n\n## Email address\n\nalex@solidity.io\n\n## Description\n\nImplementing a Decentraland community-first DEX would be a key step in creating sustainable, on-chain infrastructure for the DAO. As a cash-flow generative and fundamentally Decentraland-backed asset, the DEX would provide a solid DeFi foundation for the ecosystem, and will benefit $MANA holders sustainably into the future.\n\nWith the Decentraland community containing many Web3 users and investors, the utility of an Decentraland DEX will generate significant value for existing holders, incentivize new Decentraland holders to join, bring liquidity providers into the $MANA ecosystem, and will create more demand for $MANA. Additionally, the fees derived from the DEX will serve to increase the DAO treasury value as a whole through DEX revenue.\nThe core of this proposal is centered around our motivation to build for the community, and embrace Web3 values through the implementation of technically sound, user-friendly, DeFi infrastructure.\n\nThe goal of the Decentraland DEX is to create a self-sustaining, cash-flow generative addition of digital infrastructure to the Decentraland ecosystem. Major swaps like Metamask, Uniswap, Sushi, and GMX offer trading fees as high as .875%.\n\nDecentraland DEX will provide: key trading pairs to allow our community to trade with a single DEX UI, competitive/lowest trading fees, charting, integration with other DAO infrastructure, top-of-the-line design and development, and more.\n\n$MANA generates over $100m per day in trading volume on average. If the Decentraland DEX is able to capture just 1% of this volume, the Decentraland treasury could grow by $720,000 over one year. Our proposal represents less than 10% of this cost.\n\n$MANA holders are valuable community members and the target market for DeFi products. Decentraland DEX offers $MANA holders a commercial incentive to support $MANA-backed infrastructure directly benefiting them and the DAO. DEX growth creates a flywheel of incentive for $MANA holders, driving further adoption.\n\nKey value to highlight:\nDEX will attract $MANA liquidity\nDAO establishes core DeFi infrastructure\nRevenue to be directed to Decentraland DAO to increase treasury holdings\nBrings DeFi users into Decentraland\n\nSpecifications |\nSolidity.io 2 will design, develop, and deploy a decentralized exchange for the Decentraland DEX. The DEX will utilize modified Uniswap v2 core contracts to enable the decentralized exchange of ERC-20 tokens. All data points from the DEX will be aggregated to a decentralized datastore to enable real-time charting on the platform.\nUtilizing the customized Uniswap v2 contracts, an exchange SDK will be created to allow for an easy swaps of assets.\nThe SDK will enable Decentraland builders to integrate native swaps on core Decentraland infrastructure. Builders will be free to skin the SDK into other core Decentraland infrastructure, allowing accessibility across the Decentraland community. This offers a new tool for platform developers to create innovative applications and integrations.\nUsers can swap in and out of tokens utilizing the platform’s liquidity to perform transactions. The swap will display relevant information, including price impact, slippage, and deadline. In addition to swap, users will be able to add liquidity to pairs, this process will be a separate flow allowing users to customize their transaction.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nSpecifications |\nSolidity.io 2 will design, develop, and deploy a decentralized exchange for the Decentraland DEX.

    "body": "> by 0x751c4e9b2c75a2d4e3442e0a06a67bf0bb02060a (viisikanta)\n\nWe propose the creation of a Decentraland Ambassador Program that will empower community members to organize global meetups and raise awareness about Decentraland. This initiative involves selecting up to 10 official community representatives (ambassadors) who will host regular Decentraland Meetups across the globe. These ambassadors will be responsible for local event organization, swag giveaways, and representing Decentraland at other relevant events.\n\nThe goal of this program is to increase awareness of Decentraland, strengthen the existing community, and onboard and inspire new members to join the platform and DAO. The total desired funding for this project is around $57,000, which will cover the Program Manager's compensation, swag production, and meetup costs for up to 30 events over a 7-month period. This budget breakdown ensures that each ambassador has the resources necessary to organize quality events.\n\nThe ideator team collaborating on this proposal includes:\n\n*   Marja Konttinen, former Marketing Director at Decentraland Foundation, acting as proposal’s Program Manager\n    with ideas and help from:\n*   Yemel Jardi, Executive Director, Decentraland Foundation\n*   Gino, DCL DAO Product Lead\n*   Peanutbutta, Community Manager, Decentraland Foundation\n\nWe would like to gauge community feedback and determine if there is enough support to move forward with drafting a program proposal. We ask you to vote on the following question:\n\nDo you support the creation of the Decentraland Ambassador Program, which would empower community members to organize global meetups and raise awareness about Decentraland?\n\nYour feedback and participation in the voting are greatly appreciated.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

We believe that our project deserves funding because it offers a fun and accessible gaming experience that appeals to a wide audience, while also enhancing the social and cultural fabric of the platform.\n\nOne of the key problems that our project will solve is the lack of engaging and accessible gaming experiences in Decentraland. Many of the current games and activities in Decentraland are geared towards more experienced users, and can be difficult for newcomers to understand and enjoy. By bringing the classic game of Bingo to Decentraland, we aim to offer a gaming experience that is easy to understand, fun to play, and has the potential to attract a large and diverse user base.\n\nIn addition to providing a fun and engaging gaming experience, our project will also bring several benefits to the Decentraland platform. First, it will contribute to the growth and development of the Decentraland economy by generating revenue through ticket sales, partnerships, and other monetization strategies. Second, it will enhance the social and cultural experience of the platform by providing a space where users can come together, meet new people, and enjoy a shared gaming experience. Finally, it will help to establish Decentraland as a platform that offers a wide range of accessible and engaging gaming experiences, which will attract new users and contribute to the long-term success and sustainability of the platform.\n\nIn summary, the Bingo Hall is a unique and exciting project that deserves funding because it offers a fun and accessible gaming experience, solves a key problem in the Decentraland ecosystem, and brings several benefits to the platform. We believe that our team has the skills and experience necessary to deliver a high-quality product that will make a positive contribution to the Decentraland community and ecosystem.\n\nSide note to community:\nFeel free to contact me if you are interested in supporting this project.

    "body": "> by 0x56469159d91eb810dce34dd13ec4ed8194bca7be (NikkiFuego)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should the DAO increase Polygon GWEI Threshold?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a7327de0-e2dc-11ed-ae6b-bdc7e2b26a35)\n\n## Summary\n\nFor the past several months, Polygon GWEI has been out of control. Currently, the threshold for \"free\" gas to the consumer is 150 GWEI. Meaning that anytime GWEI is higher than 150, Decentraland provided services fail.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nHaving a marketplace and platform that provides free gas to its users is a huge selling point when onboarding new users and builders. When an entire quarter goes by where GWEI is consistently above 150, that selling point becomes obsolete.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nSome examples of Decentraland services that fail when GWEI is above 150 are:\n\n*   Purchasing - Both primary and secondary purchases.\n*   Transferring - Sending wearables to other wallets.\n*   Minting\n*   Publishing - As well as adding minters/collaborators and putting items *on sale*.\n*   L2 Services - Air-dropping wearables or transferring MANA with Decentralands script. This directly impacts Play-to-Earn games.\n\nIn some cases, with purchases in-game on LAND or in Play-to-Earn games, the user does not have the option to swap to Polygon Network because that results in them disconnecting from the in-game experience as that requires a constant connection to Ethereum Network.\n\nIt's a huge red flag for new users. I know when I started out I had very little knowledge of what GWEI was and how it worked exactly. A lot of new users likely do not own MATIC or know to purchase it. Therefore the **sales conversion funnel that the foundation spends enormous amounts of effort on fails**.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nCurrently, the DAO covers these gas costs and the average is $1k-$2k USD worth of Matic spent each month on Polygon GWEI (data provided by HP).\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis draft is to increase the threshold from 150 to 300 to meet the new standard norm that we've been experiencing for the last few months. While GWEI can still go higher than this amount, this should help increase the number of free transactions drastically.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Create a specific category for LAND related matters on the DAO proposal page named \"LAND\".\n\nRefer to Annex (A)\n\n2.  All proposals will be decided on a case by case basis, including the permitted tenure as well as whether cost is involved.\n\nRefer to Annex (B) and (C)\n\n3.  The 'Acceptance Threshold' should be set at 2m Voting Power for 1 parcel, and thereafter, a  dynamic threshold is triggered.\n\nRefer to Annex (D)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the successful passing and subsequent enacting of the LAND purchase agreement by the DAO, infrastructure should be set up to allow all members to start using LAND.\n\nThrough various consultations held in the past month, the DAO has come to an agreement to set up a process in which potential tenants can submit proposals.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThere are 4 key goals to be achieved with this proposal.\n\n1.  Create a specific category for LAND related matters on the DAO proposal page named \"LAND\".\n\n2.  Implement an application form format for potential tenants.\n    The form will include categories such as location, title, purpose, amount of time to be occupied, rent payable PER DAY during occupancy (if any) and other information.\n\n3.  Set the 'Acceptance Threshold' at 2m VP for the 1st parcel and 200k VP for each of the remaining parcels thereafter.\n    It'll work out as follows:\n\n1plot: 2m VP\n\n2 plots and above: 2m VP + \\[(total plots-1) x 200k VP].\nFor example, 6 plots will be 3m VP.\n\nA ceiling of 6m VP will be applied (similar to governance proposal or a grant that requires $100k)\n\n4.  Proposals for the use or revocation of LAND need only go through 1 round of application, similar to POIs.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith the governance proposal for LAND purchase enacting soon, setting up the infrastructure for use of LAND is the next step. This will ensure that a proper process is present to prevent confusion as to how applications for use works.\n\nAnnex (A)\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b2344a30-e6af-11ed-b8f1-75dbe089d333\n\nAnnex (B)\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a1e99ae0-e6af-11ed-b8f1-75dbe089d333\n\nAnnex (C)\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8acd2980-e6af-11ed-b8f1-75dbe089d333\n\nAnnex (D)\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d36e9660-e957-11ed-a775-5faf35384fa8\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

(requirements, qualifications etc.)\n\n*   Should SAB members receive compensation, and if so, how ? (on monthly or performance base)\n\n*   Should there be additional documentation and guidelines on SAB operations ?\n\n*   Should there be reports or updates from the SAB to the Community, and if so, when and in what form ?\n\n*   Should SAB members be interviewed by the Community or specific DAO Core Units once a certain period of time ?

    "title": "Should we remove redundant endpoints from Catalyst? ll",
    "body": "> by 0x6438c3b1fa97ba144ea38fcbcee5f0ccf4539b1d (ph33bs)\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Lambdas service from Catalyst was originally designed to support various independent operations required by the reference implementation client. However, as time progressed, newer and more effective endpoints with identical functions were introduced, yet the service retained all previous iterations.\n\nThis is the second of a serie of proposals that aim to enhance the resilience and efficiency of Catalyst's Lambdas service by optimizing its endpoints and removing old implementations that didn't take performance into consideration, making inefficient use of resources. You may find the first proposal of this serie [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=24f524f0-eb50-11ed-ac2d-876c6fc9416f).\n\nThe main objective of this proposal is to decrease the overhead of the Lambdas service and improve Catalyst response times by removing the redundant endpoints GET /lambdas/contentv2/contents/:cid, GET  /lambdas/contentv2/scenes, and GET /lambdas/contentv2/parcel_info.\n\n### Proposal\n\n**GET /lambdas/contentv2/contents/:cid**\n\nThis endpoint is currently acting as a proxy, forwarding the initial request to the *GET /contents/:cid* endpoint of the Content service and returning its response without any additional formatting. Going forward, clients should access the [GET /content/contents/:cid endpoint](https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-api-specs/#tag/Content-Server/operation/getContentFile) from content-server directly.\n\n**GET  /lambdas/contentv2/scenes**\n\nThis endpoint is currently acting as a proxy, forwarding the initial request to the *POST /content/entities/active* endpoint of the content-server and returning its response without any additional formatting. Going forward, clients should access the [POST /content/entities/active endpoint](https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-api-specs/#tag/Content-Server/operation/getListOfEntities) from content-server directly.\n\n**GET /lambdas/contentv2/parcel_info**\n\nThis endpoint is also acting as a proxy, forwarding the initial request to the *POST /content/entities/active* endpoint of the content-server and returning its response without any additional formatting. Going forward, clients should access the [POST /content/entities/active endpoint](https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-api-specs/#tag/Content-Server/operation/getListOfEntities) from content-server directly.\n\nProvided that this proposal gets general acceptance level, the specified endpoints will be removed one month subsequent to its approval.\n\n- Delete the endpoints\n- Keep the endpoints\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Formal Pathway for DAO Request for Information (RFI) from the Foundation",
    "body": "> by 0x5b5cc427c1d81db4f94de4d51d85ce122d63e244 (Fehz)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Formal Pathway for DAO Request for Information (RFI) from the Foundation](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=33425da0-e2ec-11ed-ae6b-bdc7e2b26a35)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal outlines a process to implement a formal pathway for the DAO to issue a “request for information” (RFI) from the Decentraland Foundation.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe RFI process between Decentraland DAO and the Decentraland Foundation is designed to increase communication and collaboration between both entities. The RFI process will create a mechanism for the DAO to issue a formal request for information from the Foundation within a series of defined categories, which would require a formal statement from the Foundation in response. While the responses will be non-binding, this process will allow for the DAO to more efficiently communicate its, and help alleviate information asymmetry between the two core entities of the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDecentraland is a progressively decentralizing ecosystem, managed by two core stakeholders: the Decentraland DAO and the Decentraland Foundation. While both of these entities are themselves made up of a diverse and multi-interested group of stakeholders, a cooperative and structured institutional relationship between the DAO and the Foundation is beneficial, if not necessary to the success of our metaversal “way of life.”\n\nThe most important proposal to date outlining a formal relationship between the DAO and the Foundation was recently passed as a Binding Governance Proposal, delegating responsibility for determining and implementing the “reference client roadmap” to the Decentraland Foundation.”\n\nIn the reference client proposal, the Decentraland Foundation notes the following key point: “The project is currently in a state of asymmetry in terms of context/resources/contributions between the Foundation and the community.”\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal aims to establish a pathway for the DAO to issue a “Request for Information” (RFI) from the Decentraland Foundation via the DAO’s governance dApp and/or other complementary tools. A DAO RFI can be on any topic of interest or concern, and if passed, will require a formal statement of response from the Decentraland Foundation. While any response to an RFI will be non-binding, this is an important mechanism for the DAO to communicate its interests and alleviate information “asymmetry” between the Foundation and the Community.\n\n1.  **General Guidelines -** An RFI can be useful when there is necessary information which you do not currently have access to. An RFI can be about the “what”, “why” and/or “how” of a specific topic. It is highly recommended to limit the request and to be specific about what information is being requested in order to optimize the document for brevity, as this will allow the Foundation to read and digest the information in less time without omitting key data points.\n2.  **Restraints** - There may be certain topics that the Foundation is not willing or able to disclose in detail, and may provide only high-level answers or limited information. This includes the following:\n    1.  Revealing personal information about contractors and users.\n    2.  Details about contractor’s compensation and other contract details.\n    3.  Organizational chart of the Foundation and internal functioning.\n    4.  Legal issues related to the legal structure.\n3.  **Liaison (DAO-Foundation)**- DAO Facilitation Squad will serve as an Entries & Support Desk (ESD) to organize, prioritize, forward the questionnaires, and reach out to the Foundation technical areas. Meaning that the ESD will be responsible for managing a pipeline for all RFI, help with their writing and for verifying the feasibility of getting answers.\n4.  **Channel & Functioning**:\n    1.  The main channel for submitting RFIs and getting responses will be a Category created on the Forum for setting up the ESD.\n    2.  Each thread created within the RFI Category will remain open for a continuous period of 45 days for community members to submit their questions through the template form. The ESD Facilitator will moderate these threads and will possess the authority to remove posts that are not relevant to the RFI form.\n    3.  The questions submitted by the community will be ranked based on the number of votes/likes received within a period of 15 days after the first stage is closed. This ranking will determine the priority of the questions/topics for the community, and the questions with the most votes/likes will be forwarded to the Foundation.\n    4.  Once the current round of submissions is complete, another round will be opened to allow community members to pose their questions.\n    5.  The process must allow sufficient time for responses and provide an appropriate deadline for the Decentraland Foundation to respond to the RFIs. As a standard, the Foundation will have a 45 days period to send a response, considering the necessary time to gather and compile all relevant information and documentation.\n    6.  Time Extensions: If the Foundation considers that the posed questions are complex or require extensive research or analysis, will be able to ask for a time extension.\n    7.  Publishing: The response will be public and available for everyone through official channels such as the Governance dApp, social media, and/or other communication channels and complementary apps.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe RFI procedure will allow the community to access information that they may not have had access to previously, increasing transparency between the Decentraland Foundation and the DAO by providing a concrete mechanism and pathway. With the expressed timelines, the community will have 6 RFI rounds every year. The RFI procedure will also serve as a complementary tool to the AMA Sessions.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n1.  Create a dedicated category on the Decentraland Forum for submitting RFIs and getting responses.\n\n2.  Give administrator permissions to the Facilitation Squad to manage the Forum category.\n\n3.  Set up a space to ensure that the responses to the RFIs are made public and available to everyone through the dApp or complementary tools.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed RFI process aims to establish a cooperative and structured institutional relationship between the DAO and the Foundation, benefiting the success of Decentraland's metaverse. The process will enable the DAO to communicate its interests, alleviate information asymmetry, and allow the Foundation to respond to community concerns and suggestions in a transparent and accountable manner.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The team was able to understand their needs, identified in the last 6 month period 15 blockers and 55 requests (2 being solved by the team) and provided solutions to them.\nWe wrote the [grant's FAQs](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/grants-faq/) to the DAO documentation, added [security recommendations](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/security-recommendations/), we contributed to [17 AskMeAnything sessions](https://www.notion.so/decentraland/Decentraland-Foundation-Technical-AMA-230fcf1ca1ec4d49922744fe91e6995d) to connect the community with the Decentraland Foundation since Oct 2022. More recently, in March 2023 we have launched the **Testing Tuesday Initiative**, to give the grantees a space to demo their projects and get feedback from the community. So far we have hosted 11 sessions, and we’ve given POAPs to the community as a way to acknowledge their valuable contributions. We would like to continue **updating the documentation** and fostering spaces of collaboration between the Decentraland DAO and Decentraland Foundation, and provide support to the grantees in these or other initiatives that might arise based on their needs.\n\nAnother frequent request from our grantees has been **promotion**. We hired a copywriter (Luis Mienville) who so far had written [13 articles](https://decentraland.org/blog/author/decentraland-dao) in the Decentraland Blog about the amazing work our grantees are doing. We also encouraged grantees to show their progress in our **bi-weekly Townhalls**. Since September, we have an average of 3 grantees showing their progress in each Town Hall, who create videos and socialize with the community their advancements. We would like to continue nurturing these spaces of promotion, which are crucial to showcase their work.\n\nTo take care of the community treasury, we have recommended to the DAO committee to revoke grants that were delayed, not delivering their grant projects, or unable to finish due to technical blockers, until they can deliver their commitment with the DAO. In our last grant, **we had recovered** $565.842, and since then, 3 grant vesting contracts were resumed as they resolved their blockers, recovering from legacy revoked grants $181.619, and $75.000 from the renewed grants program adding a total of  **$256.619 to the DAO treasury** during this first year. We are creating a **Revocation Committee** to distribute this responsibility with selected members of the community.\n\nLast but not least, we have collaborated with the DAO Facilitation Squad and the DAO Governance Squad to provide them with continuous feedback and partner with them to generate synergy among our efforts to build transparency in the community via promotion and the governance dApp respectively. We’ve also collaborated providing insights to the DAO Committee to restructure the grants program.\n\nWe’d love to continue improve our grants program not only with the grantees, but with the broader Decentraland systems, and applying ongoing changes to better serve Decentraland’s sustainable growth.\n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15YQ3alNtXDXxehMRvgS5\\_ZOzMl_RgiMsGQ8IwOOJSmI/edit#gid=1600802421) you can see our financial report (jan22-apr23)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**We will continue working on**\n\n*   Grantees onboarding\n*   Generate public roadmaps\n*   Frequent calls based on project size\n*   Collaborate with the  Governance Squad, DAO Committee and Facilitation Squad.\n*   Organize & host grants section in TownHalls\n*   Provide technical support to grantees connecting them with stakeholders from the community and from the Decentraland Foundation.\n*   Provide space to share their work and gather feedback from the community with Testing Tuesdays\n*   Implement the strategic path of grants “exits” to nurture  Decentraland (as verified partners, advisors, grant renewals, service providers)\n*   Collaborate with bidding and tendering process\n\nDuring these 6 months, we've had learnings and **would like to implement**:\n\n**Provide Support to grantees**\n\n*   Develop a Landing Page to ease the access of information about the Decentraland Grants Program and its initiatives.\n*   Sending Decentraland DAO branded kits of swag to welcome future grantees, and help brand awareness.\n\n**Foster transparency**\n\n*   Implementation of Public Roadmaps to open up our follow up process as GSS with the rest of the community.\n*   We are documenting all our processes and want to create the open  Operational Guide of the GSS\n\n**Take care of the DAO treasury**\n\n*   Onboard the Revocations Committee selected by the community and support them until they are autonomous.\n*   Support Bidding and Tendering initiative, sharing our knowledge and resources with its stewards.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Term limits for Grant Support Squad ( DRAFT )",
    "body": "> by 0xed0e0cb94f60f72ec94bef848f5df4cbd365af1d (DuelArena)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should We Set Term Limits for Grant Support Squad?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=858970d0-b7a4-11ed-9cbc-e93d98a2df52)\n\n## Summary\n\nImplement term limits for the Grant Support Squad to ensure accountability, foster fresh perspectives, and promote transparency and impartiality in decision-making processes within the Decentraland community.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal advocates for the implementation of term limits and regularly scheduled elections for the Grant Support Squad in Decentraland. By introducing term limits, the Squad can avoid potential issues such as a lack of accountability, stagnation of ideas, and a disconnect from the community's needs. This framework aims to promote fairness, diversity, and effectiveness in the decision-making processes of the Grant Support Squad.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe absence of term limits for the Grant Support Squad in Decentraland can lead to several potential issues. Without a set duration, accountability may be compromised, fresh perspectives may be lacking, and concerns about impartiality may arise. Furthermore, the lack of term limits could discourage democratic participation and result in a disconnection between the Squad and the community it serves. To address these concerns, implementing term limits is crucial.\n\n*   Maximum Term Duration: Set a Maximum duration of 1 year for each term served by a member of the Grant Support Squad.\n*   Term Limits and Reapplication: Specify the number of consecutive terms a member can serve on the Grant Support Squad before they must reapply for their position. For instance, after two consecutive terms, members must reapply and compete with other qualified candidates to ensure a fair selection process.\n*   Rotation Schedule: Implement a regular rotation schedule for the Grant Support Squad. Determine the frequency of elections and rotations to ensure a consistent influx of new members and prevent stagnation within the Squad.\n*   Transparency in Selection Process: Establish transparent criteria and guidelines for selecting new members of the Grant Support Squad. This can include qualifications, experience, and a fair evaluation process to ensure that the most suitable individuals are chosen.\n*   Community Engagement: Encourage community participation and input in the selection process. Consider allowing community members to nominate candidates or provide feedback on potential candidates to ensure that the Grant Support Squad represents the diverse interests and perspectives of the Decentraland community.\n*   Term Evaluation:In addition to conducting periodic evaluations of the performance of Grant Support Squad (GSS) members during their terms, it is crucial to establish a transparent and accountable process for their selection and continued service. To ensure accountability and maintain the trust of the community, it is recommended that GSS members be subject to a voting process for a one-year term.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Elections & Vote of Confidence**\n\nAt the end of the six-month mark within the one-year term, a vote of confidence through a poll should be held to evaluate the ongoing suitability of the GSS member in their role. This vote of confidence serves as an opportunity for the community to assess the member's performance, effectiveness, and alignment with the community's best interests. By conducting this vote, the community can make an informed decision about the member's continuation in the GSS, ensuring that only individuals who consistently contribute to the goals of the Decentraland project remain in positions of responsibility.\n\nReason for conducting the vote of confidence: The vote of confidence allows the community to actively participate in the evaluation process and voice their opinions regarding the performance and effectiveness of GSS members. It serves as a mechanism to address any concerns, maintain transparency, and ensure that the appointed individuals are consistently working in the best interests of the community. This process helps to maintain a high standard of accountability and fosters trust within the Decentraland project.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nImplementing term limits for the Grant Support Squad in Decentraland is necessary to address potential issues such as a lack of accountability, fresh perspectives, and trust in the decision-making processes. By introducing term limits, the community can foster fairness, diversity, and transparency in the Grant Support Squad, ensuring it remains responsive, accountable, and effective over the long term. This proposal aims to promote a healthier and more inclusive governance process within the Decentraland community\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should we remove redundant endpoints from Catalyst?",
    "body": "> by 0x6438c3b1fa97ba144ea38fcbcee5f0ccf4539b1d (ph33bs)\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Lambdas service from Catalyst was originally designed to support various independent operations required by the reference implementation client. However, as time progressed, newer and more effective endpoints with identical functions were introduced, yet the service retained all previous iterations.\n\nThis is the first of a serie of proposals that aim to enhance the resilience and efficiency of Catalyst's Lambdas service by optimizing its endpoints and removing old implementations that didn't take performance into consideration, making inefficient use of resources.\n\nThe main objective of this proposal is to decrease the overhead and improve the functionality of the Lambdas service by removing the now obsolete GET /lambdas/health and the redundant GET /lambdas/profile endpoints.\n\n### Proposal\n\n**GET /lambdas/health**\n\nThis health endpoint was designed to handle the responsibility of reporting the status of every catalyst service, which was not an appropriate use case, thereby it will be replaced with the [Realm-Description /about endpoint](https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-api-specs/#tag/Global/operation/getAboutCatalystInfo) specified on [ADR-110: Realm description](https://adr.decentraland.org/adr/ADR-110).\n\n**GET /lambdas/profiles**\n\nThe usage of this endpoint can be replaced by [POST /lambdas/profiles](https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-api-specs/#tag/Lambdas/operation/getAvatarsDetailsByPost) which has no limitations regarding the amount of profiles you can request. From now on, the IDs to be included in the request body instead of as query strings. This change aims to address the URL length limitation issue and allow clients to request multiple profiles simultaneously, thereby enhancing the versatility and scalability of the service.\n\nProvided that this proposal gets general acceptance level, the specified endpoints will be removed one month subsequent to its approval.\n\n- Delete the endpoints\n- Keep the endpoints\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Thereafter, a simply majority is required for the proposal to pass.\n\nI'd like the community's feedback on what the voting threshold should be if a member (including the DAO squads) wants to apply to use land that is acquired by the DAO.\n\nPLEASE NOTE that this is for 1 plot of LAND\n\nFactors to consider:\n\n*   1 LAND's value is capped at around 4k MANA, comparable to a grant that's asking for 2.5k USD at today's prices.\n\n*   The potential supply of land that'll be available to the community. It is estimated that there could be an average of 10-15 LANDs purchased per month.\n\n*   Whether VP threshold should be dynamic, i.e 1m VP for the first plot, extra 500k VP for every extra plot included in the proposal, regardless of whether its contiguous.\n\nBearing in mind that setting too low a threshold (500k vp and below) will allow a single person to legitimise the voting process while too high a threshold will discourage a lot of members from applying if the failure rate is high.\n\n- 500k VP\n- 1m VP\n- 2m VP\n- 3m VP\n- Dynamic Threshold\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "CO-OP: EDUCATIONAL ELECTRONICS SANDBOX",
    "body": "> by 0xc24789c6f165329290ddd3fbeac3b6842a294003 (TheCryptoTrader)\n\nShould the following $12,100 grant in the Documentation category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nI am submitting this grant proposal to fund a student co-op work term, with the aim of creating an open-source electronics sandbox scene. By collaborating with students and academic institutions through their co-op programs, we can produce educational content at a lower cost while also introducing and training more creators for our platform. Additionally, this project will provide valuable insights into the entry-point developer experience, which will help us improve our platform and attract more users in the long run.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n12,100 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n4 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003\n\n## Email address\n\nthecryptotrader69@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe proposed project is a 3-month co-op position for a CompSci student to develop a Decentraland scene that educates users on electronic components. Proposals like this could prove invaluable by utilising inexpensive hires, training future creators, and adding to the amount of educational content available on Decentraland. If we can manage to utilise co-ops successfully we could quickly populate Decentraland with a myriad of educational experiences and open-source development examples.\n\nI have already conducted research on the requirements for submitting a job posting, my business is registered on the required educator websites, and the job posting is ready to be submitted. Here’s a quick breakdown of the fundamental requirements for a co-op position:\n\n*   The position must offer at least 420 hours worth of work.\n*   The work done by the student must reflect at least 40% of their targeted field. This means that the work must be relevant, such as software development or systems design for a computer science student.\n*   Most work terms also provide compensation between $18 to $25 an hour in order to attract students to their posting.\n*   Job postings are nearly always submitted by a business (not an individual).\n\nIn addition to the above requirements, students are expected to document their progress and experience through journaling, attend regular meetings with their work supervisor and campus faculty, and provide a summary of their experience and what they learned during the work term.\n\nWith these requirements in mind, I've designed this grant to facilitate the management of a project geared towards a single computer science student. The project will take place over a 3-month period from June to August, with the student receiving compensation of $20/h. The student will be developing a Decentraland scene meant to educate users on electronic components, adding to the amount of educational content available on the platform.\nThe scene would be composed of two parts:\n\n*   A sandbox simulation where users can play with a breadboard and add or remove electronic components such as LEDs, capacitors, switches, and logic gates.\n*   A guided educational experience that walks through each component and how it works with an example orientation of how to make use of that component.\n\nI was also considering the possibility of a puzzle generator that produces layouts that need to be solved with the components provided. For example, users could be challenged to turn on the green LED while keeping the red LED off. However, this feature may be relegated to a stretch goal to be targeted if the student shows a good aptitude for development.\n\nOverall, this project has the potential to be a valuable learning experience for the student and could help them stand out in the competitive job market. Additionally, it could contribute to the development of educational content on the Decentraland platform and help bring new users into the world of blockchain technology.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n#### Stage 0 - Viability:\n\nTo ensure the success of our co-op project, I have reached out to nearby universities and colleges to gather information about their co-op programs and how to design a mutually beneficial project for both the student and the employer.\n\n#### Stage 1 - Job Posting & Recruitment (May to June):\n\nI plan to post the job advertisement in May to recruit a suitable co-op student for the project. Based on the co-op program requirements, the position offers a minimum of 420 hours of work and competitive compensation at $20 (CAD) per hour. As many students struggle to secure co-op positions through job postings (there are usually far more students than postings), I expect to receive a good number of responses to the job posting.\n\n#### Stage 2 - Project Execution (June to August):\n\nDuring this time the hired student will be trained and set to course developing the electronics sandbox. To ensure the quality of the code created, there will be regular code-reviews. Interviews/check-ins are also conducted with the institution.\n\n#### STAGE 3 - Wrap-Up and Exit Interview (August)\n\nUpon the completion of the work term an exit interview will be conducted to discuss their experiences while developing the Decentraland scene and a 3 to 5-minute video will be produced outlining how to use the sandbox. These deliverables will help us evaluate the success of the project and gather insights into the student's experience when developing for Decentraland.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\nThis is a follow-up proposal regarding \"[Should Decentraland Worlds be integrated with Events and Places?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4fcffbc0-b9d0-11ed-8c13-518b5c1940be)\" and \"[Should Decentraland Worlds be integrated with Places?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f9573010-d22f-11ed-9cb9-2563bc989482)\".\n\nBased on conversations with some LAND owners and Foundation’s core developers, we have come up with a two-fold strategy.\n\n1.  \\[This poll] A *short-term plan* to implement right away if it gets a general acceptance level.\n2.  \\[[Second Poll](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c3216070-e822-11ed-b8f1-75dbe089d333)] A *long-term plan* should go through the three-stage governance process.\n\n### Short-term Plan\n\nTo increase the adoption and utility of Decentraland Worlds, and to encourage more creators to publish content utilizing the Decentraland platform, an integration between Worlds with [ Places](http://places.decentraland.org/) ,  [Events](http://events.decentraland.org/)  and  [the Explorer](http://play.decentraland.org/)  is proposed.\n\n#### Description\n\n*   Allow discoverability of Worlds deployed to Foundation’s World Content Server *only for NAME owners that also hold LAND or an active LAND rental contract*.\n\n*   The World Content Server will expose a list of “discoverable” worlds and it will be used by other products such as  [Events](http://events.decentraland.org/) ,  [Places](http://places.decentraland.org/)  and the  [Explorer](http://play.decentraland.org/) .\n\n*   Creators will be able to opt out of this functionality at the moment of deploying their world via settings in the *scene.json* file.\n\n#### Rationale\n\nDecentraland Foundation team is leading the development of the World Content Server and enabling the discoverability of Worlds is an important milestone to reach. There is some considerable engineering effort required and this is a great timing for the team to do it.\n\nLimiting discoverability to LAND owners and tenants allows Foundation to implement and test the feature while preserving the economics of the LAND market. It also encourages the world owner to build a portal from Genesis City to the World to bring more traffic.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThis poll aims to test the community sentiment about enabling the discoverability of Worlds owned by LAND holders and tenants. It will be implemented if the poll receives general support.\n\nThere is also an ongoing conversation, about how [the long-term support of Worlds](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c3216070-e822-11ed-b8f1-75dbe089d333) should work.  Those issues should be discussed in *this other proposal* and go through the three-stage governance process.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Worlds 2.0 - Long-Term Plan",
    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\n### Introduction\n\nDecentraland is an open protocol to power the immersive internet, also known as the Metaverse. It is compounded by different types of user-generated experiences:\n\n#### Public Experience (LAND)\n\nA group of user-generated experiences arranged in a map, alongside roads and plazas, creating Genesis City, the first public good of the Metaverse. These public experiences receive visitors by foot traffic. Access to publishing such scenes is granted by owning or renting LAND tokens. The content of the experiences is hosted and replicated in Decentraland’s content network.\n\n#### Private Experience (WORLDs)\n\nAll citizens of the metaverse have the right to own a World, a private space where you can free your imagination. A place to build your home or private room, in which you can control your surroundings and have access control. The content of the experience is hosted by the official World Content Server or self-hosted by the creator in their own instance.\n\n#### Portable Experiences (WEARABLES)\n\nA user-generated creation that affects the player experience, such as a fancy hat attached to your avatar, or some sweet moves to make your avatar dance, or a compass that guides you to the next adventure. Access to such experiences is granted by owning an NFT. The content of the experience is curated by the DAO and hosted on Decentraland’s content network.\n\n### Worlds Beta\n\nWhile LAND and WEARABLES have been around for a time now, Worlds was recently introduced in December 2022 by Decentraland Foundation with the goal of lowering the entry barriers for builders. Without this initiative, creators need to pay a high ticket to access LAND or go to competitor platforms.\nThe beta launch included the release of an open-source World Content Server and provided an official instance accepting deployments of Worlds. The summary of the released feature is:\n\n*   Creator needs a NAME to deploy a World.\n*   Experience size is limited by asset storage (100MB).\n*   Players can teleport to a World or use a direct link.\n*   Creators can spin up their own World Content Server.\n*   Worlds are not discoverable via Places, Events, and the Explorer.\n\nThe beta had the goal to test the technical implementation and gather community feedback about how to integrate Worlds into the Decentraland ecosystem. The Decentraland Foundation hosted a special AMA and published two proposals in the DAO to address the discoverability topic.\n\nThe community expressed their support of Worlds and acknowledged the potential to accomplish the goal of lowering the entry barrier and unleashing the creator’s creativity. However, the feature generated some discomfort among LAND holders because of the unlimited nature of private spaces being created in Worlds.\nThe ideal solution to the barrier to entry problem also takes into consideration the long-term interests of LAND owners and overall Decentraland economics.\n\n### Worlds 2.0 - Long-term plan\n\nEvery metaverse citizen should be able to have a private space in Decentraland, however the size of a world should grow based on how much they are involved in Decentraland’s ecosystem.\n\nThe genesis of virtual space in Decentraland can be traced back to the formation of Genesis City. During the Terraform Event, LAND was auctioned and millions of MANA proceeds were burned.\n\nFollowing this precedent, the creation of a World, as isolated spaces, should require some sort of skin-in-the-game. The strategy could be laid out in a way that is very friendly to newcomers but also incentivizes them to get more involved in the ecosystem.\n\n#### Summary\n\nAny Ethereum address can make a signed deployment to the World Content Server, the only requirement is to have an ENS domain name (as cheap as $5 USD per year). They will get a 25 MB limit for their experience and in order to make it bigger they will need a DCL Name or LAND or MANA.\n\n*   ENS domain holders have access to 25 MB of storage.\n*   Decentraland Name holders have access to 100 MB.\n*   LAND and ESTATE holders have access to a 100 MB space per LAND.\n*   Holding 2,000 MANA gives you access to 100 MB of space.\n\nFor example, if a creator holds a Decentraland NAME, 1 LAND, and 500 MANA, they will have 225 MB of storage available in the World Content Server. The creators can deploy one big world or many tiny ones but never use more than 225 MB of storage.\n\n#### World Size Limit\n\nThe recommendation is to limit the total storage of a World Content Server for a particular address based on the assets it holds. To have a reference, the Decentraland’s content network limits Genesis City experiences to 25 MB per parcel.\n\n#### ENS Names\n\nWorlds deployments are associated with Decentraland NAMEs, which are based on the ENS protocol, one of the biggest and most successful projects in Ethereum. The recommendation is to allow deployments of Worlds to any ENS name holder, but limited to a 25 MB experience.\n\nThis will provide a value proposition for the 600k unique name owners and invite them to create their own (small) world in the metaverse.\n\n#### Decentraland NAMEs\n\nThe current version of Worlds (beta) already accepts deployments from NAME owners and limits the size to 100 MB (equivalent to 4 parcels in Genesis City). The recommendation is to keep the storage quota as is.\n\n#### LANDs and ESTATES\n\nThe recommendation is that a LAND owner will receive a storage quota in the World Content Server equivalent to 100 MB per parcel owned.\n\n#### MANA\n\nFollowing the same relation used in DAO’s Voting Power scheme: 2,000 MANA = 1 LAND = 2,000 VP.  The recommendation is to give a quota of 100 MB per each 2,000 MANA held by the account.\n\n#### Official World Content Server\n\nTruth be told, the restrictions of the space limits can only be enforced in the World Content Server hosted by the Foundation. Anyone has the freedom to run their own instance and host private content there which will still be accessible through Decentraland Explorer.\n\nThe recommendation is the Reference Client should warn the user that is about to jump into an unofficial server. The DAO could eventually maintain a list of official World Content Servers that follow the limitations and moderation policies demanded by the DAO.\n\n#### Discoverability in Events and Places\n\nDiscoverability of Worlds in Events and Places should be limited to LAND owners and tenants. This will encourage the connection between Genesis City and Worlds through in-world portals.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe proposal aims to address the discoverability and entry barrier problems faced by creators in the Decentraland Metaverse. By providing different storage quotas based on the user's involvement in the ecosystem, the proposal incentivizes users to get more involved while also taking into consideration the long-term interests of LAND owners and overall Decentraland economics.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "[Resubmission] Butterfly Prawn Farm (BPF) Development and Expansion",
    "body": "> by 0x017fbadca2dbc267bb046624f23831662a6fd718 (BPVerse)\n\nShould the following $90,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAt Butterfly Prawn Farm (BPF), we created an unprecedented Free-To-Play (F2P), Play-to-Earn (P2E) farm game, where players AKA farmers can harvest plants, collect resources and compete in different events for rewards (wearables and emotes).\n\nThe team prioritizes the player’s experience in BPF, and we want to elevate the BPF experience further. Thus, we envisage the continuation of development in BPF, with many new and fresh mechanics that intertwine with existing features. Being a staple in Decentraland (DCL), BPF had more than 30000 unique visitors in the last 90 days and an average of more than 4000 weekly sessions for the last 8 months, and we strive to attract more visitors into DCL and represent DCL on an international scale.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n90,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x017fBaDCA2Dbc267Bb046624F23831662A6Fd718\n\n## Email address\n\nbutterflyprawnfarm@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe Butterfly Prawn Farm (BPF) is a F2P, P2E farm game that aims to create an easy-to-play Metaverse game in Decentraland (DCL) for the whole community. BPF's goal is to continuously boost and engage the community in DCL. With a delivered Minimum Viable Product (MVP), BPF aims to push the boundaries, building onto fresh and advanced features, catering to farmers (aka players) with months of mileage. Similarly, BPF continues to attract new farmers through the next phase of development (details in the Dropbox link).\n\nThis baseline game product currently allows the farmers to harvest crops, catch farm animals, perform crafting, ascend the Magic Beanstalk, and scout the Cloud Castle. Being one of the top P2E games in DCL, BPF also offers multiple activities and events with wearable/emote rewards. Furthermore, BPF has also been known to be setting standards on compliance, and introducing new and innovative wearable/emote utilities in DCL.\n\nCurrently, with high traction, the game quickly propelled seasoned/advanced farmers toward the end of the game. As a result, the team seeks to adhere to the level of dedication and motivation to continue developing advanced features for seasoned farmers. The team is also planning to develop new features to engage new farmers and provide seasoned farmers with more activities within the farm. With the drive to further BPF’s cause to the community and DCL, the team would like to seek funding from the community in this expansion plan. The team also strongly believes that the funding and support will value-add, boost, retain, and engage the community.\n\nThe team consists of 7 team members with a vast set of skills and experience. Our collaborative experiences include full-stack (frontend & backend) software development and deployment, product management, 2D/3D product design, and operations support.\n\nExperience aside, we are a group of game enthusiasts. Passionate and inspired by the Metaverse, we have been actively developing and deploying new features in BPF frequently while tapping into our expertise. We always aim to serve and attract the DCL community better, through one-of-a-kind events, gameplay, and wearables!\n\nOur team believes in delivering only the best for DCL community. As we tap into our expertise, the team applies agile development (SCRUM), where we have meetings (daily stand-up and fortnightly sprints) to be kept abreast of development progress, design updates, ideation, and retrospectives.\n\nCollaboration:\nApart from developing BPF, the team believes in doing what is best for the DCL community as well. Because of this, we actively foster collaboration and compliance. Below is a list of projects/community we collaborated and engaged in during the last grant.\n\n1.  Curation station library\n    2 Meta GamiMall\n2.  Meta Residence Tower\n3.  Decentraland Blog Post, written by Yurius, the product manager\n4.  Project management monthly meeting with video demonstration and metrics to the Grant Support Squad for compliance\n5.  Monthly reports for compliance\n\nDropbox Link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zmlz0a4pji2tmxm/AAA8nUzmPQvs6\\_uDn3SPd3hDa?dl=0\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nPhase 1:\n\n1, Cloud Castle Expansion\n2\\. New plots with new utility\n3\\. Plot logic and new materials\n4\\. Harvest and fertilizer logic\n\nPhase 2:\n\n1.  Animal farm (Rearing of farm animals with produce)\n2.  Development of animals (Design/logic)\n3.  Purchases and frontend design/logic\n4.  Backend design/logic\n5.  Produce and expiry logic\n6.  Passive effects\n\nOngoing development throughout 6 months:\n\n1.  Marketplace trading\n2.  Overall gameplay and server improvements\n3.  New wearables\n4.  3 events and rewards\n5.  Technical debts and bug fixes\n6.  Cybersecurity improvements\n\nSustainability\n\n1.  Selling of wearables and emotes on DCL Marketplace. Current sales amount to more than $MANA 7500. With a more aggressive approach for wearables and emotes sales, it would fund day-to-day operations. The team is mindful to balance ALL wearables and emotes in-game bonuses to continue to attract the secondary market, benefiting from BPF\n2.  Launch of rare/supply-controlled wearables (higher bonuses to games) - More mythic tier wearables to command competitive prices for sustainability\n3.  Sales of in-game currency in BPF Marketplace (in $MANA) - Purchase of BP Coins to purchase in-game commodities from shop/farmers\n4.  Collaboration - Working with other artists, DCL content providers to share costs on design, curator fees and advertising\n5.  Content pass - For farmers who paid for extra content (additional plots etc)\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xed0e0cb94f60f72ec94bef848f5df4cbd365af1d (DuelArena)\n\nShould the following $75,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/g59NHrl.jpg\n\n**Dear all, I am pleased to inform you that our proposal has been approved. However, we have encountered a slight setback as it was submitted under the wrong category. Therefore, we kindly request your attention once again as we re-submit our proposal. Thank You!**\n\nOur project is the development of an immersive 3D game for the Decentraland platform. Our goal is to provide players with a unique gaming experience that combines parkour, team games, and strategic battles. One of our key features is the ability to crossover game progress between our 2D and 3D, allowing players to seamlessly continue their gameplay experience regardless of which mode they choose.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n75,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xed0E0cb94F60F72ec94beF848f5dF4Cbd365aF1D\n\n## Email address\n\ninfo@duelarenap2e.com\n\n## Description\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nAs a team, we are excited to present our updated grant proposal for Duel Arena on Decentraland. We have taken the time to listen to the community's feedback and have worked hard to refine our 2D model while also developing the 3D version of the game.\n\nWe recently imported our game into WebGL, The community wanted the game to be directly accessible on DCL without a frame. As a result, we have made adjustments to our approach and have imported WebGL on a separate page but are working on a 3D game mode in DCL aswell.\n\nWe have also implemented a data storage system using PlayFab that enables players to make progress in either the 2D or 3D game, and it will carry over to the other platform. We believe that this feature will be a significant asset to the game and add value to the player experience.\n\nWe have a webpage for our proposal active for this proposal and will share a document with fundamentals.\n\nhttps://www.duelarenap2e.com/grant-proposal\n\n**Contributing to Decentraland's Growth:**\n\nAdditionally, we aim to contribute to the growth and success of the Decentraland platform. Our game will bring increased engagement and activity to the platform, and our data storage and crossover system will set a new standard for games on the platform.\n\n**Experienced Team:**\n\nOur team has the necessary skills and experience to make Duel Arena a success, and we are committed to creating a high-quality game that will meet the needs and expectations of the Decentraland community. We believe that our project deserves funding because of its unique features, potential benefits, and alignment with the vision and mission of the Decentraland platform.\n\n**Progress Made:**\n\nWhile we have made significant progress in the development of Duel Arena for the Decentraland platform, it's important to note that the 3D game is not yet finished. However, we have created a 2D game that is currently live and playable on itch.io. We have designed the 2D game to serve as a demo for the 3D game and showcase some of the features and content that we plan to include.\n\n**Battleground Map:**\n\nDespite the 3D game being a work in progress, we have made significant strides in its development, as outlined in the previous section. Our team is confident in our ability to complete the development of Duel Arena and deliver a high-quality game that will meet the needs and expectations of the Decentraland community. We have also developed a unique battleground map that is set on a floating platform above the 3D game map.\n\n**Functional Buttons and Wearables:**\n\nFurthermore, we have created several UI buttons such as Play 2D, Home, and Play Now. We have also developed functional buttons for gathering resources, including wood, fire, dandelions, and water. Winning battles will give players game currency that can be used to purchase wearable NFTs that give bonuses in-game.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOur team has made significant progress in the development of Duel Arena and is committed to creating a high-quality game that will meet the needs and expectations of the Decentraland community. We believe that our game has the potential to contribute to the growth and success of the platform, and we are excited to continue our work on this project.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/0i6oZgi\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Progress So Far**\n\n*   We released the stress test 2D version of our game in February 2023.\n\n*   We launched our fandom page on February in 2023.\n\n*   We submitted our first grant proposal, March in 2023.\n\n*   We created a 3D Map of the game and used the 2D one as a reference in March 2023.\n\n*   We started to host our 2D game through WebGL in March 2023.\n\n*   We added a full UI template on the 3D scene in March 2023.

    "title": "How to trigger DCL’s Growth by boosting virtual psycho-social Interactions",
    "body": "> by 0x4df61fb35629c58088cdd4451276097c7754e13e (Hypatia)\n\nShould the following $12,000 grant in the Documentation category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAs part of this community, our team wishes to assist DCL in reaching its highest potential.\nFor more than a decade, we have studied the links between humans and virtual space as a new possible habitat.\n\nOur experience shows that in order to trigger DCL’s growth we must focus on the current state of users’ psycho-social interactions at the virtual common space.\n\nThe aims of our work are: (1) to address problematic dimensions that remain veiled, (2) so that we can offer perspectives and concrete solutions to encourage social interaction and enrich the potential of empathy. These are key points for DCL’s future.\n\nThe resulting report shall be directed to users, people involved in decision-making within the platform and public in general.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n12,000 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4dF61fb35629C58088cDd4451276097c7754e13E\n\n## Email address\n\nanima.metaverse@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nHuman creativity together with technological updates were capable of creating such groundbreaking spaces that, on the one hand, came as wonderful, and on the other hand, produced certain unrest in their new inhabitants. The virtual space of DCL is one of these special creations, and for this reason we perceive it wonderful but also challenging.\n\nAs animals, humans are adaptive beings and they are not precisely used to living in a space that augments discomfort, fears and concerns. These prejudice the development of human capacities and of socio-productive environments.\nThe feeling of unrest can grow when, for example as in DCL, the management of the environment is not centrally controlled, for which there is a lot more uncertainty around the directions that this space can take. This can be perceived not only in many critics but also in potential users.\nNevertheless, the fact of DCL’s management being precisely decentralized and its immense future civilizational projection is exactly what puts us together to work.\n\nThis is why we look forward to offering new perspectives and tools to unveil the new configurations of the psycho-social relationships and understand more deeply the virtual spaces where these take place. We consider this to be of huge importance in order to harmonize the ways of living and interacting in DCL and to harvest the social and productive potential wealth of this virtual environment that surrounds its users.\nGetting to identify and work on these issues will unlock new levels of interaction inside DCL. This may help its sociability and productivity, which is (for now) only partially achieved.\n\nEven though the DCL Community may conceive similar interests and operate in that direction, we believe that our constancy as well as our practical and theoretical experience as professional researchers will more quickly obtain accurate, visible and long-lasting results. The philosophical and socio-cultural document that we offer will organize, deepen and show practical solutions.\n\nOur experience indicates that if we are seeking for a more empathic space at DCL and a wider access rate we need undoubtedly to identify the problematic and invisibilized dimensions that hold back the users from: creating more interesting content; sharing higher-quality proposals; and developing committed, diverse and enriching ways of interaction.\nHistory shows that empathy and cooperation allowed communities of all times to outmaneuver their competitors in many ways. We hope that our report collaborates in this direction and enables a significant growth in terms of quality and quantity in all aspects of DCL.\n\nSpecifically, our report will intertwine studies, analysis, reflections and conclusions all directed to solve problematics related to the following issues:\n\\-DCL and civilizational projects in the 21st Century\n\\-New societies, communities and individualities in virtual times\n\\-Exploration and acknowledgement of collective and individual virtual identities\n\\-Psycho-social relationships in the virtual spaces: types of sociability and psychological dimensions\n\\-Cooperation and empathy for fruitful environments\n\\-Roles, commitments, responsibilities and benefits\n\\-Social and productive interactivity\n\\-Community and economy in empathic and competitive societies\n\nFinally, we will make a brief presentation with the ideas that appear to solve the detected and analyzed problems so that our work enables a transparent and successful path for the growth of DCL.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur work will be accomplished in 6 stages:\n\nI. Opening analysis\n\\-Identify psycho-social keys of the virtual interactions at DCL\n\\-Detect the issues linked to sociability and productivity that depend on the keys previously identified.\n\nII. Practical and theoretical bonding\n\\-Analyze bibliographical and audiovisual material (both academic and other kind of specialized material)\n\\-Apply theories and concepts to the issues and key points detected\n\\-Address the background of the current psycho-social panorama\n\nIII. Initial structure and analytic insight\n\\-Organize and deepen the analysis following an integral perspective\n\\-Elaborate a framework for comprehension of the most relevant problematics\n\nIV. Advanced problematization and reflection\n\\-Project DCL in the current technological global moment\n\\-Detail positive and negative aspects of the analysis\n\\-Ponder the socio-productive relevance of the different aspects considered\n\nV. Fundamental elements and counterposition\n\\-Apply the theoretical background according to the experienced in the platform\n\\-Project the dynamic of the DCL psycho-social relationships\n\\-Compare alternatives to solve the problematics identified\n\nVI. Final elaboration\n\\-Choose the best alternatives to develop the main aspects\n\\-Prepare, write and edit the report for its presentation/publishing\n\nThe results of this research are thought to be contained in a large-scope report that may be splitted and published and/or presented in official formats (journals and events).\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Purchase of LAND in Genesis City",
    "body": "> by 0x8218a2445679e38f358e42f88fe2125c98440d59 (1010)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Purchase of LAND in Genesis City](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b4478e00-dd94-11ed-93f4-8f8fa30ce0cd)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis governance proposal is to advance the purchase of LAND in Genesis City.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\n4 polls were conducted to determine 3 key objectives:\n\n1.  Whether the community agrees to buy LAND in Genesis City.\n    The community voted 'YES' (95%)\n\nRefer to Annex (1)\n\n2.  Whether to buy the cheapest on Marketplace, or to create a price formula.\n    The community voted 'Buy cheapest at marketplace' (61%)\n\nRefer to Annex (1)\n\n3.  The parameters for purchasing LAND.\n    The community voted to purchase LANDs that are 4k MANA and below(70%), at a monthly spending cap of 40k MANA or less(67%), and to give contiguous LANDS/ESTATE priority(76%)\n\nRefer to Annex (2-4)\n\nThe recently concluded draft proposal has reaffirmed the support(80%) to move this into governance action.\n\nRefer to Linked Draft Proposal (above)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO has been having ongoing discussions as to whether LAND should be purchased and repurposed for the past year, in order to provide valuable content as opposed to LANDs being left barren and used purely as a speculative instrument.\nIt is after numerous discussions that the community has decided it is best to purchase LANDs for purposes that will be agreed upon at a later date.\n\nThis bear market has also brought about a unique opportunity in which LAND value has reached fair to under valuation, and it is prudent for the DAO to make purchases of LANDs/ESTATEs now rather than during a bull market where valuations can go beyond what is deemed reasonable for purchase.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe monthly purchase process of LAND/ESTATE has to fulfil 5 criterias.\n\n1.  Adhere to a price ceiling of 4k MANA per parcel\n\nAnnex (2)\n\n2.  Adhere to a maximum monthly budget of 40k MANA.\n\nAnnex(3)\n\n3.  LANDs which are contiguous and priced at or near floor(a leeway of +10% above floor price during the time of purchase) will be given priority. Only LANDs/ESTATEs which are evenly shaped(1x2, 1x3..., 2x2, 2x3.., 3x3, 3x4.. and so forth) will be considered. If no such LANDs/ESTATE exists during the time of purchase, LANDs at floor price shall be purchased.\n\nAnnex (1) and (4)\n\n4.  Purchase is to be made at the end of each month, at any point in the day(GMT), at the discretion of the DAO Committee.\n\n5.  All purchases are to only be made with MANA. Purchases can be made on both Opensea as well as the Decentraland Marketplace.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\n1.  The vesting contract releases approximately 1.7m MANA per month. Therefore, the expenditure of 40k MANA per month represents approximately 2.5% of MANA that is released.\n    https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac\n\n2.  LANDs that are acquired can be repurposed to fit the needs of the DAO, or be rented out, adding another potential source of revenue stream.\n\n3.  The balance sheet of the DAO will include, among other financial assets, LAND, leading to a diversification of the treasury.\n\n4.  Floor price of LANDs may be supported in the short term. In the longer term, whilst the DAO may act as a quasi-market maker, the impact is not expected to be huge. For reference, the average monthly volume from the past 6 months (October 2022 to March 2023) in FIAT terms is $320k USD. At today’s price of $0.55USD/MANA, the 40k MANA per month cap will represent 7% of the volume.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n1.  The DAO Committee will have autonomy to decide as to whether they prefer to work with the dApps team to create a smart contract which follows specifications, or to execute the purchase manually.\n\n2.  Include LANDs as part of the DAO's treasury assets on the transparency dashboard and all related documents.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn light of Genesis City LANDs/ESTATEs being underutilised and the floor price reaching an \"undervalued/fairly valued\" valuation, The DAO has come to a decision based on discussions and finally a poll, to purchase LANDs/ESTATEs for repurposing.\n\nThe purchase agreement will follow parameters that have been agreed upon by the community to ensure prudence in expenditure.\n\nThe purchase and ownership of LAND/ESTATEs will expand the DAO capabilities in 5 ways, primarily:\n\n1.  To organise events/activities such as town halls etc.\n2.  Generate passive income to the DAO by rentals.\n3.  Provide LAND to grantees who require space to deploy.\n4.  Allow the DAO to create scenes all over Genesis City that may lead to a better experience for users, such as kiosks that may provide ‘ATM’ services etc.\n5.  Possibly used as rewards/prizes for any events organised by the DAO.\n\nAnnex (1) - Should the DAO Buy Back LAND?\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e62c2260-bdd1-11ed-8c13-518b5c1940be\n\nAnnex (2) - the ceiling price PER PARCEL allowed by the DAO to purchase from the marketplace.\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c66846e0-d9a4-11ed-bfff-7567e61aeee0\n\nAnnex (3) - The total amount of MANA that the DAO is allowed to spend MONTHLY on purchasing LAND.\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=cd5e1640-d9a5-11ed-bfff-7567e61aeee0\n\nAnnex (4) - Whether contiguous LANDs should be given priority.\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=47f1c960-d9a6-11ed-bfff-7567e61aeee0\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Formal Pathway for DAO Request for Information (RFI) from the Foundation",
    "body": "> by 0x5b5cc427c1d81db4f94de4d51d85ce122d63e244 (Fehz)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Formal Pathway for DAO Request for Information (RFI) from the Decentraland Foundation](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=57d7a630-be38-11ed-8c13-518b5c1940be)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal outlines a process to implement a formal pathway for the DAO to issue a “request for information” (RFI) from the Decentraland Foundation.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Request for Information (RFI) process for the Decentraland DAO and the Decentraland Foundation has been designed for addressing the asymmetry in context, resources, and contributions between the Foundation and the community. The RFI process would enable the DAO to issue requests for information to the Foundation on any of the defined categories of interest, which would require a formal statement of response from the Foundation. While the response would be non-binding, this process would allow the DAO to communicate its interests and alleviate information asymmetry.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nDecentraland is a progressively decentralizing ecosystem, managed by two core stakeholders: the Decentraland DAO and the Decentraland Foundation. While both of these entities are themselves made up of a diverse and multi-interested group of stakeholders, a cooperative and structured institutional relationship between the DAO and the Foundation is beneficial, if not necessary to the success of our metaversal “way of life.”\n\nThe most important proposal to date outlining a formal relationship between the DAO and the Foundation was recently passed as a Binding Governance Proposal, delegating responsibility for determining and implementing the “reference client roadmap” to the Decentraland Foundation.”\n\nIn the reference client proposal, the Decentraland Foundation notes the following key point: “The project is currently in a state of asymmetry in terms of context/resources/contributions between the Foundation and the community.”\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal aims to establish a pathway for the DAO to issue a “Request for Information” (RFI) from the Decentraland Foundation via the DAO’s governance dApp and/or other complementary tools. A DAO RFI can be on any topic of interest or concern, and if passed, will require a formal statement of response from the Decentraland Foundation. While any response to an RFI will be non-binding, this is an important mechanism for the DAO to communicate its interests and alleviate information “asymmetry” between the Foundation and the Community.\n\n1.  **General Guidelines**: An RFI can be useful when there is necessary information which you do not currently have access to. An RFI can be about the “what”, “why” and/or “how” of a specific topic. It is highly recommended to limit the request and to be specific about what information is being requested in order to optimize the document for brevity, as this will allow Foundation to read and digest the information in less time without omitting key information.\n2.  **Liaison (DAO-Foundation)**: - DAO Facilitation Squad will serve as an Entries & Support Desk (ESD) to organize, prioritize, forward the questionnaires, and reach out to the Foundation technical areas. Meaning that the ESD will be responsible for managing a pipeline for all RFI, help with their writing and for verifying the feasibility of getting answers.\n3.  **Channel & Functioning**:\n\n    3.1. The main channel for submitting RFIs and getting responses will be a Category created on the Forum for setting up the ESD.\n\n    3.2. Each thread created within the RFI Category will remain open for a continuous period of 14 days for community members to submit their questions through the template form (ANNEX A). The ESD Facilitator will moderate these threads and will possess the authority to remove posts that are not relevant to the RFI form.\n\n    3.3. The questions submitted by the community will be ranked based on the number of votes/likes received within a period of 14 days after the first stage is closed. This ranking will determine the priority of the questions/topics for the community, and the questions with the most votes/likes will be forwarded to the Foundation.\n\n    3.4. Once the current round of submissions is complete, another round will be opened to allow community members to pose their questions.\n\n    3.5. The process must allow sufficient time for responses and provide an appropriate deadline for the Decentraland Foundation to respond to the RFIs. As a standard, the Foundation will have a 20 working days period to send a response, considering the necessary time to gather and compile all relevant information and documentation.\n\n    3.6. Time Extensions: If the Foundation considers that the posed questions are complex or require extensive research or analysis, will be able to ask for a time extension.\n\n    3.7. Publishing: The response will be public and available for everyone through official channels such as the Governance dApp, social media, and/or other communication channels and complementary apps.\n\n    3.8. Follow ups: The requestant may, if necessary, seek additional clarification or information on specific topics or questions from the Decentraland Foundation by submitting another RFI form and referencing the previous Q\\&A. This option will be available for the period of 5 days after the corresponding RFI was responded. After that period, the requestant will be required to initiate a new RFI process.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed RFI process aims to establish a cooperative and structured institutional relationship between the DAO and the Foundation, benefiting the success of Decentraland's metaverse. The process will enable the DAO to communicate its interests, alleviate information asymmetry, and allow the Foundation to respond to community concerns and suggestions in a transparent and accountable manner.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x56469159d91eb810dce34dd13ec4ed8194bca7be (NikkiFuego)\n\nFor the past several months, Polygon GWEI has been out of control. Currently, the threshold for \"free\" gas to the consumer is 150 GWEI. Meaning that anytime GWEI is higher than 150, services like the Marketplace: wearable purchases and wearable transfers, Builder: Minting, adding minters, adding collaborators, putting on sale, and L2 services: MANA transfer, L2 wearable drop, etc will fail, and force consumers to swap to Polygon to pay the gas themselves. However, switching to polygon and paying gas is not an option for in-world meta-transactions. Those just outright fail.\n\nCurrently, the DAO covers these gas costs and the average is $1k-$2k USD worth of Matic spent each month on Polygon GWEI (data provided by HP). This poll is to increase the threshold from 150 to 300 to meet the new standard norm that we've been experiencing for the last few months.\n\n- Yes, increase GWEI threshold to 300\n- No, leave GWEI threshold at 150\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Growth and Maintenance of Decentraland Brazil Community \"DCL_Brasil\"",
    "body": "> by 0x3429cbff7eb34e4c9dd9d7e41041fd7b2a01fdb0 (Atrovenado)\n\nShould the following $38,700 grant in the Documentation category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nOur focus is to keep the onboarding and marketing focused on Decentraland, offering users precise explanations, translations of all tools, updates, and platform functionalities, as well as training and humanized support. In this way, we seek to promote growth and create opportunities for all platform users, facilitating access and encouraging the creation of new communities in other countries. Our goal is to make the platform inclusive and accessible through education and encouraging translation.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n38,700 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x3429CbFf7EB34e4C9dD9D7E41041fd7b2a01FdB0\n\n## Email address\n\natrovenado@decentralandbrasil.com\n\n## Description\n\nIn this concession proposal, the Decentraland Brazil community team, also known as \"DCL Brasil,\" requests support to ensure the continuity and improvement of inclusion projects, training with humanized support, and essential maintenance of the community. For more than a year, we have been committed to publicizing and expanding the platform in the country. During this period, our team and projects were financed exclusively with funds from the Founder's personal budget, without ever resorting to any funds from the DAO.\nSince the beginning, our main objective has been to educate and generate opportunities for all. We seek to attract new users, brands, and creators to Web3 to foster the growth and expansion of the platform. We support and launch new community talent, offering resources and guidance to help them achieve their creative goals. In addition, we encourage training for new creators, SDKs, and modelers, creating help groups where more experienced individuals offer support and guidance to beginners, sharing their knowledge and skills to help others grow and develop.\n\nAs the community grows and evolves, new talent is discovered and supported in their creative journeys. Through carefully planned actions and opportunities, the community is turning dreams into reality and cultivating a vibrant culture of creativity and innovation. Because we believe that everyone has unique skills and talents that deserve to be valued and supported, we work to promote actions that generate personalized opportunities for each individual, according to their skills and interests.\nDuring this period, the team's salary and the community's projects were financed solely by the Founder's personal budget. Some initiatives were taken, such as the purchase of land that today houses the headquarters of DCL Brazil, whose coordinates are (-107, -94). In addition, a community T-shirt was published, with free distribution to all members and interested parties. Twelve wearables were also created in collaboration with other members of the platform. We also acquired seven Decentraland names.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe believe that creative success is most achievable when we work together as a community. Therefore, we are committed to building a support network that values collaboration and the sharing of ideas. Together, we are creating a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone can develop their creative talents and reach their full potential. We distributed \"more than 4,000 T-shirts\" highlighting the number of people who got involved in a certain action or initiative. T-shirt distribution is a mass mobilization to achieve a common goal, such as promoting a specific event or cause, creating and promoting visual identity, and a sense of unity among participants, further increasing community engagement on the platform.\nWe carry out several actions with companies and educational institutions from different segments, such as:\n\n*   Metasafe: Technology and Law\n    METÁFASE of Technology and Law, a multidisciplinary team, formed by specialists in the legal area and technology, that helps companies to stay safe\n    https://www.instagram.com/p/ChpsO7ppCDx/\n    Universidade Metodista de São Paulo\n    Instituto Educ 360°: Institution of Higher and Corporate Education.\n    https://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=58747ac4-85eb-4ab5-8454-9ed4636847e6\n    ANPPD: National Association of Data Privacy Professionals\n\nFull Length Proposal (posting here due to grant proposal character limitations) - LINK\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1ezulF2ulYT7wbFrBNzda81yNFFDuQ8n4KPmr-KlS06Y/edit?usp=sharing\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

After 19 months of hard work, we have proven that our project can effectively attract high quality brands to Decentraland, and generates relatively large & sustainable traffic.\n\nSo next, we want to ask for DCL DAO grant support to continue our project and expand it.\n\n**Notice: This is the 2nd submission of the proposal, we made some adjustments based on the current project status and market condition.**\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n55,400 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xB982A614f11Fa347B44a046B3e5F533CBCF105c8\n\n## Email address\n\nmetalivestudio@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n**Since we introduced our project in a very informative way in our last grant proposal, we learned that not everyone wants to read the long description like we did last time. So this time, we will just short brief the bullet points here, for those who want to check our last proposal, please refer to this link:**\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=33ef4090-7fb1-11ed-8a61-75966587ad4f\n\n**What we are?**\n\nVideo Introduction: https://vimeo.com/817200293?share=copy\n\nMeta GamiMall is a Metaverse mall that aims to become the bridge between players and brands and gather them here in Decentraland. We provide rich experiences from multiple mini-games to the music stages, and we insert advertising in those experiences to make sure that the brands get exposure. You will see various forms of brand advertisements here, some are logos, some direct players to their Twitter or Discord, and some are 3d models of Brands' products. And in return, brands will provide attractive but limited wearables or NFTs as rewards, and players need to collect enough materials in games to claim the rewards, in this process, they will also notice Brands' advertisements which is how we bring awareness to brands.\n\n**Requested budget cut down?**\n\nFrom 60k to 55k\n\n**What brands have we already onboarded to Decentraland? What DCL Community Brands also participated in our event?**\n\nOutside brands: Coca-Cola, Meama Coffee, Sensorium, Galxe, Haskkey Dx, CryptoSlot CreatorDAO, MUA, MetaCat, MetaPoly, Polybasic, SalvikFarm, Adshare, TraditionNow\n\nDCl community brands: Decentral Games, MetaViu, WildernessP2E, Knights of Antrom, Soul Magic, BP Farm, Polygonal Mind Golfcraft, Voxboard, Waifumon, Vroomway\n\n**How is our traffic?** (Based on PlayFab and DCL metrics data)\n\n*   Recorded around 9000 unique users in our database\n*   An average of 230+ daily active users for a half year.\n*   Most of the time, our concurrent users rank top 2-5 among all Decentraland projects.\n*   Recently, we saw a maximum of 120 concurrent users due to the MetaMine Season 2.\n*   Super high average spent time - 6 hrs 23 mins\n\n**Why do we need this grant?**\n\nTo support our daily expanse  on keep onboarding brands, maintaining and expanding our traffic, and developing a unified scene to help other DCL community projects create and maintain traffic\n\n**Economic Sustainbility**\n\nOur project is one of the most promising projects that have the potential of being economically sustainable due to our clear business model, to put it in a simple way,  we receive sponsorship from brands like Coca-Cola to join our event. Thus, it is very possible that we can be able to run sustainably in the long term future. We will aim to ask for fewer grants in future, however, this will depend on the macro market, what value can we contribute to the prosperity of Decentraland and the efforts that we spent.\n\n**Is our project open-source?**\n\nYes, here is the link（keep updating） https://github.com/MetaLiveStudio/MetaGamiMall_GA\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nAs we mentioned in the beginning, we have already hit some of the roadmaps that we proposed in our last proposal even without further grants. Here is the new roadmap:\n\nMonth 1\n\nDevelop a coin cap system to put a cap on how many coins can a user get daily.\n\nDevelop a resource exchange to help players to exchange coins and other materials\n\nUser experience improvements and bug fixing\n\nMonth 2\n\nDevelop a unified scene with coins to extend our game out of our current lands, and let anyone who has land to be able to deploy it\n\nBusiness development and start to onboard new brands to MetaMine Season 3\n\nUser experience improvements and bug fixing\n\nMonth 3\n\nExperimenting with the unified scene with our partners, and testing the effects.\n\nBusiness development and start to onboard new brands to MetaMine Season 3 and create wearables and advertising content for them\n\nUser experience improvements and bug fixing\n\nMonth 4\n\nDeploy the unified scene with coins to more than 5 parcels in at least 5 different locations.\n\nBusiness development and start to onboard new brands to MetaMine Season 3 and create wearables and advertising content for them\n\nUser experience improvements and bug fixing\n\nMonth 5\n\nMonth-long large event MetaMine Season 3\n\nUser experience improvements and bug fixing\n\nMonth 6\n\nDeploy more of the unified scene and create some customization for some projects.\n\nMigrate to SDK 7\n\nUser experience improvements and bug fixing\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Developer Support Bot Trained On Decentraland Documents",
    "body": "> by 0xce6bf74d6b9d998e5f44364899dabe3cb3ba8497\n\nShould the following $5,000 grant in the Documentation category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe propose to build a Discord bot for the Decentraland developer community that will use the latest technology around LLM’s (Large Language Models) to import Decentraland's Github repos, documentation, Slack and Discord Q\\&A’s to provide an interface for Decentraland developers and users to ask questions in natural language.\n\nOur goal is to provide another member to Decentraland's DevRel team, reducing support hours on Discord and Slack and a path of triage for commonly asked questions (making the team and users get answers quicker).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n1 month\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xc5F1C802F56e34B05e9aAfBFE0302c6595405035\n\n## Email address\n\nali@trytali.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe core of technical Web3 projects depends on a healthy ecosystem of developers using the protocols. Developers learn how to use the various projects through inspecting developer docs and Github repositories. As expected, documentation doesn’t cover everything and a team of people are needed to provide “front line” support to those building/using the protocol.\n\nEnter Developer Relations, a team tasked with being the first human interface with protocols who provide 2 critical roles for the project: building developer communities & tracking product-market fit.\n\nThe issue that often arises is a lack of human capital to be able to deal with the number of requests & questions that populate a DevRel team's day.\n\nWe propose to provide a solution that will enable the Decentraland DevRel team to be able to focus on what they do best: solving unique customer problems and building trust in the protocol. By providing a bot that can answer previously asked questions, it will enable DevRel to become more effective and in turn provide higher quality support to end users.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe will use the funds to cover our development time (four weeks) and hosting for the bot for 6 months.\n\nProject Plan:\nPre-Implementation: We’d like to work with the DevRel team to understand their needs, sticking points, and time sinks to see where the bot can be of most assistance. We’ll use these insights to see which data sources need to be implemented.\n\nMilestone 1: Implementation of Data Sources \\[2 weeks]: Once discovery has been done, we’ll spend the time implementing the 3-4 most high-value data sources to Tali. We will leverage Llama Index to create indexes and a vector database to enable embeddings based search on queries. Optimization around how files are loaded, index creation, and integrating various data sources will need to be tested.\n\nEnd state: Have 3-4 data sources that can be queried on. Expected bugs: hallucinations, mismatch on query/documents.\n\nMilestone 2: Testing + Optimization \\[2 weeks]: Arguably the most important part of the process. The focus will be to discard hallucinations and optimize prompt engineering so only relevant answers appear, ideally with source material & links for the user to follow up on. The purpose of this will be to make the bot production ready.\n\nEnd state: Production-ready bot ready (once signed off on by DevRel team) to be deployed to Decentraland Discord and or Slack.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

[Coordinates 11,1](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=11%2C1\\&server=unicorn)\n\n### When:\n\nMonday 24.04.2023 19:00 UTC\n\n### Who:\n\nMy name is [crowdpunk](https://twitter.com/crowd_punk)\nand my purpose is to bring the long needed crowd to web3.  Everyone that cares and wants to be part of a historic moment is invited.\n\n### Why:\n\nDecentraland was created to meet and play in the cyber space. Let’s do exactly that and have fun and create history at the same time.\n\nThe following is a narrative from the future and you can chose to believe it, foster it and make it successful. This will show if the Decentraland community is dead, or can actually show face at their own party.  Showing up is all that is needed.\n\n### Prolog\n\nThe idea had been to challenge and break records in Decentraland.\nHow many users have been in Decentraland at any given point in time?\nHow many users all together at the same time, and how many in one specific location?\nSeemingly simple questions, but after researching and being in touch with the few data analytics projects in the space such as https://www.atlascorp.io/ the news was: We don’t know! No data recording or detailed analytics are available for around that time in 2021 when there was some movement. The best I got was some guesstimates of 2000+ users at the max in late 2021.\n\n### Pivot\n\nWhen you don’t know the record you just establish one! This proposal serves only this one purpose. To bring the most people Decentraland at the same time EVER. What does a cyber crowd feel like?\nCalling on all date scientist to pay attention and record this event to be able to analyze after.\n\n### Narrative\n\nEveryone that cares about Decentraland, and wants to experience what happens if there is actually users, will show up on [Monday 24.04.2023 19:00 UTC at Main Plaza](https://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=bd2f2af1-d650-40ca-8840-fa7232747d1b)\n\n[Decentraland. Coordinates 11,1](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=11%2C1\\&server=unicorn)\n\nWe will collectively walk around the Main Plaza one time and show face and interact with each other. I invite you to find me and send an in-world friend request. Only this first time  will I accept all requests. Befriend as many others as you can.\nFollowing media outlets will be informed about this proposal and the Parade. To help the cause you can also email them to make us heard.\n\nCointelegraph\neditor@cointelegraph.com\nopinion@cointelegraph.com\n\nCoindesk\ncasey@coindesk.com\ndesk@coindesk.com\n\nBeincrypto\nhttps://beincrypto.com/contact/\n\nDecrypt\neditor@decrypt.co\n\nCrypto Daily\nhello@cryptodaily.co.uk\n\n### Climax\n\nWe are establishing following records:\n\n1.  The most users to ever be in Decentraland at the same time.\n2.  The most users to ever be in one location in Decentraland at the same time.\n3.  The longest parade ever to be done in any virtual World ever.\n\n### Epilog:\n\nShould this be considered a spam proposal, take a deep breath, look at yourself and reflect on what you have actively taken action on to make Decentraland gain traction?\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/crowd_punk)\nto get updates\n\n[Event link](https://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=bd2f2af1-d650-40ca-8840-fa7232747d1b)\n\nIf you don’t show up to your own party, no one else will. This initiative will show if Decentraland is live or dead.\n\nVote YES if you will show up and want this to happen, and be proactive by emailing the media outlets to inform.\n\n- YES,  I will come\n- NO, we all go home\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Purchase of LAND in Genesis City",
    "body": "> by 0x8218a2445679e38f358e42f88fe2125c98440d59 (1010)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should the DAO Buy Back LAND?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e62c2260-bdd1-11ed-8c13-518b5c1940be)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis draft proposal is to advance the purchase of LAND in Genesis City.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\n4 polls were conducted to determine 3 key objectives:\n\n1.  Whether the community agrees to buy LAND in Genesis City.\n    The community voted 'YES' (95%)\n\nRefer to Annex (1)\n\n2.  Whether to buy the cheapest on Marketplace, or to create a price formula.\n    The community voted 'Buy cheapest at marketplace' (61%)\n\nRefer to Annex (1)\n\n3.  The parameters for purchasing LAND.\n    The community voted to purchase LANDs that are 4k MANA and below(70%), at a monthly spending cap of 40k MANA or less(67%), and to give contiguous LANDS/ESTATE priority(76%)\n\nRefer to Annex (2-4)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO has been having ongoing discussions as to whether LAND should be purchased and repurposed for the past year, in order to provide valuable content as opposed to LANDs being left barren and used purely as a speculative instrument.\nIt is after numerous discussions that the community has decided it is best to purchase LANDs for purposes that will be agreed upon at a later date.\n\nThis bear market has also brought about a unique opportunity in which LAND value has reached fair to under valuation, and it is prudent for the DAO to make purchases of LANDs/ESTATEs now rather than during a bull market where valuations can go beyond what is deemed reasonable for purchase.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe monthly purchase process of LAND/ESTATE has to fulfil 5 criterias.\n\n1.  Adhere to a price ceiling of 4k MANA per parcel\n\nAnnex (2)\n\n2.  Adhere to a maximum monthly budget of 40k MANA.\n\nAnnex(3)\n\n3.  LANDs which are contiguous and priced at or near floor(a leeway of +10% above floor price during the time of purchase) will be given priority. Only LANDs/ESTATEs which are evenly shaped(1x2, 1x3..., 2x2, 2x3.., 3x3, 3x4.. and so forth) will be considered. If no such LANDs/ESTATE exists during the time of purchase, LANDs at floor price shall be purchased.\n\nAnnex (1) and (4)\n\n4.  Purchase is to be made at the end of each month, at any point in the day(GMT), at the discretion of the DAO Committee.\n\n5.  All purchases are to only be made with MANA. Purchases can be made on both Opensea as well as the Decentraland Marketplace.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn light of Genesis City LANDs/ESTATEs being underutilised and the floor price reaching an \"undervalued/fairly valued\" valuation, The DAO has come to a decision based on discussions and finally a poll, to purchase LANDs/ESTATEs for repurposing.\n\nThe purchase agreement will follow parameters that have been agreed upon by the community to ensure prudence in expenditure.\n\nThe purchase and ownership of LAND/ESTATEs will expand the DAO capabilities in 5 ways, primarily:\n\n1.  To organise events/activities such as town halls etc.\n2.  Generate passive income to the DAO by rentals.\n3.  Provide LAND to grantees who require space to deploy.\n4.  Allow the DAO to create scenes all over Genesis City that may lead to a better experience for users, such as kiosks that may provide ‘ATM’ services etc.\n5.  Possibly used as rewards/prizes for any events organised by the DAO.\n\nAnnex (1) - Should the DAO Buy Back LAND?\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e62c2260-bdd1-11ed-8c13-518b5c1940be\n\nAnnex (2) - the ceiling price PER PARCEL allowed by the DAO to purchase from the marketplace.\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c66846e0-d9a4-11ed-bfff-7567e61aeee0\n\nAnnex (3) - The total amount of MANA that the DAO is allowed to spend MONTHLY on purchasing LAND.\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=cd5e1640-d9a5-11ed-bfff-7567e61aeee0\n\nAnnex (4) - Whether contiguous LANDs should be given priority.\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=47f1c960-d9a6-11ed-bfff-7567e61aeee0\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Create personalized AI NPCs to expand Decentland's metaverse ecosystem",
    "body": "> by 0x80c0ac9c0ea90b6d464854e478331320e4a3bb32 (banyu)\n\nShould the following $85,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe will add AI NPCs to Decentraland to bring a more interesting experience to the game and provide more diverse elements to the metaverse. They can simulate human behavior and dialogue, generate personalized action plans and conversations, and each NPC is unique and assigned connections. We plan to enable these AI NPCs to affect each other's relationship values in the final stage, and players can observe or influence the NPCs' social relationships.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n85,000 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x0FFf31581A95F2926ae656db886229c9B053ee2E\n\n## Email address\n\nblockerchain519@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nWith the outbreak of AIGC, our team, as early participants in Decentraland, realized that AI + Decentraland would be very cool. This year, we began to explore how to build intelligent Decentraland elements. Originally, we planned to create browser components embedded in the 3D model of Decentraland, allowing players to search for metaverse strategies without having to leave the current immersive scene. However, during the development process, we found that AI NPCs would be more likely to expand the ecosystem of Decentraland.\n\nOnce these NPCs have their own story background and form their own personalities, and even generate relationships between these intelligent NPCs, the scene will be very interesting. We hope that this IDear can be realized in Decentraland.\n\nAs Decentraland serves as a carrier for the metaverse, AI NPCs can play various roles in Decentraland and can respond to different situations and player behaviors in different ways, generating personalized dialogues and action plans.\n\nFor example:\n\n*   In a tavern, a chatty bartender can be found. When chatting with him, he will constantly talk about what he has done today.\n*   In a painting studio, an artist who only knows how to draw circles may become panicked when asked to draw squares. You need to calm the artist down through suitable conversations.\n\nThis intelligent game element can bring more interesting experiences to players, thus attracting more users.\n\nAt the same time, in order to achieve sustainable application and integrate with other landowners' fields, we have designed a reasonable development route with phases. Each adorable AI NPC born is actually like Decentraland welcoming a new resident, they have their own birthdate and sign, they have their own favorite food and NPCs, as well as dislikes. The only similarity is that these adorable NPCs always stand firmly on their posts and hope to gain the player's love after completing their work.\n\nIn our plans, AI NPCs can not only be applied in the above-mentioned scenarios, but we will also operate these AI NPCs.\n\nFor example:\n\n*   Establish dedicated social media accounts to create a popular internet personality IP, a AI NPC with human fans is also a very interesting scenario.\n*   And by organizing some activities around these AI NPCs in Decentraland, it can lengthen the brand effect of Decentraland.\n\nOur work in addition to implementing development, we also have specific marketing plans, after all, marketing is a long-term process. In order to attract attention, we will seek cooperation with KOL and media in the early stage, and let them promote and advertise Decentraland. In the middle stage, it can be adjusted according to the situation, such as promoting through various channels such as social media, email, advertising. In the late stage, it can be more focused on user experience and interaction, by enhancing user loyalty through interactive experiences with AI NPCs.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nOur roadmap is divided into four phases, each with different goals, and our roadmap also contains achievable commercial use cases with a planned period of six months.\n\n*   The first stage belongs to experimental and testing on a single field.\n    *   The experimental scene of the first field will be designed.\n    *   AI NPCs will be tested.\n    *   Marketing will open a media platform.\n*   The second stage is a cooperation test with the goal of allowing AI NPCs to appear on other fields and expand the application map.\n    *   More scenes will be created to welcome more Decentraland residents, and NPCs will be arranged in appropriate scenes.\n    *   More land owners will be contacted to customize AI residents for them.\n    *   Marketing will collaborate with KOLs, artists, and media.\n*   The third stage will open full-scale operations after completing the first two testing stages, and more players can participate in it.\n    *   Activities will be held in Decentraland.\n    *   The participation of media will be another measurable indicator in this stage.\n*   The fourth stage will add more logic to AI NPCs and enhance their social abilities.\n    *   Attempting to have AI residents form their own relationship network actively in Decentraland, without the need for our team to set initial values for these AI residents.\n    *   A plan is in place to allow users to observe the social status of these AI residents.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should the DAO implement a mechanism to delegate VP to multiple wallets?",
    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Should the DAO implement a mechanism to delegate VP to multiple wallets?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f7d61af0-a2f3-11ed-a669-05ba4b332980)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal is about implementing a multi-address voting power delegation mechanism in Polygon and Ethereum which will allow members to delegate their voting power to multiple delegates.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal suggests implementing a new smart contract for a multi-address voting power delegation mechanism in Polygon and Ethereum to enable members to delegate their voting power to multiple wallet addresses. The proposal aims to lower gas fees, increase transparency, and enable a more representative decision-making process. This will be achieved by creating a new multi-delegation contract, deploying it to Polygon, creating a new snapshot strategy, and updating the Governance dApp. The proposal will also contribute to the decentralized ecosystem by making it available to other DAOs.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, voting power delegation in our DAO is limited to delegating to a single wallet address. That means that if a wallet has 1000VP, it can only delegate the totality of that VP to another address. At the moment, the walkaround to delegate VP to multiple users is first to transfer your tokens to multiple wallets and then delegate VP from each one of those wallets. This, and the fact that delegation is only available in Ethereum Mainnet, increases the cost of delegation due to the need for multiple transactions (At least one for transferring tokens and another one to delegate).\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal has two main objectives:\n\n*   Create a new smart contract to delegate VP to multiple wallets, instead of a 1:1 delegation. The way this delegation will work is going to be using an even split, where the VP in a wallet will be delegated evenly between all the delegates the delegator wants to choose.\n*   Deploy this contract in Ethereum Mainnet and Polygon. The rationale behind this is to use an L2 network to lower the gas fees even more, but also to honor the existing delegations and to give users the choice of where they want to perform the delegation transaction.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\n*   Lower gas fees: Delegating to multiple addresses will require fewer transactions, leading to lower gas fees for members. Also deploying the smart contract in Polygon will lead to even lower fees than delegating in Mainnet.\n\n*   Increased transparency: Allowing members to delegate to multiple addresses will make it more transparent for anyone to see another user's different delegates.\n\n*   Improved voting power distribution: Allowing members to delegate to multiple addresses will enable a more distributed voting power, resulting in a more representative decision-making process.\n\n\\-Contribution to the decentralized ecosystem: This will be available for any other DAO that wants to use it. Currently, the [reference smart contract for 1:1 delegation](https://github.com/gnosis/delegate-registry) has been built by Gnosis SAFE (Now SAFE DAO). With this contribution, we will be putting the Decentraland DAO as a reference in decentralized governance technologies.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n*   Create a new [multi-delegation contract](https://github.com/yemel/multi-delegation) that will enable a user to delegate to several addresses.\n*   Deploy multi-delegation contract to Polygon as it has lower transaction fees than Mainnet.\n*   Deploy new subgraph indexing events from the new multi-delegation contract. Tentatively it may be a hosted service in TheGraph, but as TheGraph is sunsetting the hosted services, we will need to use another indexer.\n*   Create a new snapshot strategy in [snapshot-strategies repo](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies). This strategy should read previous delegations from the already existing snapshot-subgraph, according to the space network configured, and from our new delegations subgraph in Polygon. This will enable us to keep supporting already set delegations, while at the same time enabling multi-delegation. VP will be evenly split between all delegated addresses. (E.g: If an address with 150VP delegates to three addresses, each address will receive 50VP)\n*   Update the Governance dApp\n    Display all delegates based on the new subgraph on the profile\n    Delegate user will use the new multi-delegation contract\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed solution to implement a multi-address voting power delegation mechanism in our DAO will address the limitations of the current delegation mechanism, resulting in a more efficient and transparent delegation process. By enabling members to delegate their voting power to multiple wallet addresses and in cheaper networks (Polygon), we can reduce gas fees, increase transparency, and enable a more representative decision-making process.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Second Escape Room: Tier One Request for 1,500USD",
    "body": "> by 0x47efbc28db0f1fb3f94c54c8df11955abfc83bdb (Quesunmetaverso)\n\nShould the following $1,500 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nSecond Escape Room is the second version of a series of interactive games. The objective is for players to get out of the scene in a certain amount of time. We want it not only to be a game of movement with the avatar but also to make them think in order to solve the puzzles. Players who manage to finish the escape room will be given a personalized escape room wearable and a POAP as a reward to encourage participation.\n\nWe intend this to be a long series of monthly changing escape rooms to create a strong engagement with Decentraland users.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n1,500 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n1 month\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x47eFbC28dB0F1Fb3f94c54C8dF11955abFC83bdb\n\n## Email address\n\neventsdecentraland@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nAs mentioned above, we have already conducted one alpha tests in which a small number of players have participated and have given us their feedback in order to find areas for improvement.\nThe points to improve with the help of the funds are the following:\n\n*   Improve the 3D modeling design.\n*   Optimize the 3D components to improve the loading speed.\n*   User experience improvements to make puzzles more understandable for players.\n*   Offering rewards to encourage participation.\n\nThese are the reasons for the funding request.\n\nOn the other hand, we have refactored the game logic to facilitate the creation of subsequent Escape Rooms quickly. This code will be open and shared at the end of the project in order to stimulate and facilitate other builders to create more interactive scenarios.\n\nWe believe we can bring something different to the table, aided by our programming skills and Decentraland Editor SDK knowledge. This allows us to create a much more interactive game for the user with the objects, allowing the user to feel a greater immersion within this metaverse.\n\nOur ultimate goal is twofold, to perform an advanced data analysis of user behavior within the platform in order to know what they expect from the metaverse and thus improve their experience. We have a data engineer for this and we intend to perform this measurement through Wemeta and Google Analytics 4 tools in order to measure all user interactions based on events.\nThe second objective is to attract new users to Decentraland by attracting companies to carry out Teambuildings with their teams, since we think that the Escape Room is a good game to strengthen team dynamics. In these teambuildings we will take the opportunity to explain the operation of Decentraland and its possibilities outside our land in order to create commitment to this metaverse. To carry out this part, we have a member with 6 years of experience working as an event planner for companies and we see the real possibility of being able to offer virtual events as well.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n1: Core Development\nDuring the first 20 days we will work on all the improvements specified above:\n\n*   Opmitization and redesign of 3D models\n    \\-user experience improvements\n    \\-weareable creation\n    \\-custom data measurement\n\n2: Testing\nTesting is currently underway, as the Beta of the game has been published in Decentraland for two weeks where a small group of players have tested it and have given us feedback on the points to improve. You can find in the land 26,-143 to see the DEMO.\nWe have used this feedback to specify the points of improvement described above.\n\n4: Public Launch:\nOn May 15th we will publish the game in Decentraland. During this time we will carry out campaigns in social networks to promote it.\nWe will also offer the game for free to different companies for teambuilding with their teams.\n\n5: Measurement data analytics\nOnce the game is published, we will start working on the dashboards creation using the data measured from users interactions in the evento. We will use these dashboards in order to draw conclusions to further improve the user experience in the following versions of Escape rooms.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Proposal for Recognition of Decentraland in Future Grant Recipient Projects (POLL)",
    "body": "> by 0x7bbea9c18cd0541acab8c19da2b11d0c03faef1c (1Existence)\n\nObjective:\nTo ensure that all future Decentraland grant recipients prominently acknowledge the support they receive from Decentraland, whether on their website, marketing materials, or other relevant platforms. Currently only the Sponorship category has any requirement for making brand awareness.  While most grantees may already do some of these things, it should be made clear to all grantees that Decentraland should be recognized in some way for it's role.\n\nProposal:\nWe propose that all future Decentraland grant agreements include specific requirements for grant recipients to prominently recognize the support of Decentraland in their projects. This will help raise awareness of Decentraland's role in supporting innovation and community initiatives within the virtual world, while also enhancing the platform's visibility and reputation.\n\nRequirements for Grant Recipients:\n\nWebsite Acknowledgment:\nGrant recipients must include a clearly visible acknowledgment of Decentraland's support on their project's main website. This acknowledgment should consist of the Decentraland logo, a brief statement of support, and a link to the Decentraland website.\n\nFor example:\n\"This project is generously supported by Decentraland. Visit \\[Decentraland's website] to learn more about their commitment to fostering innovation and creativity within the virtual world.\"\n\nMarketing Materials:\nAll marketing materials related to the grant-supported project, including press releases, event materials, and promotional content, must feature the Decentraland logo and an acknowledgment of the grant. This can be included as a footnote, banner, or other appropriate formats.\n\nSocial Media and Public Announcements:\nGrant recipients should acknowledge Decentraland's support in any social media posts or public announcements related to the project. This can be done by tagging Decentraland's official social media accounts and using appropriate hashtags (e.g., #DecentralandGrant).\n\nProject Presentations and Events:\nIf the grant-supported project involves any public presentations, workshops, or events, grant recipients must recognize Decentraland's support during such activities. This can be done through verbal acknowledgment, displaying the Decentraland logo, or including a slide or banner acknowledging the grant in any presentations.\n\nReporting Requirements:\nGrant recipients must provide regular progress reports to Decentraland, including a summary of how the acknowledgment requirements have been met. This should include links to the website, copies of marketing materials, and documentation of any events or presentations where Decentraland's support was acknowledged.\n\nConclusion:\nBy implementing these requirements for future grant recipients, we can ensure that Decentraland receives appropriate recognition for its contributions to the growth and development of the virtual world. This will not only benefit Decentraland's visibility but also help foster a sense of community and collaboration among the various projects supported by the platform.\n\n- YES\n- NO\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Its motivation is to confirm the selection of one committee member, who was pre-selected by the Grant Support Squad based on their professional background, technical knowledge, trustworthiness, and presented to the community for answering questions and receiving feedback.\nThe outcome of this proposal will be the confirmation of the selected committee member.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO needs to appoint members to the Revocations Committee to ensure a robust and transparent governance process for resolving disputes related to the revocation of grants. The committee member selection process is crucial to ensure the right candidates are chosen based on objective criteria such as professional background, their contributions to the Decentraland DAO technical knowledge, and trustworthiness within the community.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis Binding Governance Proposal confirms the selection of one committee member for the Revocations Committee based on their pre-selection by the Grant Support Squad, and feedback from the community during the open [Q\\&A session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTUBjDI9xI),.

Its motivation is to confirm the selection of one committee member, who was pre-selected by the Grant Support Squad based on their professional background, technical knowledge, trustworthiness, and presented to the community for answering questions and receiving feedback.\nThe outcome of this proposal will be the confirmation of the selected committee member, which will then proceed to the Binding Governance Proposal stage for formal appointment to the Revocations Committee.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO needs to appoint members to the Revocations Committee to ensure a robust and transparent governance process for resolving disputes related to the revocation of grants. The committee member selection process is crucial to ensure the right candidates are chosen based on objective criteria such as professional background, their contributions to the Decentraland DAO technical knowledge, and trustworthiness within the community.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis  Binding Governance Proposal confirms the selection of one committee member for the Revocations Committee based on their pre-selection by the Grant Support Squad, and feedback from the community during the open [Q\\&A session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzTUBjDI9xI),. The selected candidates who could not attend the mentioned live session,  answered asynchronously in the  [dedicated Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/894658869391933540/1080892168245358722/1087474954230059029)\\\nHere is some relevant information about the member:\n\n**Dax:** Experience in Decentraland as a land owner since the genesis auction in 2017, an active and trusted member of the community, technical expertise, experience being a grantee leading DCL Metrics. Check out the application [here](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-for-accountability-committee-members/17546/2?u=zino).\n\nAlso, the pre-proposal poll about this candidate **passed with 99% of VP (4.293.776VP) in favor**, and the Draft proposal **passed with 98%** of VP (4,298,133) in favor.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe confirmation of the selected committee member will bring valuable skills, knowledge, and expertise to the Revocations Committee and contribute to the effective resolution of disputes related to revoked projects. Worst-case scenario, the member could be removed by an Internal decision of the Revocations Committee or by the community, through a proposal according [the Revocations Committee Framework](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ce104d00-7d94-11ed-8456-a323c09ee17e)\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n*   The voting will be done through a snapshot and will be public.\n*   Only members of the committee will be authorized to vote.\n*   They will vote with a token, that they will have in their public addresses.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Revocations Committee is an essential part of the DAO's governance process, and this Binding Governance proposal serves to confirm the selection of one committee member based on objective criteria and community feedback. By ensuring a robust and transparent selection process, the DAO can uphold its commitment to fair and effective governance, ultimately benefiting all stakeholders involved.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

We have been in existence since March 2022. We hold offline and online events to train specialists in web3 technologies. Among our teachers and partners are employees of such companies as Binance, Rarible, XDao, Coinbase, Kucoin and many others. Our team consists of 3 founders and 20 teachers and speakers. My personal experience consists of 18 years in marketing, of which 7 years I have been engaged in marketing communications of centralized crypto exchanges. You can read more about me here https://ae.linkedin.com/in/timzinin\n\nThe name Botanica comes from the Russian word БОТАТЬ (to make botany). In Russian slang it means \"to learn lessons\" or \"to play a nerd\". We started this project because we want to help millions of Russian-speaking people (both Russians and Ukrainians) who find themselves in exile find a new job in the web3 sector.

    "title": "Integrating Decentraland with Leading E-commerce Platforms",
    "body": "> by 0xea5fed1d0141f14de11249577921b08783d6a360 (GabeDG)\n\nShould the following $150,000 grant in the Accelerator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nOur proposal aims to create a seamless integration between Decentraland and major e-commerce platforms such as Magento, WooCommerce, and Shopify. This will enable brands to establish and manage their virtual stores in Decentraland, offering users an immersive shopping experience that blends the convenience of online shopping with the excitement of exploring physical retail spaces\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n150,000 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n12 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x9243C7F89737775413b55DcB3D9237Cb20618a3b\n\n## Email address\n\n0xgabe23@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nE-commerce has revolutionized the way we shop, but it has also taken away the joy of exploring retail spaces with friends and family. Our project aims to bring back this experience by integrating Decentraland with leading e-commerce platforms. Brands will be able to connect their online stores to their Decentraland scenes, allowing users to browse products, add items to their carts, and complete purchases within the metaverse. This not only benefits users but also provides brands with a new revenue stream and an opportunity to engage customers in a unique, immersive environment.\n\nIn order to develop the e-commerce integration with Decentraland, we will begin by exporting the brand's product catalog, which contains essential information such as price, color, variations, and availability. To create a visually appealing shopping experience within the metaverse, we will dynamically remove the background of each product image.\n\nThe  web dashboard will enable brands to easily manage their virtual stores. They can select products from their catalog to offer for sale and decide where to place them within their Decentraland scene.  We will have a set of 3D modules in which the products will be displayed nicely and in which the users will be able to interact as if they were inside the store for real.\n\nTo make shopping as smooth as possible, we will develop a comprehensive module for creating an unique account which would work with any ecommerce that integrates this module, adding items to a user's cart and checking out directly within the metaverse. This module will handle all aspects of the shopping process, from browsing products to confirming the order.\n\nFurthermore, we will create a set of API methods to seamlessly integrate with the brand's existing e-commerce platform. These API methods will enable the automatic creation of orders on the brand's e-commerce system and facilitate the payment process for users. This integration ensures that brands can efficiently manage their virtual and physical store sales while providing users with a secure and convenient shopping experience in Decentraland.\n\nThese are a couple of reasons of why we believe this would really benefit decentraland:\n\nShopping User Experience: Integrating e-commerce within Decentraland will give users a reason to spend more time in the metaverse. Users can explore virtual stores and shop with friends from around the world.\n\nAttracting Brands and Driving Monetization: Decentraland can attract more brands looking to establish a presence in the metaverse. This, in turn, creates new revenue streams for Decentraland, as well as for the brands themselves, through virtual store sales and potential advertising opportunities.\n\nLeverage on metaverse E-commerce:  E-commerce is predicted to become one of the main sources of revenue in the metaverse by 2030, offering an integrated e-commerce solution can help solidify this business vertical.\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/gkckvyHM/4607fe1b-0eb7-4f01-bfe9-ad7074630183.jpg\n\nIn other words, this product can generate experiences inside the metaverse which are not dependant on time, users can join at any time and shop around. At the same time, it allows brands to develop content inside decentraland and find a way to actually monetize them to keep on building and not just doing one marketing activation and leave an empty scene.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n*   Develop a web dashboard for e-commerce managers to select products and configure their virtual stores\n*   Implement the metaverse component to enable users to browse and purchase products within Decentraland\n*   Launch a pilot program with select brands to test the integration\n*   Gather feedback and refine the integration based on user and brand experiences\n*   Full-scale launch and onboarding of additional brands\n*   Continual updates and improvements based on evolving user and brand needs\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

VIPsm helps to keep users engaged and remain longer  in DCL.\n\nVIPsm aim to be a key enabler which will help DCL excel in the above two metrics by providing a proven service -streaming video content - couple with two way communication between content creators and content consumers increasing the platforms user engagement and providing added incentive to attract more users, growing the platform's user base.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x73b0d3e4f7647736aAD489A9Cad98e1a1F7C3549\n\n## Email address\n\nvipstreamingmedia@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nBusiness goal: To increase space retention with compelling interactive and engaging video streaming experiences.\n\nConcept: VIPsm is asking for your vote to help fund its idea to design and develop a streaming media platform to allow independent content creators, whether that be an entity or individual, to stream live and recorded video content to Decentraland users on a one to one or one to many setting.\n\nTo make the platform sustainable, VIPsm will receive a percentage of the fee charged by content creators which may include a combination of a pay-per-view and/or subscription.\n\nWe are asking for a one-time grant that will help us build the VIP streaming media service into Decentraland.\n\nIdea:\n\nTo create a platform which will allow content creators of all kinds to produce video content for DCL members including live video chat, live streaming one-on-one video interaction, entertainment experiences, and recorded streaming content.\n\nVIPsm service work this way:\n\nUsers enter DCL, and navigate to the VIPsm town where they find the VIPsm cafe, inside the cafe is a menu with a list of content creators, offering streaming service. The menu will also contain a link where the DCL user can learn more about the streamer, see their profile, photos, and the additional details about the services they offer.\n\nWhen the user selects a stream from the menu, the user will have two options: basic, which is free, and premium will be paid: per use/interaction or subscription.\n\nAfter the user selects an option, a screen appears allowing the user to view the live streaming content, and communicate with the streamer via chat text message or audio. The live stream is broadcast and shared with multiple users, but a DCL member will have an option for private screaming content.\n\nPERSONNEL\nThe core team consists of three content creators,  developers, architect  experienced with streaming video and metaverse development.

    "body": "> by 0x8b257b97c0e07e527b073b6513ba8ea659279b61 (Morph)\n\nRecently, the community has engaged in an investigation over the handling of District X, and the current leadership of RobL#4045.\n\nThis investigation has brought to light several issues:\n\n*   @RobL became custodian of District X without contributor’s input; when the original custodians left, Rob took leadership custody, alongside Carl F via a centralized decision by original leadership who could not continue.\n\n*   The land is sitting in a wallet with multi-sig, controlled by an LLC that is owned entirely by Rob and a ‘partner’, no contributors were given a share despite original contributor agreement mentioning shared purchase/ownership of land.\n\n*   Rob has removed all rights from contributors, stating that he owes them nothing, and that the land is his to control.\n\n*   Rob’s contribution to district X is believed to be 2 parcels out of 2,001 total (.099%)\n\n*   However, the worst offense - Rob has attempted to sell the entire district (by transferring ownership of the LLC), for 7-8 figures. Rob did not consult contributors, when confronted - he states the assets are his and his partners to do as they please, including selling it in its entirety and keeping the money.\n\nWe believe this is wrong for a few reasons:\n\n1.) - The custodians of districts were always intended to be just that, custodians. Their job was to uphold a system in which contributors could consult or be consulted - when a custodian could no longer act in the best interests of the district, leadership should return to the foundation/DAO/new leadership to continue the vision. We have seen this occur before with Rob being brought on via centralized decision by previous leadership once they could not continue.\n\n2.) - The district has completely pivoted from its original intent, while this may be acceptable in some circumstances, the decision was made by Rob without consultation of contributors. Rob has not upheld any critical pieces of the original contributor agreement nor the district foundation agreement - after five years and lack of progress, this is a massive failure, and solidifies that Rob not only has no intent to sufficiently develop the district, but also refuses to use existing methods of tracking contributor involvement on the direction - this is further complicated by Rob banning contributors who disagree, or outright deleting history/channels/servers/accounts (like the District X twitter).\n\n3.) - Contributors have made multiple attempts since 2019 to raise these issues, they were either silenced by bans, or outright told they had no rights to District involvement.\nWhen raising this issue, either by contributors, or DCL’s community in general, Rob’s response has been ‘sue me’ and that he is the true ‘owner’ of these contributed lands, despite him being rumored to only have contributed 2 parcels / 200 mana himself and little to no relevant district development occurring.\n\nSo that’s where we are now, a user who had a small contribution to district X, was deputized without the contributor’s agreement, and now has outright taken the land hostage via an LLC, refusing to release it even after 5 years of failed district leadership.\n\nI believe that we as a community should do what we can to agree on a short term solution until this can be resolved by the involved parties amicably; With the evidence linked, and the fact that Rob has maliciously acted in defying contributors & the district X agreements, we should:\n\n**MARK THE DISTRICT AS STOLEN ON OPENSEA & MARKETPLACE UNTIL THIS IS RESOLVED**\n\nWe MUST protect future buyers from buying District X, only to find it comes with community baggage, agreements, and contributors that were supposed to be involved in decision making. We must prevent contributors from being silenced/banned and removed while their contribution is on-sold without their consent by a leader who has abandoned the outlined agreements and original contracts of contribution for personal profit.\n\nPlease note that this would require the DAO to work with the Foundation on submitting a proposal to OpenSea and that these changes would not prevent Rob from pursuing district X lead duties.\n\nYou can find further evidence and past discussions as well as participate on this topic in the Decentraland DAO's #district discord channel: https://discord.com/channels/894658869391933540/1074369083228815390\n\nYou can also read some shorter summaries here:\nhttps://realdistrictx.medium.com/district-x-on-decentraland-a8e10279e874\nhttps://www.playdcl.games/post/decentraland-s-district-x-the-x-is-for-fraud\n\n- Mark district X NFT as stolen on OpenSea & DCL Marketplace\n- Do not mark District X NFT as stolen\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x017fbadca2dbc267bb046624f23831662a6fd718 (BPVerse)\n\nShould the following $120,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAt Butterfly Prawn Farm (BPF), we created an unprecedented Free-To-Play (F2P), Play-to-Earn (P2E) farm game, where players AKA farmers can harvest plants, collect resources and compete in different monthly events for rewards (wearables and emotes).\n\nThe team prioritizes the player’s experience in BPF, and we want to elevate the BPF experience further. Thus, we envisage the continuation of development in BPF, with many new and fresh mechanics that intertwine with existing features. Being a staple in Decentraland (DCL), BPF had more than 30000 unique visitors in the last 90 days and an average of more than 4000 weekly sessions for the last 8 months, and we strive to attract more visitors into DCL and represent DCL on an international scale.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x017fBaDCA2Dbc267Bb046624F23831662A6Fd718\n\n## Email address\n\nbutterflyprawnfarm@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe Butterfly Prawn Farm (BPF) is a F2P, P2E farm game that aims to create an easy-to-play Metaverse game in Decentraland (DCL) for the whole community. BPF's goal is to continuously boost and engage the community in DCL. With a delivered Minimum Viable Product (MVP), BPF aims to push the boundaries, building onto fresh and advanced features, catering to farmers (aka players) with months of mileage. Similarly, BPF continues to attract new farmers through the next phase of development (details in the Dropbox link).\n\nThis baseline game product currently allows the farmers to harvest crops, catch farm animals, perform crafting, ascend the Magic Beanstalk, and scout the Cloud Castle. Being one of the top P2E games in DCL, BPF also offers multiple activities and monthly events with wearable/emote rewards. Furthermore, BPF has also been known to be setting standards on compliance, and introducing new and innovative wearable/emote utilities in DCL.\n\nCurrently, with high traction, the game quickly propelled seasoned/advanced farmers toward the end of the game. As a result, the team seeks to adhere to the level of dedication and motivation to continue developing advanced features for seasoned farmers. The team is also planning to develop new features to engage new farmers and provide seasoned farmers with more activities within the farm. With the drive to further BPF’s cause to the community and DCL, the team would like to seek funding from the community in this expansion plan. The team also strongly believes that the funding and support will value-add, boost, retain, and engage the community.\n\nThe team consists of 7 team members with a vast set of skills and experience. Our collaborative experiences include full-stack (frontend & backend) software development and deployment, product management, 2D/3D product design, and operations support.\n\nExperience aside, we are a group of game enthusiasts. Passionate and inspired by the Metaverse, we have been actively developing and deploying new features in BPF frequently while tapping into our expertise. We always aim to serve and attract the DCL community better, through one-of-a-kind events, gameplay, and wearables!\n\nOur team believes in delivering only the best for DCL community. As we tap into our expertise, the team applies agile development (SCRUM), where we have meetings (daily stand-up and fortnightly sprints) to be kept abreast of development progress, design updates, ideation, and retrospectives.\n\nCollaboration:\nApart from developing BPF, the team believes in doing what is best for the DCL community as well. Because of this, we actively foster collaboration and compliance. Below is a list of projects/community we collaborated and engaged in during the last grant.\n\n1.  Curation station library\n2.  Meta GamiMall\n3.  Meta Residence Tower\n4.  Decentraland Blog Post, written by Yurius, the product manager\n5.  Project management monthly meeting with video demonstration and metrics to the Grant Support Squad for compliance\n6.  Monthly reports for compliance\n\nDropbox Link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zmlz0a4pji2tmxm/AAA8nUzmPQvs6\\_uDn3SPd3hDa?dl=0\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nPrevious funds:\nThe team developed the baseline for BPF, as explained in the Description. The team also launched 23 wearables and 3 emotes with a variety of utilities. There were also many concepts BPF tried which were not provisioned for in the previous proposal. Some examples are vehicles in the farm, BPFrost, and Wanderer Shop Exchange which was the fan favorite. These new concepts brought variety to the BPF for farmers to truly enjoy the game.\n\nReceiving funds:\nRefer to the specifications for an in-depth breakdown\n\nPhase 1:\n\n1.  Cloud Castle Expansion\n2.  New plots with new utility\n3.  Plot logic and new materials\n4.  Harvest and fertilizer logic\n\nPhase 2:\n\n1.  Animal farm (Rearing of farm animals with produce)\n2.  Development of animals (Design/logic)\n3.  Purchases and frontend design/logic\n4.  Backend design/logic\n5.  Produce and expiry logic\n6.  Passive effects\n\nOngoing development throughout 6 months:\n\n1.  Marketplace trading\n2.  New Vehicle Concept\n3.  Weather\n4.  Overall gameplay and server improvements\n5.  New wearables\n6.  Monthly events and rewards\n7.  Technical debts and bug fixes\n8.  Cybersecurity improvements\n\nThe team is accountable to the community. There will be monthly updates via social media platforms and active engagement with the community. Suggestions, bug reporting, and discussions are taken seriously and the team looks to implement practical and favorable ideas.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Connecting Decentraland with Ready Player Me",
    "body": "> by 0x403fa2da716cc36df9eedbf9c6dd6a9b6b314326 (SteezyArts)\n\nWe propose connecting Decentraland, a virtual world platform, with Ready Player Me, a platform that allows users to create and customize 3D avatars for use across various virtual worlds and games. By integrating the two platforms, we aim to provide Decentraland users with a seamless and customizable avatar creation experience while increasing engagement and user retention on both platforms.\n\nBenefits:\n\nImproved Avatar Creation: The integration of Ready Player Me's avatar creation tools with Decentraland would provide users with a comprehensive and user-friendly avatar creation experience. This would allow Decentraland users to create unique and customizable avatars to represent them in the virtual world, increasing their engagement and investment in the platform.\n\nIncreased User Engagement: The integration of Ready Player Me would allow users to seamlessly import their avatars across various virtual worlds and games, increasing their investment and engagement across multiple platforms. This would also increase the retention rate of users on both platforms, as users would be invested in their avatars and would want to continue using them across various platforms.Example Somnium Space,VR chat,Hiber,and Meetinvr.\n\nCommunity Building: The integration of Ready Player Me would allow for increased community building and social interactions between Decentraland and Ready Player Me users. Users could share and show off their avatars across both platforms, leading to increased engagement and participation in both communities.\n\nIncreased Revenue: As users become more invested in their avatars and the Decentraland platform, it is likely that they would be more willing to spend money on virtual goods and experiences. This would increase revenue for both Decentraland and Ready Player Me, as users would be more likely to purchase items to customize their avatars and enhance their virtual experiences.\n\nImplementation:\n\nSteezyArts, a team with experience in virtual world and gaming integrations, would handle the technical implementation of the integration. This would involve working with both the Decentraland and Ready Player Me teams to create a seamless integration that benefits both platforms.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe integration of Decentraland and Ready Player Me would provide users with a customizable and engaging avatar creation experience while increasing engagement and revenue for both platforms. We believe that this integration would be a valuable addition to both platforms and look forward to working with the Decentraland and Ready Player Me teams to make it a reality.\n\nFurthermore, we believe that connecting various virtual worlds and metaverse platforms together at one central platform can help to grow the metaverse in many parts. This can lead to increased adoption, better user engagement, and more opportunities for creators to monetize their content. We hope that the Decentraland community will support this proposal and join us in this exciting endeavor to grow and connect the metaverse.\n\n- yes\n- no\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

With a major overhaul and big improvements in the overall usability in its newest version, the next planned release will further improve the modeling workflow, have a **UI Editor**, offer **no-code behaviors** for implementing logic without the need to code and a first set of **Web3 components** that allow easy access to common Web3 services. This will pave the way for onboarding many more creators and artists into Decentraland. Furthermore, it will support the newest Decentraland SDK 7 and it will be designed to complement the existing official Visual Studio Extensions.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2a9Da28bCbF97A8C008Fd211f5127b860613922D\n\n## Email address\n\ncamilo.echeverri@thedac.info\n\n## Description\n\nDCL-Edit is a cornerstone of the development environment for DCL, giving developers the opportunity to build their experiences as professionals do in established game engines. In fact, it already has a nice set of features that make it a very powerful tool (see a full feature list [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1\\_FzQiPVecQF7xZxNPLmnQsRk2zhdbFXz4d1Eif3mgX4/edit#heading=h.jx2btqeytdvd)).\n\nStill, there’s much potential to further improve DCL-Edit and make it yet more useful for experts. Also, there is a need to attract creators and artists of all kinds into DCL. This is the year of the creators and MGH is committed to help provide the necessary toolsets.\n\nWe will improve the tool in four key areas:\n\n*   Improved modeling workflows.\n*   Provide a non-code UI Editor.\n*   Add a sophisticated set of non-code behaviors to allow the creation of complex behaviors directly in DCL-Edit  without the need to code.\n*   Provide easy access to Web3 features like selling NFTs right out of the box.\n\nThe no-code components will be a driving factor for drawing in creators of all kinds and lowering the entry barrier for non technical developers. This will open the door for many creative minds in 2023 and raise the number of expected contributions.\n\nYou can see all the planned features in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MC5R0Qjp4g8xsIbdxoXkEkr-qRhXltGf3ri\\_\\_i8Iotc/edit#).\n\nYou can find a cost breakdown for all the planned features in [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UGAyUAUFqcX8k0c3nsN04XLNrNZr28E9RpXuef_Ihl0/edit#gid=0).\n\nRegarding the Web3 features, we’ll be leveraging our partners in Web3 like Fitchin (Web3 ESports), Boson Protocol (Web3 E-commerce) and others. The latest DCL-Edit V2 has been built to make it easy to add functionalities via new components, so using this for integrating those partners and their services in the future is key . See more about our partners  in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IzMYd_IypLvmr7Kfa9BgLFx5KUr1oF4GlM9-s4cgx2E/edit#).\n\nDCL-Edit will evolve as a visual scene editor complementary to other initiatives like the Visual Studio extensions and DCL Connect. We are aligning each of our steps with the major contributors on the platform.\n\nMGH's goal is not just providing tools. There are initiatives that are aimed at drawing in as many professionals as possible like our bi-weekly coding sessions on Twitch. We’ll be doing more in this area, starting with a screenshot Sunday on Twitter  and the announcement of a builder of the month  with a price, quarterly Game Jams and more.\n\nSince metaverse standards are slowly forming, one other thing we’re aiming at is the adoption of those standards as early as possible. We are identifying strong candidates for standaradization like the USD file format and plan to integrate those into DCL-Edit where it makes sense (e.g. exporting a Decentraland scene to USD / importing USD scenes into Decentraland and make our component system work on other platforms).\n\nDCL-Edit has received much positive feedback for its latest version, and previous game jams have seen 16/20 winning submissions using our tool. We are on the right track!\n\nA professional scene editor is indispensable for DCL to survive against the competition. By supporting our efforts, you help developers, creators, and artists of any kind create a new era of virtual worlds and decentralized applications.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nBelow are the planned milestones including the planned intermediate releases for each month. More details about each step can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VQ7T8jrhs6rsq7IfK-8Jf57JGfGsVXQUqQ_DeTHH008/edit#).\n\n**May 2023 - Version 2.1**\n\n*   SDK 7 compatibility.\n*   VS Code extension (launch DCL-Edit within VS Studio).\n\n**June 2023 - Version 2.2**\n\n*   Render like Decentraland client.\n*   Live Model Update, includes support for Blender and USD files (.blend and .usdx)\n    scene optimization.\n\n**July 2023 - Version 3 Alpha**\n\n*   First set of no-code components.\n*   Variable containers.\n*   Triggers.\n*   Mathematics.\n*   Counter.\n*   User metrics & accounts.\n\n**August 2023 - Version 3 Beta**\n\n*   Second set of premade components.\n*   State Machine.\n*   Audio Source.\n*   NFT component.\n*   Speaker.\n*   UI Editor.\n*   Text, Buttons, Progress bars, Images.\n\n**September 2023 - Physics Package**\n\n*   An independent installable package that enables physics for Decentraland scenes\n    feature freeze and final preparations for release in October.\n\n**October 2023 - Release of Version 3.0**\n\n*   Stable and tested version of DCL-Edit including the features mentioned above.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This initial scope (v1.0.0) would prioritise integrations with existing asset libraries and exporting tools:\n\n*   Seamlessly integrate 3D models and scenes from the Decentraland avatar-assets and builder-assets  repositories\n*   Design/develop UI within Blender:\n    *   Asset Gallery\n    *   Generating thumbnails for assets\n*   Welcome message / video tutorial\n*   Github wiki\n*   Video tutorial and documentation (github wiki)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nScope:\n\n*   Add-on allowing Importing of models from Decentraland asset repos into Blender\n*   Add-on UI with Decentraland Asset gallery in Blender\n*   Video Tutorial\n*   Github wiki and documentation and submission to Blender Community\n\nThis work will be divided over the course of two, two-week sprints :\n\nSprint 1 (Design):\n\n*   UX/Design of UI\n*   Creation of Video Tutorial\n    *   Upload to youtube/vimeo\n*   Creation of public repo / wiki\n\nSprint 2 (Development):\n\n*   Add-on development in python\n    *   Creation of tool features (Blender Python SDK)\n    *   Employing Blender python code guidelines and best practises\n*   Testing (User and CI/CD)\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

I have been producing content for the Spanish-speaking community for 2 years, mainly on YouTube, but also on Twitch, TikTok, and my website TokensGratis.com.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n12,000 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xDCAE1cd1Ce33Dd96416CADa0E4A583Dbdb8cc9ae\n\n## Email address\n\ninigo.echeverria.ibarrondo@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nDecentraland needs good ambassadors who can make this virtual world known to more and more people, so that through education we can eliminate the barriers that still exist for greater adoption. The audience that may be interested in Decentraland can be very diverse, from gaming enthusiasts to lovers of art and culture, or those who look for any opportunity to get free NFTs and wearables. My content aims to appeal to all these profiles, in a friendly and understandable way for all profiles. What good is it to organize festivals, collaborations, or alliances with big brands if they don't have the reach we all want, or there is no trace left once they're over?\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe idea is to continue the series of educational videos about Decentraland, as well as covering the different events and activities that happen weekly in the virtual world. With this, I establish a minimum of pieces of content every month:\n\n*   1 full-length video (over 10 minutes)\n*   2 short videos (for YouTube and TikTok)\n*   Keeping the guide on TokensGratis.com updated and complete\n*   From 1 to 3 weekly posts on Twitter about events within the world.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x8ec394bc6a794e7ea0b4fb75b29dd6c563649d4c (Lem)\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis is a follow-up proposal regarding “[Should Decentraland Worlds be integrated with Events and Places?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4fcffbc0-b9d0-11ed-8c13-518b5c1940be)”. Based on the community feedback, Decentraland Foundation hosted a World AMA and proposed a vision for Genesis City and Worlds ([check recordings history](https://www.notion.so/decentraland/Decentraland-Foundation-Technical-AMA-230fcf1ca1ec4d49922744fe91e6995d)).\n\nAs mentioned in the AMA, the [Worlds Content Server](https://github.com/decentraland/worlds-content-server) was developed as an open-source tool for Scene Preview ([Heroku alternative](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/deploy-third-party/)). Decentraland Foundation is hosting an instance of such a preview server and requesting deployments to be tight to a Decentraland NAME. The Explorer supports traveling to a scene from a preview server, using a direct link, typing a chat command, or being redirected by the current scene (like a portal).\n\nTo increase the adoption and utility of Decentraland Worlds, and to encourage more content creators to publish content utilizing the Decentraland platform, an integration between Worlds with [Places](http://places.decentraland.org/) is proposed. The original idea of integrating Worlds with Events is **out of the scope** of this poll.\n\n### Proposal\n\n*   [Places dApp](http://places.decentraland.org/) will list indexed Worlds.\n\n*   [The Explorer](http://play.decentraland.org/) will list indexed Worlds under the “Explore” menu section.\n\n*   Worlds deployed to Foundation’s World Content Server might be indexed automatically. Creators will be able to opt out of this functionality.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis poll aims to test the community sentiment and gather feedback about enabling the discoverability of published Worlds at [places.decentraland.org](https://places.decentraland.org/) and the Explorer.\n\nThe poll is considered a [product definition](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f33d4c40-a972-11ed-8dfe-4ff0ad4dfd32) and will not follow the standard Draft and Governance proposal stages, but is intended to guide the conversation about integrating Worlds into the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nPlease share your vote and comments about this feature.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xed0e0cb94f60f72ec94bef848f5df4cbd365af1d (InJesterr)\n\nShould the following $75,000 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nhttps://imgur.com/u9mCkvm\n\n**Duel Arena**\n\nOur project is the development of an immersive 3D game for the Decentraland platform. Our goal is to provide players with a unique gaming experience that combines parkour, team games, and strategic battles. One of our key features is the ability to crossover game progress between our 2D and 3D, allowing players to seamlessly continue their gameplay experience regardless of which mode they choose.\n\nOur 3D map is currently available for visitation at -86,47. By clicking on \"Play 2D,\" you can experience the 2D game mode while we continue developing the 3D version. Our ultimate goal is to make the 2D and 3D game modes identical, providing players with a seamless and consistent gaming experience.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n75,000 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xed0E0cb94F60F72ec94beF848f5dF4Cbd365aF1D\n\n## Email address\n\ninfo@duelarenap2e.com\n\n## Description\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nAs a team, we are excited to present our updated grant proposal for Duel Arena on Decentraland. We have taken the time to listen to the community's feedback and have worked hard to refine our 2D model while also developing the 3D version of the game.\n\nWe recently imported our game into WebGL, The community wanted the game to be directly accessible on DCL without a frame. As a result, we have made adjustments to our approach and have imported WebGL on a separate page but are working on a 3D game mode in DCL aswell.\n\nWe have also implemented a data storage system using PlayFab that enables players to make progress in either the 2D or 3D game, and it will carry over to the other platform. We believe that this feature will be a significant asset to the game and add value to the player experience.\n\nWe have a webpage for our proposal active for this proposal and will share a document with fundamentals.\n\nhttps://www.duelarenap2e.com/grant-proposal\n\n**Contributing to Decentraland's Growth:**\nAdditionally, we aim to contribute to the growth and success of the Decentraland platform. Our game will bring increased engagement and activity to the platform, and our data storage and crossover system will set a new standard for games on the platform.\n\n**Experienced Team:**\nOur team has the necessary skills and experience to make Duel Arena a success, and we are committed to creating a high-quality game that will meet the needs and expectations of the Decentraland community. We believe that our project deserves funding because of its unique features, potential benefits, and alignment with the vision and mission of the Decentraland platform.\n\n**Progress Made:**\nWhile we have made significant progress in the development of Duel Arena for the Decentraland platform, it's important to note that the 3D game is not yet finished. However, we have created a 2D game that is currently live and playable on itch.io. We have designed the 2D game to serve as a demo for the 3D game and showcase some of the features and content that we plan to include.\n\n**Battleground Map:**\nDespite the 3D game being a work in progress, we have made significant strides in its development, as outlined in the previous section. Our team is confident in our ability to complete the development of Duel Arena and deliver a high-quality game that will meet the needs and expectations of the Decentraland community. We have also developed a unique battleground map that is set on a floating platform above the 3D game map.\n\n**Functional Buttons and Wearables:**\nFurthermore, we have created several UI buttons such as Play 2D, Home, and Play Now. We have also developed functional buttons for gathering resources, including wood, fire, dandelions, and water. Winning battles will give players game currency that can be used to purchase wearable NFTs that give bonuses in-game.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOur team has made significant progress in the development of Duel Arena and is committed to creating a high-quality game that will meet the needs and expectations of the Decentraland community. We believe that our game has the potential to contribute to the growth and success of the platform, and we are excited to continue our work on this project.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/0i6oZgi\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Progress So Far**\n\n*   We released the stress test 2D version of our game in February 2023.\n*   We launched our fandom page on February in 2023.\n*   We submitted our first grant proposal, March in 2023.\n*   We created a 3D Map of the game and used the 2D one as a reference in March 2023.\n*   We started to host our 2D game through WebGL in March 2023.\n*   We added a full UI template on the 3D scene in March 2023.

Knowing this, MetaTrekkers wants to become the platform that brings the artist and metaverse-user communities together and rewards them for their participation in various series of entertainment events, sessions and talks.\n\nThe grant would cover the development, marketing and advertising of the events and innovative features aimed at improving the Decentraland user experience.\n\nBy expanding the brand awareness of Decentraland as a user engagement-focused metaverse, we are reaching out to new users interested in onboarding and attracting a new, important target – brands looking to adopt new “customer journey” technologies and solutions.\n\nTurning art and entertainment series like the MetaTrekkers x Venice Music Concerts or the BeatTrekkers DJ Battles into Decentraland resident events, we are ensuring a constant flow of metaverse newcomers originating from the artists’ fanbase. As a fresh experience for a new user, we want to offer a full range of engaging performances and means for them to showcase their art, all while being rewarded for their activity with metaverse-specific benefits provided by a large network of partner locations and projects spread all over Decentraland.\n\nThe funds from the DAO grant will serve to build the platform as a self-sustainable project that represents a portal for artists and fans across the planet, and from other metaverses, to access Decentraland and make it the go-to virtual world for entertainment and arts.\n\nBeatTrekkers\nCurrently the biggest DJ battle series of events in the metaverse, BeatTrekkers is MetaTrekkers’ biggest initiative to date as it engages twelve competing artists, guest artists, the Decentraland and MetaTrekkers community, plus new audiences – the participating artists’ metaverse-newbie fans and general public interested in the benefits associated with NFT music and being part of a developing metaverse community.\n\n![|440x220](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/G5v9HgXqfIRtHl2GddmOrJIreqs48-\\_Ybl2oZqmNfB9-XtW7c_wdMrOl6d3yCoeOkmYpm4yhFa0HiQXuHEpzWVbxVqutpkAjfZ5rfDkFNDxOxwraIsBo4eF8aYYauuZp6\\_qcT7NS_A93K9VYYI6aDNU)\n\n![|548x298](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bQPqDuxi00\\_4YzNY7mdvhuQ3I4u3hnSROqH5HXPPYwwjruxh0OcCV28zMPSrH818aMPAFEVTVQGLLI7fVMnBt9gGrq6Tsv7TeibLjvzufaXBPJnCL1cIrUnOBmH2rkppD2b9h6yz\\_7DCzioVrlD9hQ0)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nAs described above, the BeatTrekkers series of DJ battles took place over the course of 12 weeks with the final battle that took place in November 2022.

    "body": "> by 0xa8c7d5818a255a1856b31177e5c96e1d61c83991 (AndreusAs#3991)\n\nShould the following $240,000 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nA complex project of viral attraction of new users to Decentraland via a gamified platform\\social network that houses online educational courses for all the aspects of Decentraland content creation, a competitive model for presentation of user-made content to the community as well as monetization means for the said content. The project is designed to be fully integrated in the current Decentraland ecosystem, support the MANA flow and directly contribute to the treasury.\n\nThe aim of this project is to help new metaverse users by delivering the most important tools for mastering the brave new world of meta: knowledge and practical experience as well as convenient tools to utilize and demonstrate those skills in entertaining fashion.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n8 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xd2eD5CA455405E05055dcd66891b3bA97cC0E5F6\n\n## Email address\n\nmetafiends@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nDue to character limitations the full grant proposal text is here: https://shorturl.at/giqsJ\n\nMetaFiends – a viral attraction project which aims to attract lots of new users to Decentraland by offering them to join a continuous system of Entertainment-Learning-Profits (ELP) that will ultimately encourage them to stay in the metaverse becoming its active users.\n\nHow will it work?\nThe project consists of a gamified platform with social network elements, free educational online courses dedicated to all the aspects of Decentraland content creation, and the most attractive and entertaining element: two types of so-called “Challenges”: competition-driven, Decentraland-based games with prize funds used to reward those who beat them.\n\n1.Entertainment\nOur main audience are young active Internet users who are still not familiar with the metaverse.\n\nThe best place we can hook them at – social media of all kinds.\n\nThe best thing they can be hooked with – an occasion to express themselves in a completely new, entertaining, accessible way showing the end result to the world.\n\nWe merged these concepts with our ELP formula and invented a model of viral attraction activity – the “Challenges” mentioned earlier. Such an activity is an ideal way to acquaint new users with our project and engage them in the ELP system we propose. We believe that such an approach will make a thrilling experience for new users by the “first contact” with metaverse ultimately leading to them becoming active Decentraland users.\n\nThe core of the activity: utilizing simple, Decentraland-based drag-and-drop style construction kit (similar to the Builder) and short tutorial videos, new users of our project create simple, yet entertaining Decentraland games. It’s the first type of the “Challenges” mentioned earlier.\n\nOnce the game is finished, users can “challenge” their friends on social media to beat the game by posting a “story” (like on Instagram) or tweet containing the game’s link, a short auto-generated reel-like trailer of it and a list of friends who have been challenged.\n\nThe first one to beat the game receives a small bonus in MANA, and everyone who beats the game is encouraged to make their own “Simple challenge” by using the construction kit mentioned earlier.\n\nOnce the challenge is finished, it can be published for friends to beat, thus involving them into our ELP system!\n\n2.  Learning.\n    This part of the project incorporates the already mentioned tutorial videos for the construction kit but is not limited to it.\n\nOnce a user makes and publishes their “Simple challenge”, they are encouraged to begin an online learning course that is split into modules, contains ~90 lectures and includes everything one needs to know about creation of content for Decentraland. Each video lecture will be ~10 minutes long.\n\nThe whole educational course is free, but paid NFT certificates are planned for those who do homework and complete final tasks of the course. Both homeworks and final tasks are thoroughly examined by mentors.\n\nOnce certified, a user is ready to begin earning via our platform.\n\n3.  Profits.\n    The project will incorporate 6 ways to earn profits: beating simple challenges, developing and beating more advanced challenges with prize funds, promoting the project via social media, mentorship fees, becoming a project's ambassador and making new content for the platform.\n\nYou can find more by following the link with full proposal info: https://shorturl.at/giqsJ\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nROADMAP AND MILESTONES\n\n1.      Pre-production phase (2 months)\n\n*          creation of project’s documentation;\n*          creation of specs for the planned software solutions;\n*          creation of the educational course structure and conception;\n*          creation of the platform’s website structure;\n*          creation of scenarios and scripts for the course;\n*          creation of feedback forms for approbation participators, creation of necessary feedback metrics.\n\n2.

This will let them to choose and be more individual from the beggining as well as increasing interest to comeback to metaverse every day, every month\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n49,500 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n6 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x41eb5F82af60873b3C14fEDB898A1712f5c35366\n\n## Email address\n\ntheankoudev@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nHello, my name is Kristian (aka theankou, 3D Artist)\nI'm active Decentraland player and wearable creator since end of 2021 year.  And throughout time that i'm enjoying our beloved metaverse i have noted that:\n\nAmount  of standard wearables in inventory of each Decentraland player is not changing/increasing throughout time.\nMost of newcomers looks exactly the same, same shirt, same pants, same hairs,  body shapes. Which is veeeeery boring, especially when newcomers comes to big events.\n\nCurrently we have this amount of standard wearables:\n\n*   hair (both - 33)\n*   upper_body (female - 33, male - 13)\n*   lower_body (female- 22, male - 19)\n*   shoes (female -19, male - 15)\n*   eyewears (female -12, male - 9)\n*   earrings (female -11, male - 4\n*   tiara (female - 5, male - 2)\n*   mask (both- 0)\n*   hat (both - 0)\n*   helmet (both - 0)\n*   top_head (both - 0)\n*   skins (both - 0)\n\nCalculating and analyzing this wearables brings me to this conclusion:\n\n*   Most of this wearables are not unisex, which is problem (1)\n*   Most of this wearables have very simple color textures which cause them to look very simple, (2)\n*   There are 5 categories that doesn't have any standard wearables at all, (3)\n*   No new wearables were added throughout whole year (4)\n\nThis four problems brings us to more important issues:\n\n*   lack of individuality (which is very important in the metaverse)\n*   lack of interest to standard wearables (do you ever see someone from regular players worn standard wearables or combine them with wearables from marketplace?)\n*   lack of motivation to for monthly comeback into metaverse\n*   newcomers looks exactly the same\n*   maybe if we will deep dive more into analysis we will find more issues\n\nThis is the main problems that i want to resolve, and thats why i've come to DAO for grant.\n\nHere is list of solutions that i want to provide throughout long-term production (6-12 months):\n\n*   1 monthly pack of casual wearables with unique style that will include models for all categories listed above, wearables\n*   1 monthly pack of thematical wearables (for example: cyberpunk theme), that will include models for all categories listed above and for each seasonal month (october - halloween, december - xmas, february - valentines, april - easter, pride parade, summer pool party, etc)\n*   (monthly) several amount of wearables that will have different body shapes (example: shorts with thick legs, sweater with thick body, thick bodysuit (upper_body + lower_body as upper_body slot) the same with thin or different shaped bodies (apple, pear, rectangle, hourglass, etc body shapes)\n    total: 3 monthly packs (casual, thematical, and additional)\n\nAdditionally:\n\n*   update models and textures for all current wearables (except hairs, looks like they're good), saving original look and idea, but improving model details and textures to be more HQ\n*   adapt all current wearable models to be unisex\n*   update of facial_hair models (currently they're flat), adding more small details to make them look more HQ\n*   dcl wearables (non brand) thats done for free giveaways at MVFW, MVMF, Pride Parade, Art Week , all have different quality and style (and mostly, they're very boring) and i want to change this situation. I want to provide more detailed and more HQ wearables with detailed concepts.\n\nThis is the current plan for next 6 months, that as i think will increase standard wearables amount, improve their quality, provide more options, increase individuality, brings motivation for people to come back any time.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nApril 2023: (month of voting)\nIn the time of voting for grant\n\n1.  updating and adapting current wearable models and textures, making them to be unisex (i will publish update and will wait for feedback in comments)\n2.  2D artist will prepare first concept for monthly packs (casual) and (i will publish update and will wait for feedback in comments)\n3.  starting of doing casual wearables for monthly pack, according to concepts provided by 2D artist\n    once everything is good and reques for grant t is accepted, here is the roadmap for next months:\n\nMay 2023 (1 month)\n\n1.  2D artist will prepare three new conepts (casual, thematical, additional) (update on the first week or two)\n2.  3D artist will begin work on 3D models and there will be update at the end of month with all wearables, or time at time once each piece of wearables will be done.\n3.  meanwhile 2D artist will prepare concepts for next months to avoid risks of passed deadlines for 3D artist\n\nAnd this plan will keep going for the next 5 months. I want to notice that people will be able to see concepts and decide if somethings needs to be changed completely or if it's good to go.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

(Imagine that with this feature your character actually can use rollers animation with rollers wearables, or avatar even can float on ground instead of running with feets, this is perfect solution for wearables like wings / hoverboards from BTTF(Back to the Future)!!!)\n\nTo make this happen, this things needs to be done:\n\n1.  Add stand, walk, run categories to be chosen while publishing emotes in builder\n2.  Add option to select emotes from new categories and button that will let us use them as default emotes for (stand, walk, run)\n3.  Add limitation info to docs (for example, this emotes always should be looped and have short animation (15-30 frames for example)\n\n*   All range / height limitations should stay same as current cylinder limitations for emotes in builder\n*   Animations that use some scale for bones should not be approved (this probably will cause some issues?)\n*   Animations should not exploit/go underground\n\nLooks like this is all that i wanted to say\" idea itself seems fine for me and don't see any issues with that, this emotes don't affect anyhow to any experiences aka scene mechanics\n\nBest regards, theankou!\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x059d0025e4e1bb1a37f2c922e54b139bc1231ee0 (DecentraLend)\n\nCreating an Organizational Chart for Decentraland\n\nIntroduction:\nDecentraland is a decentralized virtual world where users can own, build, and monetize their own virtual reality experiences. As a decentralized platform, Decentraland is governed by a community of developers, designers, and investors who collaborate to build and enhance the platform. However, as the platform grows and evolves, it becomes increasingly important to establish more transparency and accountability to ensure that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities of the individuals and teams involved in its development.\n\nPurpose:\nThe purpose of this proposal is to suggest that Decentraland create an organizational chart that outlines the various departments, roles, and responsibilities of the teams involved in its development. This will increase transparency and accountability, and provide a better understanding of the platform's governance structure.\n\nBenefits:\nBy creating an organizational chart, Decentraland can achieve the following benefits:\n\nImproved Transparency: An organizational chart will provide a clear overview of the platform's governance structure, making it easier for community members to understand who is responsible for what.\n\nEnhanced Collaboration: A clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities of each team member will facilitate better collaboration between teams, leading to more efficient decision-making and smoother execution of projects.\n\nBetter Accountability: An organizational chart will make it easier to identify who is responsible for a particular task or decision, enabling better accountability across the organization.\n\nImproved Communication: A clear overview of the platform's governance structure will facilitate better communication between team members, as well as with the broader Decentraland community.\n\nProposal Details:\nThe proposed organizational chart for Decentraland should include the following elements:\n\nDepartments: The chart should outline the various departments involved in the development of Decentraland, such as product development, marketing, community management, etc.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities: Each department should have a clear list of roles and responsibilities associated with it, outlining the key functions and activities performed by each team member.\n\nReporting Structure: The chart should outline the reporting structure within each department, highlighting who reports to whom and who is responsible for key decision-making.\n\nClear Ownership: The chart should clearly outline who owns each aspect of the platform's development, ensuring that all stakeholders understand who is responsible for each area of the platform.\n\nConclusion:\nCreating an organizational chart for Decentraland is an important step in increasing transparency, enhancing collaboration, and improving accountability within the organization. By outlining the roles and responsibilities of each team member, Decentraland can ensure that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the platform's governance structure, leading to more efficient decision-making, smoother execution of projects, and better communication between team members and the broader community.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Scalability Upgrade for Decentraland: Implementing Rollup Solutions",
    "body": "> by 0x4ec0bcf5e3bd218381acf3c889919bc4ef12febd (LF)\n\nShould the following $160,000 grant in the Core Unit category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to secure a grant from the Decentraland DAO to implement rollup solutions, a scalability upgrade. The project will be divided into three stages, with a budget of $160,000 for each stage. The implementation of rollups will significantly reduce gas fees and transaction speeds, improving the user experience. The proposed project is a cost-effective and efficient solution that will keep the platform competitive and benefit the entire community. We believe that implementing rollups is a crucial step in the development of the platform and hope to collaborate with the Decentraland DAO to bring this upgrade to fruition.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n160,000 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4ec0bCF5E3bD218381acf3C889919Bc4Ef12fEBd\n\n## Email address\n\nluistheboss3@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nWe are writing to submit a proposal for implementing rollups on Decentraland. As you know, Decentraland is one of the leading metaverse platforms, offering users a unique and immersive virtual world experience. However, the platform is currently facing scalability issues, which limit its potential for growth and adoption. We propose that implementing rollups is the best path forward for solving these scalability issues.\n\nStage 1: Development\n\nIn this stage, the rollup solution will be designed and developed. We estimate that this stage will take around 3-6 months, depending on the specific requirements of the project. The proposed budget for this stage is $160,000, which will cover the cost of experienced developers, conducting design and development work, and performing initial testing to ensure that the solution meets the necessary standards of security and performance.\n\nStage 2: Testing and Deployment\n\nIn this stage, the rollup solution will be thoroughly tested to ensure its security, performance, and compatibility with the Decentraland platform. The proposed budget for this stage is also $160,000, which will cover the cost of testing and deployment, including bug fixes, security audits, and other necessary work to ensure the successful launch of the rollup solution.\n\nStage 3: Maintenance and Upgrades\n\nOnce the rollup solution is deployed, it will need to be maintained and upgraded as needed to ensure its continued performance and security. This stage will involve ongoing maintenance, upgrades, and support for the rollup solution. The proposed budget for this stage is also $160,000 per year, which will cover the cost of ongoing maintenance and upgrades, as well as any necessary support for users.\n\nOverall Budget\n\nTherefore, the total budget for implementing rollups on Decentraland in these three stages would be $480,000. We understand that this is a significant investment, but we believe that it is necessary to ensure the long-term success of Decentraland and its position as a leading metaverse platform.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe that implementing rollups on Decentraland is a crucial step in the development of the platform, and it will significantly improve the user experience by providing faster and cheaper transactions. Decentraland has the potential to become the leading metaverse platform, but it needs to keep up with the latest technologies and solutions to remain competitive. The proposed rollup solution is a cost-effective and efficient way to achieve this goal, and we are confident that it will benefit the entire Decentraland community. Thank you for considering our proposal.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nStage 1: Design and Development (3 months, $160k)\n\nDesign and develop rollup solution\nConduct internal testing and audit preparation\n\nMilestones:\n\nResearch and analysis of rollup solutions (2 weeks)\nDesign and development of rollup solution (6 weeks)\nInternal testing and audit prep (4 weeks)\n\nStage 2: Testing and Deployment (3 months, $150k)\n\nConduct external testing\nImplement rollup solution on Decentraland mainnet\nDevelop documentation for users\n\nMilestones:\n\nExternal testing (8 weeks)\nImplementation on mainnet (2 weeks)\nDocumentation for users (2 weeks)\nFinal testing and optimization (2 weeks)\n\nStage 3: Maintenance and Upgrades (Ongoing, $160k)\n\nMonitor and maintain rollup solution\nImplement upgrades and provide user support\n\nMilestones:\n\nOngoing maintenance and monitoring\nUpgrades and improvements as needed\nUser support\nTotal Budget: $480,000\n\nThis roadmap outlines a three-stage project to implement rollup solutions on Decentraland's platform, significantly improving the user experience. Each stage has a budget of $160,000 with clear milestones for progress and accountability. This project will keep Decentraland competitive by reducing gas fees and transaction times, benefitting the entire community.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xef50b5b77b9469fd171ee3a3fa375c303af51031 (Demid)\n\nThis poll aims to improve the [Decentraland Documentation](https://docs.decentraland.org/).\n\nWe are reaching out to you today to gather your thoughts and opinions on the possibility of adding support for other languages to the Decentraland documentation website.\n\nAs you know, Decentraland is the first decetralized metaverse with a diverse community of users from many different countries and cultures. Currently, the documentation website is only available in English, which may make it difficult for some members of our community to fully engage with the platform and its features.\n\nI believe that adding support for other languages to the documentation website could help to make Decentraland more accessible and inclusive for all members of our community.\n\nI would like to hear your thoughts on how this could be achieved. Some possible options include:\n\n1.  Implementing a crowdsourcing system where members of the community can contribute translations for the website\n2.  Hiring professional translators to translate the entire documentation website into different languages\n3.  Providing machine translation services to automatically translate the website into different languages\n\nIn my opinion, the most effective way would be to create a crowdsourcing system where community members could contribute translations for the website, because no one knows the Decentraland better than Decentraland users. For example, these can be commits to a [repository](https://github.com/decentraland/documentation) on GitHub.\n\nPlease share your thoughts and opinions on these options, or any other ideas you may have.\n\n**VOTING OPTIONS**\n\n**Yes**: I support this idea. Let’s hold a community discussion and reach consensus on translate Decentraland Documentation\n\n**No**: I believe that the English is enough\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

While I've been playing games in DCL since my first day at WonderMine I didn't start writing about Decentraland gaming until June 2022.\n\nThe growth Decentraland gaming has had in the 1.5~ years I've been here has been exponential. Where some people look and can't see past \"Playstation One graphics\" I just see the infinite potential.\n\nEvery single time I get to do something in Decentraland I couldn't do before I can't help myself but tell everyone who will listen. If I had infinite money I wouldn't ask for this grant, helping creators find an audience has been the thing that brings me the most joy over the last year and I would happily write and tweet about the people working to make Decentraland a more fun experience for free.\n\nSome writing examples include:\n\nhttps://www.jar0d.com/post/nikki-fuego-coming-in-hot\n\nhttps://www.jar0d.com/post/decentralizing-community\n\nhttps://www.jar0d.com/post/intro-p2e-gaming\n\nhttps://www.playdcl.games/post/the-metaverse-just-got-a-lot-bigger\n\nhttps://www.playdcl.games/post/top-5-mythic-items-in-decentraland\n\nhttps://www.playdcl.games/post/ice-poker-a-huge-change\n\nhttps://www.playdcl.games/post/who-is-the-best-gamer-in-decentraland\n\nAudience:\nMy Twitter following has been around 3,000 users until recently when someone purchased approximately 60k followers for me. I am currently in the process of requesting that Twitter removes them. Luckily, I have access to historical data for reference.\n\nEngagement metrics:\nOver the 91 days before someone purchased me fake engagement, Nov 23rd - Feb 21st, I had\n\\- 406.6k Impressions (4.5k/day)\n\\- 5.6% avg Engagement Rate\n\\- 979 Link clicks (11/day)\n\\- 513 Retweets without comments (6/day)\n\\- 7.1k Likes (78/day)\n\\- 2.2k Replies (24/day)\n\nMy average tweet count was pretty low over this window; I feel confident that with this grant and the ability to focus 100%, I can maintain or improve all metrics.\n\nPerformance Metrics:\n\\- 25-35 Blog Posts\n\\- 270 Tweets (not including replies or engaging with the DCL community on their posts)\n\\- Average 150-250k~ Twitter impressions a month\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWeekly Deliverables\n\nArticles: 1-3\nWords: 3-3.5k\nTweets: 21~\nImpressions: 37,500-55,000\nEngagement Rate: 5%+\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "[Resubmission] Dark Dungeons",
    "body": "> by 0x2e09a10eaace1ef3a66fbf6f1f782c8c0cb8c942 (Soulsinger)\n\nShould the following $47,500 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\n**Dark Dungeons** is a game similar to **Dungeons and Dragons** played worldwide by an enormous range of players. And it is no less intriguing to watch others play, as evidenced by the great success of organisations such as Critical Role. We believe a good implementation of this concept has the power to introduce many new users to Decentraland!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n47,500 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n8 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2e09A10eaAcE1Ef3a66FbF6F1F782C8c0cb8c942\n\n## Email address\n\ncenmodelscontact@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n### Original proposal\n\nhttps://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-3a70282-dark-dungeons-game/18230\n\n### Changes in resubmission\n\n● **Budget: 54 000$ -> 47 500$**\n\n● **Land Rental: 2000$ -> 500$**\n\n● **Locations: 10 -> 8**\n\n● **LAND: 2x3 -> 1x1**\n\n### Goal\n\nThe main goal in creating this game is to expand the user base of Decentraland and showcase it as a place to have fun! Decentraland has many casinos and other establishments that require financial investments from players. Thus, for an ordinary user Decentraland looks like a place where everyone wants to get money from you - but it is and can be much more than that!\n\n[Demo](https://dark-dungeons.herokuapp.com)\n\n[Proposal Demo](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-de7fa02-dungeons-and-dragons-decentraland-demo/15603)\n\n[Discord Demo](https://discord.com/channels/894658869391933540/1027268770923827320)\n\n[CEN Discord](https://discord.gg/U3w9CZRg)\n\nWe believe the main thing missing in Decentraland is the reasons for an ordinary user rather than an investor to join Decentraland. The main goal of our game is to become such a reason and thereby attract a large number of new users to Decentraland.\n\nThe game we want to create will be inspired by Dungeons and Dragons but won’t be its copy. We plan to fill the game with popular memes and other humorous content. There will also be cameos with famous pop culture characters. We decided to simplify some mechanics so that the game fits better into Decentraland and is easy to understand for all users regardless of their experience.\n\n### Scope\n\nThe scope of this grant proposal is ~8 months, until about the end of September 2023. Our goal is to release a game in several steps until we have, by the end of this time, a fully working v1 of our game accessible to all Decentraland users.\n\n### Game mechanics\n\nAs we mentioned, we decided to build a roleplaying experience specific to Decentraland. Some of those modifications are:\n\n● A session in D\\&D lasts, on average, 2-3 hours; in our game, we want to reduce the time of one session to 15-20 minutes.\n\n● An AI (Artificial Intelligence) will perform the role of the gamemaster (host). Players will have a limited number of action options in a given situation.\n\n### How we see the final result:\n\n1.  1-4 players in total in one session.\n2.  Each character has characteristics (strength, charisma, etc.), specific items\n    in the inventory (crossbow, potion, etc.), and other differences.\n3.  The characters find themselves in a situation where they need to solve a problem or\n    receive a task from a non-player character in the story. (We expect that the comicality of some situations and the integration of memes and pop culture characters will have a positive impact on marketing.)\n\nFor example, a simple scenario might be that players start their journey in a tavern, and they need to find a villager-werewolf.\n\nThe main gameplay will lay in the fact that players will choose options for actions, such as: \"Inspect the tavern,\" or \"Start talking to the quiet villager”\n\nIn total, the player will change up to 4 locations during the game. The game ends when the players have completed the task, failed it, or when all the players’ characters have died.\n\nDue to the variability, the game has great replay value. Play as another character, take other companions to your team, and the game outcome will be completely different. We also plan to release new scripts regularly.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Estimated Timeline:** 8 months\n\n**2023 Q2:**\n\n\\-Prototypes of the main game mechanics (action selection, dice roll, etc.)\n\n\\-Adventure scenarios and building the world\n\n\\-Concepts of characters, locations, items\n\n\\-Rough 3D models (characters, objects, etc.)\n\n***Main goal:*** Alpha version of the game on testnet\n\n**2023 Q3:**\n\n\\-Development of all game mechanics based on Alpha feedback\n\n\\-All 3D models (scenery, effects, etc.)\n\n\\-Images (player cards, location backgrounds, etc.)\n\n\\-Audio (sounds of objects, etc.)\n\n***Main goal:*** Beta version of the game in Decentraland\n\n**2023 Q4:**\n\n\\-Collect feedback from beta version users\n\n\\-Implement remaining features and polish the game experience\n\n\\-Marketing (payment to Twitch and YouTube channels, inviting famous bloggers to play our game)\n\n***Main goal:*** V1 Live\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Process for Establishing Formal Working Groups",
    "body": "> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Process for Establishing Formal Working Groups](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e47386c0-9ee1-11ed-868f-0d503a0e5b7e)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal outlines the purpose and process for establishing formal DAO Working Groups.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nWorking Groups allow engaged members of the DCL community to collaborate and ultimately solve for the problems and opportunities identified in Pre-Proposal Polls. This proposal aims to formalize the process of creating community-led working groups following the passage of a \"pre-proposal poll\" and leading to the submission of a well-thought-out and socialized governance proposal.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n[The DAO Governance Proposal Stages](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5193f850-5c00-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174) outlined three distinct stages for identifying community stakeholder interests, socializing solutions, and developing a well-thought-out and implementable governance outcome. In many cases, however, this is not a seamless process, and the building of community consensus and researching impacts and implementation paths require coordination and collaboration across various distributed points of the Decentraland Community.\n\nGovernance as voting further has potential to create divisive community and political dynamics. First past the poll voting in particular can promote polarization and zero-sum engagements. Working within the constraints of our established governance process, it is thus extremely important to have a robust and participatory \"decision-making process\" such that the votes we table are representative to the greatest extent possible.\n\nWorking groups - \"a group of people who investigate a particular problem and suggest ways of dealing with it (Merriam-Webster, 2022)\" - aim to provide opportunities for community members to engage in productive discourse, and complex decision-making. Working groups also provide a forum for the support and engagement of experienced governance facilitators and other community stakeholders to help direct the group toward identifying and articulating a solution or set of potential solutions for broader community consideration.\n\nFormalizing procedures for establishing and conducting working groups will create a transparent, consistent, and efficient model for moving from the identification of an issue toward the best effort at its resolution. This approach will be one way to tackle and escalate different issues toward concrete outcomes, but it will not become the exclusive one, since each community member will still have the possibility to adopt or choose other ways to channel their needs, discussions or concerns.\n\nThe proposed Decentraland DAO Working Group process is based on an adaptation of the Delphi Method. [The Delphi Method](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/management/the-delphi-method) is a research and decision-making methodology used to gather insights and opinions from a variety of experts and stakeholders, and is particularly well suited for distributed and decentralized contexts. The objective of the Delphi method is to generate consensus, and draw from our “collective wisdom” to inform our decision making process.\n\nDuring active working groups, the DAO Facilitation Squad (or a representative from the working group) will share the status and stages of each active working group as a part of the regular agenda of bi-weekly Town Halls.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nDecentraland DAO Working Groups will be carried out  in the following steps:\n\n1.  **Successful Pre-Proposal Poll** - Proposal passes the initial stage of the governance process, signaling sufficient community support for the allocation of DAO/Community time and resources for active facilitation.\n\n2.  **Working Group Formation** - Working groups can be formed through the promotion of a Pre-Proposal Poll or a Draft Proposal to a Working Group by the author or a contributor to the poll. If the proposal is not promoted to the next stage or to a Working Group by its author or contributors in the term of 30 days, every community member will be enabled to promote it to a Working Group. A working group, however, is in no way a prerequisite for an initiative to move forward through the governance process, and pre-proposal Polls can be escalated to a Draft Proposal without a Working Group.  (See Figure 1 & Figure 2 in Comments below)\n\n3.  **Distributed Delphi-Informed Method** - The Delphi Method is a structured process for obtaining expert/stakeholder opinions on a particular topic, in order to gather input and reach consensus on a particular topic. It typically involves several rounds of questionnaires or surveys, with each round building on the results of the previous round. The Delphi Method is useful for decision-making in a DAO as it allows for collection of diverse perspectives. Decentraland DAO’s Distributed Delphi Method includes the following steps:\n\n*   (3.1) **Facilitator Selection** - Proposal author/contributors self-select or appoint a representative to facilitate the working group. See Annex A for the full role and responsibilities of the Working Group Facilitator. Unless specifically requested to abstain, a member of the DAO Facilitation Team will support the Working Group Facilitator(s), and may be selected by proposal authors to serve as the Working Group’s primary facilitator. If the designated Working Group Facilitator quits at any stage, a DAO Facilitator or a DAO Committee Member will fulfill the role and decide with involved community members if the working group should remain active.\n\n*   (3.2) **Call for Working Group Participants** - A general call for Working Group participants will be issued via Discord, DCL DAO Twitter, and pathways for joining will be established, likely including integration with the Governance dApp from the Pre-Proposal Poll. (See Figure 3 in Comments below)\n\n*   (3.3) **Pose question or problem to the Working Group** - The Working Group Facilitator will design and distribute the question(s) / problem to the group, for participants to respond to. This can be in the form of a single question, questionnaire, or survey.\n\n*   (3.4) **Solutioning** - Participants submit their proposed solutions/responses in the form of written comments, open-ended questions, or other form as specified in the questionnaire/survey.\n\n*   (3.5) **Analysis and Reporting** - The proposed solutions/responses are analyzed, grouped into categories and/or themes, summarized and shared by the working group Facilitator(s).\n\n(Continued in \"Impacts\" Section Below)\n\n\n## Impacts\n\n(Continued from Above)\n\n*   (3.6) **Solutioning (II)** - A second round of clarifying questions is posed by the Working Group Facilitator. Members of the Working Group then have the opportunity to revise and tailor their responses, based on the summary of themes and categories, and adapted questions, repeating the process until a consensus is reached or a set of multiple potential pathways forward is developed - as determined by the Working Group Facilitator. In the interest of time, this process should not be repeated more than four times. (See Figure 4 in Comments below)\n\n4.  **Working Group Synopsis Report & Round Table Discussion** - The DAO Facilitation Team will lead, or support the drafting of a Working Group Synopsis Report, detailing outcomes of the Working Group. The Facilitator of the Working Group, however, is ultimately responsible for ensuring this artifact is delivered. This report will serve as a record of the proceedings, and as a point of reference for future discussions and drafting of proposals around the issue. The report will be publicly shared and discussed in a Round Table format, including Working Group Facilitators and Participants.\n\n5.  **Draft Proposal** -  A proposal that has passed the Pre-Proposal Stage and workshopped via the Working Group, may be published as a Draft Proposal by the original proposals Authors or Contributors. Once again, a working group is not a prerequisite for a Draft Proposal.\n\n*   (5.1) **Proposal Feedback & Review** - Proposal authors may share the Draft Proposal for review and feedback with the wider community in general, and Working Group Participants in particular, to ensure it is representative of Working Group outputs.\n\n**IMPACTS**\n\nThe most significant impact of the Working Group process is that it will begin to decentralize the process of facilitating DAO decision-making, providing community members with structured tools to engage multiple stakeholders in a group decision-making and solutioning process. The outcome of this should be two fold. First, it will create more opportunities for consensus building, potentially reducing polarization within the DAO. Second, it will support more frequent emergence of well-thought out, socialized and workshopped governance proposals, in which the long term impacts and implementation pathways of the policy decision have been explored in depth.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe DAO Facilitation Squad has been working with the dApps Governance Squad to develop an integration of the working group process into our governance portal. Initial wire frames of the UI/UX are included in the comments section below.\n\n***ALL IMAGES AND WIREFRAMES DISPLAYED IN THIS PROPOSAL ARE JUST PROOFS OF CONCEPT AND GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR IMPLEMENTATION IN THE GOVERNANCE PORTAL.***\n\nIn the interim period between when this pathway becomes live in the governance dApp, the Facilitation Squad will use a notion workspace to support the working group process.\n\nThe Working Group Pathway in the governance dApp will serve primarily as a central dashboard for the working group. Collaborative work must be carried out through external platforms, such as notion, google, or others, which will be determined by the working group's specific facilitator. In the future, a grant or portion of the Facilitation Squad's operating budget could be allocated to integrate a tool specifically design for this process, that connects to the Working Group Dashboard in our dApp.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll Working Group procedures and outputs are non-binding. Working Groups aim to expand our governance from a process of voting to one of decision-making. The formalization of this process with clear pathways for the collection and synthesis of information will assist us in devising well thought out and implementable governance policies. The Facilitation Squad has worked closely with the dApps team to develop sound implementation pathways, and once activated within our dApp, the working group feature should significantly increase our ability to engage in distributed decision-making, rather than simply voting on distributed decisions.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x7a582b51f09bafbb8fa5d02fb1e033d80bcbbe7c (MetaverseCAC)\n\nShould the following $36,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nHello, as the Metaverse Chief Architects Community team, we have been creating various projects for the Decentraland platform for 2 years and we continue to do so. Our team consists of professional architects, interior designers, designers, and programmers. We have provided services to many different corporate firms in different countries around the world, and we have convinced many companies to create a project on the Decentraland platform. So far, we have been involved in 100 different projects and we have realized all of them on the Decentraland platform. You can visit our website to see our projects: www.metaversecac.com.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n36,000 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x7aeb6d88251f12f5e4316f23f89bfbcdf442baf4\n\n## Email address\n\ninfo@metaversecac.com\n\n## Description\n\nWhile designing the projects, we noticed that the Genesis City map was published in a very complex way. There are attached buildings and it is impossible to pass through these buildings. We detected many circulation errors within the map. Avatars can get stuck between buildings while passing through. These bugs can cause players to get bored and leave the game or decrease their time spent in the game. We have found a solution to this problem.\n\nWe want to reshape the genesis map with professional architects in our team and an urban planner to include in our team. The most important factor we will consider when replanning the map is that the map is in a comfortable circulation. In this way, avatars will be able to navigate freely between the plots and we will avoid many bugs. There are 3 different maps that we are currently planning. All three maps have different advantages within themselves. Instead of a plain standard and boring map, making a map where many different experiences can turn into an advantage will also excite the landowners. so we can stand out more than other metaverse platforms and open up existing lands to new customers. We can publish the maps we have designed after receiving the payment, and then start voting for the maps. so that the map with the most votes can be started to be published. We will make a fun, trouble-free map that will excite the players, increase circulation.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n1.  Month\n\n• All the problems of the current map will be analyzed.\n\n• The problems found will be listed in order.\n\n• Solutions will be sought on the problems found.\n\n• The solutions found will be listed and work will be started.\n\n• The Genesis map will be redesigned with minimal changes.\n\n2.  Month\n\n• A map will be designed as an alternative to the Genesis map.\n\n• The map will be designed very differently from the physical world.\n\n• Black holes will be added at some points of the map. (Details will be shared after the grant is approved.)\n\n• All the technical drawings of the map will be completed and shared with the Technical team in the form of a dwg file.\n\n3.  Month\n\n• A new map will be designed using architectural techniques.\n\n• The map will technically have a design similar to the city of barcelona.\n\n• It will look very neat in the bird's eye view\n\n• Different experiences will be available within each divided area.\n\n• It will arouse curiosity in the players.\n\nYou will be able to follow all the progress on our website. www.metaversecac.com\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xb89ba583541aeba63b8553d512af24d4b4aa1373 (Swordpony)\n\nShould the following $20,000 grant in the Sponsorship category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe're organizing the Bridg3 metaverse hackathon in Finland to help thousands of students learn what the Metaverse could mean for their future, and start building their own future. Students would love to have a dedicated Decentraland challenge encouraging them to build an open-source, virtual 3D University Campus to simulate how the future of learning could be done in the Metaverse. Transforming the entire learning experience.\n\nThe Good Cartel is the leading Web3 educator in Finland providing a free Web3 Masterclass with credit points. With thousands of students enrolled, it's now time to give students the tools to start building.  We have experience organizing NASA hackathons so the experience will be top-notch and memorable.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n20,000 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n2 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xB89ba583541aEba63B8553D512af24d4B4AA1373\n\n## Email address\n\nsointu@blocklane.eu\n\n## Description\n\nWe feel Decentraland's mission and open source mentality fit our mission perfectly, providing all students in Finland free access to start testing ideas and building within the Metaverse. It is crucial to have an open platform but also we feel the future of learning should happen in the Metaverse. Current solutions are not open and students cannot build on top of them. We want to enable students to define what, where and how their future learning journeys look like.\n\nDecentraland Worlds Beta seems like a perfect fit for this challenge. Allowing thousands of students in Finland to start creating their own 3D virtual learning space across multiple cities. Connecting campuses and their communities. Have it available at any time for testing ideas and building demos. Yet, as this is a 1-month long hackathon process, we aim for the Virtual Campus to stay open and available for all students even after the hackathon. Giving students the power of defining the future of education but also university researchers a continuous stream of data, ideas and innovation.\n\nDecentraland Worlds Beta will help students interact with each other, even at a distance. It provides instant collaboration opportunities between learners, teachers, researchers, and societal actors. In the future it could even be considered a National Virtual Campus where challenges can be solved together, offering new kinds of opportunities for skills and competence development.\n\nOther hackathon partners include for example the City of Tampere and YLE, The National Broadcasting Company of Finland. Hackathon finals will be held during the Tampere Smart City Week event with a dedicated Metaverse track at the brand-new Nokia Arena. We're expecting 2 800+ guests from over 20+ countries across Europe. Smart City Week audience is not your typical crypto degens but Web2 enterprises and city officials eager to learn what the Metaverse is and could mean for their future. We'll have keynotes like Dr. Marwan Alzarouni, CEO of Dubai Blockchain Center (DBCC) and Marja Konttinen from Decentraland has preliminarily accepted our keynote request to showcase the inspiring Decentraland origin story. Having YLE as a partner will enable free nationwide media coverage to showcase Decentraland Worlds and what the students can build when given free rain and open-source tools. But also act as an inspiration to the Web2 audience.\n\nTampereES is the hackathon co-organizer. Given that they are students, we can make sure their voices are heard and the hackathon is being built by the students for the students. And not aiming for profit but impact and long-lasting results. We believe this will also bring new builders and a ready student community to Decentraland.\n\nThe Hackathon website will be released shortly at bridg3.co.\n\nMore info:\nThe Good Cartel https://www.goodcartel.xyz/\nTampereES https://tamperees.com/\nTampere Smart City Week https://www.tscec.fi/en/\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe've set a clear hackathon timeline that goes like this:\n\n0.  April - Team building support on Discord and IRL matchmaking event. 60 teams minimum participating.\n1.  May 5th - Bridg3 hackathon kick-off revealing challenges and mentors. Keynotes (streamed online) and mentoring (IRL).\n2.  Mentoring continues online on The Good Cartel Discord server.\n3.  May 16 - Mid-way checkpoint. Keynotes (streamed online) and mentoring (IRL).\n4.  May 30-31st - Final check point. Mentoring IRL and pitching training (hybrid).\n5.  June 4th - 6th - Open community voting on the top 10 finalists.\n6.  June 6th - Bridg3 track at Tampere Smart City Week, hackathon finals, announcing the winners and after party\n7.  Hackathon solutions can and will be open and developed further with the help of mentors\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

I would like to design a course ENTIRELY about business opportunities in Decentraland. Not just theory or generic advice or promotional fluff, but actual activities (supported by theory) and outcomes (required for course completion) with video from Decentraland. I would add this to my course lists and publish it online at LinkedIn Learning or Coursera.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n15,000 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n3 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x9DE97E69a174d44686C97727431478bD4480f7E4\n\n## Email address\n\nted@tedladd.com\n\n## Description\n\nIn my courses on Next Generation Business Models and Multi-sided Platform Marketplaces, I include a session about Web3. It is not (yet) compelling because metaverses looks too much like a poorly animated children's game. Ironically, the only way to have business professionals (outside of experimental brand managers at luxury clothing makers) take virtual worlds seriously is to convince them of the opportunities such that their company engages. \"Ironic\" because this is becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. If convince them, they join, and then consumers engage. (This is called the indirect network effect of a multi-sided platform.)\n\nMy course would discuss (and require students and execs to engage in) avatars, scavenger hunts to diverse, global branded locations, valuation of MANA currency and DecentraLand real estate, business fundamentals of blockchain and smart contracts, potential uses for AI in virtual world (now bots, but soon customer-product fit), B2B opportunities, B2Employee experiences, and the new meanings of diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging in virtual worlds.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nI am already scheduled to deliver a full course for Hult in late June on \"Business Opportunities in Web3\", and already scheduled to include this topic in one session for my summer course at Harvard on Next Generation Business Models. So it must be completed by then!!!\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Our mission is to keep generating digital wearables so that Decentraland players can enjoy beautiful and unique wearables that we will continuously be creating.\n\nAvant Garde is increasing partnerships with various artists and fashion brands to generate more digital wearables to present more variations of wearable items. We hope Decentraland will become our main stage for releasing upcoming collections as well.\n\nWe will never stop until people can fully express themselves in metaverse games.

We have already developed a successful season 1 game (9th of January 2023 and will end on 6 of March 2023), \"UFO Attack\".\n\nPlay Link: https://play.decentraland.org/?position=36%2C8\n\nGameplay link: https://vimeo.com/803474514/51281c0503\n\nThe season 1 last for 8 weeks, during that time we achieved:\n\n*   Over 1200+ unique players\n*   170K+ games played\n*   AVG session time of over 48 minutes\n*   100+ unique inland MANA purchases\n\nWe are sure that our project aligns with the goals Decentraland.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n25,000 USD\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n4 months\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe17AeaFd1d18B455232c92B77B03D042E1877e12\n\n## Email address\n\ncontact@tarkinstudios.com\n\n## Description\n\nPlayVerse is a place where users can discover the metaverse in a fun and engaging way through free-to-play games. Our platform not only offers enjoyable experiences that allow players to interact with others, but also serves as an introduction to the world of NFTs and the limitless possibilities of virtual reality. Right now, users join us and explore this new era of gaming, while earning a variety of prizes and wearables.\n\nAt PlayVerse we believe that our project aligns with the goals of Decentraland, which is to promote innovation and create new opportunities for the Decentraland community. We are excited about the potential of our project and the impact we are having on the Decentraland platform.\n\nBack in 2021 PlayVerse started with the mission to transform users into passionate gamers in Decentraland. We purchased a land and began studying on how to create our own vision of the Metaverse, and deploy incredible experiences for the Decentraland community. Then, in 2022, we launched our successful \"UFO Attack\" game very much aligned with Decentraland's vision of the metaverse, and our community quickly grew.\n\nGoals already Achieved:\n\n*   Top 5 most video game plays in DCL\n*   Top 3 most spent time inland in DCL\n*   Top 3 average time per session in DCL\n*   Top 5 land entries in DCL\n*   Top 5 most visited land in DCL\n*   Over 1200+ unique players\n*   170K+ games played\n*   AVG session time of over 48 minutes\n*   Growing social media communities (Twitter, Discord, Twitch, etc.)\n*   Revenue has been generated each month from in-game purchases, wearable royalties\n*   NFT prices up to 500 MANA at marketplace.\n*   Fully integrated NFT-based wearables with functionality.\n*   Released the PlayVerse Games NFT collection\n*   Released 8 NFT alien body parts (4 mythic & 4 unique)\n*   Super PlayVerse cape\n*   Farming game experience\n*   In-game leaderboards\n*   Multi-user lobby experience\n*   Easy-to-use UI\n*   Fun gaming quiz games with rewards\n*   Unique NFT in game utilities\n*   Back-end/server infrastructure for performance and better internal testing.\n    \\*Source: https://dcl-metrics.com/\n\nWe created this content with, hard work, and dedication, without any grant, only using our limited resources.\n\nOur vision for following seasons is to introduce new multiplayer mechanics, new categories of challenges, and more NFT prizes to incentivize the DCL community. With this grant, we aim to invest in developing the next season's games, improving our infrastructure, and expanding our team to provide even better gaming experiences for the community.\n\nWith this grant, we aim to invest in developing our season 2, improving our infrastructure, and expanding our team to provide even better gaming experiences including mechanics, new categories of challenges, and more NFT prizes to incentivize the actual community, and bring new players into DCL.\n\n**Seasson 2 Game**\n\nKingKong Stack (an adapted 3D version of the popular game Stacker) will introduce a totally new and fun game experience never seen before in Decentraland, easy to play, difficult to master.\n\nThe game will consist of 3x3 blocks that will be constantly moving side to side on top of a 3x3 block base. Moving direction will be determined by the user approach to the block's base. The aim is to pile the blocks on top of each other as high as possible, trying to reach the highest level to achieve the highest possible score. The score will be determined not only by the height of the tower, but also by the amount of blocks left when reaching the top.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMilestones\n\n*   Redesign the lobby and land experience.\n*   Acquire sponsorship agreements with brands.\n*   Listen and work on new game plays proposed by the community.\n*   Increase the brand name by getting a 300% increase in visits to the land, as well as the game time.\n*   Launch the KingKong Stack game, with fully functional gameplay mechanics and scoring system.\n*   Implement NFT rewards for top leaderboard\n*   Develop a system for players to unlock unique experiences and rewards in upcoming seasons by wearing and using previous season wearables.\n*   Conduct ongoing community engagement, including social media promotion, Discord support, and live events.\n*   Achieve a minimum of 4-star rating on DappRadar and other Decentraland review platforms.\n*   Seek partnerships with other Decentraland developers and projects to expand the PlayVerse brand and offerings.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x0636211443e91468ee3657e1d7faede7059c4843 (Nathan)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should Grant Request Proposals require at least 100 VP to submit?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b182b570-bcd6-11ed-8c13-518b5c1940be)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis Draft Proposal aims to add a 100 VP requirement for Grant Request submissions.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nGrants Program :\n\nThe Decentraland DAO possesses a MANA fund that has been set aside to help sponsor and facilitate the continual growth of the Decentraland platform. One avenue used by the DAO to achieve these goals is a Grants Program that was voted in place by the community.\n\nThis Grants Program allows any member of the community to request funding to help reimburse their efforts in community building and education, creating 3D content for the world, or implementing new features and improvements to the platform.\n\nGrants can be requested by completing a Proposal form within the DAO. If approved by the community, then the DAO Committee will execute the transfer of funds to the grant beneficiary by means of a one-time transfer, or a vesting contract.\n\nVP :\n\nVoting Power is represented as “VP”. MANA, LAND, NAMEs & (𝘴𝘦𝘭𝘦𝘤𝘵) L1 Wearables contribute to your total Voting Power as follows:\n\n*   1 MANA contributes 1 VP\n*   1 NAME contributes 100 VP\n*   1 LAND parcel contributes 2000 VP\n*   Wearable rarity ; Uncommon: 1 VP, Rare: 5 VP, Epic: 10 VP, Legendary: 100 VP, Mythic: 1000 VP\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, any wallet can request up to $240,000 from the Decentraland DAO with zero investment in the platform. A VP requirement may reduce 'opportunistic' Grant Requests and help alleviate voter fatigue.\n\nA 100 VP requirement would disincentive Grant Requests being submitted by bots or users who have no real stake in Decentraland. Also, it could help encourage participation in the DAO by setting a minimum level of engagement that must be met before a Grant can be requested.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nA 100 VP requirement, same as Pre-Proposal Polls, would be added to Grant Requests.\n\nThis will be informed to users on the Governance dApp - 'This action requires at least 100 VP. Buy MANA to get VP, or run for delegation.'\n\n\\*100 VP is a roughly $60 investment (current rate), of which could also be acquired through delegation.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA 100 VP requirement for Grant Requests intends to prevent bot submissions and ensure users have 'skin in the game'.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Implement a formal pathway for the DAO to issue a “request for information” (RFI) from the Decentraland Foundation.\n\n2.  Facilitate Decentraland Foundation response to Binding Governance Proposals for feature requests, in the interim period until a Feature Request Category can be formally approved and integrated into the DAO’s governance dApp.\n\nThe first objective is a new initiative. The second builds on a clause included in the recently passed Governance Proposal delegating responsibility for determining and implementing the Reference Client Roadmap to the Decentraland Foundation\n\n**Background**\n\nDecentraland is a progressively decentralizing ecosystem, managed by two core stakeholders: the Decentraland DAO and the Decentraland Foundation. While both of these entities are themselves made up of a diverse and multi-interested group of stakeholders, a cooperative and structured institutional relationship between the DAO and the Foundation is beneficial, if not necessary to the success of our metaversal “way of life.”\n\nThe most important proposal to date outlining a formal relationship between the DAO and the Foundation was recently passed as a Binding Governance Proposal, delegating responsibility for determining and implementing the [“reference client roadmap”](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=38cf5bb0-c322-11eb-ac84-1705d1ae4a66) to the Decentraland Foundation.”\n\nIn the reference client proposal, the Decentraland Foundation notes two key points:\n\nFirst, “The DAO will have a clear path to contribute ideas and requests to the roadmap. This could take the form of a new polling category within the DAO, specific to client feature requests and suggestions. These proposals could then be voted on by the community, with accepted suggestions being passed to the Foundation for inclusion in the next iteration of the product roadmap.”\n\nSecond, “The project is currently in a state of asymmetry in terms of context/resources/contributions between the Foundation and the community.”\n\nThe specification below addresses each point.\n\n**Specification**\n\nIn the context of these points above, this proposal calls for the following, which if supported by the Decentraland Community, will be explored in more detail and outlined further in a Draft Proposal:\n\n1.  Establish a formal pathway for the DAO to issue a “Request for Information” (RFI) from the Decentraland Foundation via the DAO’s governance dApp. A DAO RFI can be on any topic of interest or concern, and if passed, will require a formal statement of response from the Decentraland Foundation. While any response to an RFI will most likely be non-binding, this is an important mechanism for the DAO to communicate its interests and alleviate information “asymmetry” between the Foundation and the Community.\n\n2.  In the interim period between now and when a formal feature request pathway is approved and implemented in the governance dApp, this proposal calls on the Decentraland Foundation to issue a response to a Binding Governance Proposal feature request, indicating a timeline for their implementation of the feature, either integrating it into the existing product roadmap, or including it in the next iteration of the product roadmap - *as stated in the Governance Proposal delegating client roadmap responsibility to the Foundation*. This is a stop gap measure to ensure that the community has a voice in Decentraland's product development via Binding Governance Proposals, until a formal pathway for feature requests has been established.\n\n**Voting Options**\n\nThere will be four voting options for this Pre-Proposal Poll, to ensure an accurate signal of community perceptions is captured.\n\n*   First, a vote for ONLY the \"RFI Pathway\"\n*   Second, a vote for ONLY the \"Interim Feature Request Response Pathway\"\n*   Third, a vote in favor of BOTH of the above pathways\n*   Four, a vote against the proposal in general\n\n- Yes, Vote in Favor of RFI Pathway (only)\n- Yes, Vote in Favor of Interim Feature Request Response Pathway Only\n- Yes, Vote in Favor of Both RFI & Feature Request Response Pathways\n- No, Vote against Promoting to Draft Proposal\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should the DAO limit the max VP accounted in a vote from an address?",
    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\nWhale voting has been a hot topic of discussion for a long time. The conversation happens privately between community members and in public forums such as the #whales-vote channel at DAO Discord and comments on any VP-related governance proposal.\n\nThere are two major concerns about limiting VP in a vote:\n\n*   Preventing sybil attacks such as splitting assets into many accounts to remove the limitations.\n*   A roll-out strategy that enables the DAO and members to experiment, learn, and iterate. Since the VP strategy is a cornerstone of the DAO, changes to it should be gradual.\n\nOf all the alternatives I heard about, this is the one that I have more confidence in as a first step toward limiting whale power:\n\n**Limit the maximum VP accounted from an address to XX% of the threshold of a vote. XX% should be 50% for grant proposals and 80% for any other proposal type.**\n\nFor example:\n\n*   POI, Catalysts,  Names Bans and Polls \\[500k VP threshold] => 400k VP Limit.\n*   Draft Proposals  \\[1M VP threshold] => 800k VP Limit.\n*   Linked Wearables  \\[4M VP threshold] => 3.2M VP Limit.\n*   20k Grant \\[2M VP threshold] => 1M VP Limit.\n*   80k Grant \\[4.4M VP threshold] => 2.2M VP Limit.\n*   Governance has a 6M threshold => 4.8M VP Limit.\n\nThe change will:\n\n*   Set up a simple framework to limit the VP threshold on each proposal type.\n*   Level the ground between small and big holders on low threshold votes.\n*   Strong impact on Grant proposals, requiring at least two whales to approve the funding.\n*   Low impact on governance proposals (that can approve/update these limits).\n\n**Sybil Attacks**\\\nThe proposed VP limit scheme doesn't prevent an individual to split their assets into many accounts to overcome such limits. However, the risk is mitigated because the splitting operation is operationally expensive for MANA and LAND holders, and impossible for ESTATE and Delegated VP holders. If the DAO recognizes this behavior in the wild, a new proposal should be formulated to address the matter.\n\n**Roll Out Strategy**\nStart now with a basic framework and test a strong limit on Grant Proposals since they are the most vulnerable to single-whale voting. Let's keep these systems working for a year and then target to lower the limits based on the results and learnings (e.g. 20% grant vp limit and 50% as a general vp limit).\n\n- Yes, 50% Grant VP Limit and 80% General VP Limit\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

These issues can result in governance decisions being made by a small subset of the community, or in a lack of engagement and buy-in for key decisions.\n\nOur proposal seeks to address this problem by increasing voter turnout and community engagement in Decentraland's governance process. We will achieve this by leveraging our automated proposal notification tool and direct voting system, which streamlines the voting process and makes it easier and more convenient for members to participate in governance.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,001 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC4566F9783DB8c3DDC145FeafDff6Ec644E1b380\n\n## Email address\n\narda@mefi.ca\n\n## Description\n\nWe propose leveraging our automated proposal notification tool and direct voting system, which streamlines the voting process and makes it easier and more convenient for members to participate in governance. Our notification tool will send email notifications to all DAO members about new proposals, increasing voter turnout and promoting more active participation from the community. What's more, our email feature uses ChatGPT's language generation technology to summarize each proposal, making it easier for people to quickly understand the key points and make informed voting decisions. The direct voting system will allow members to vote on proposals with a few clicks within the notification email, further streamlining the process and making it even more convenient for members to participate in governance.\n\nHow it works:\n1- Decentraland members can opt-in to receive email notifications through our website.\n2- Whenever there is a new proposal, our automated notification tool will send an email to all opted-in members. This email will include a summary of the proposal, generated using ChatGPT's language generation technology, to make it easier for members to quickly understand the key points.\n3- Each email will include a link to the proposal page where members can directly cast their vote on the proposal.\n\nIn summary, our proposal to increase voter turnout and community engagement in Decentraland's governance process is a critical step in building a more democratic and inclusive community. Our proposal leverages our automated proposal notification tool and direct voting system, which streamlines the voting process and makes it easier and more convenient for members to participate in governance. We believe that our project will make a meaningful contribution to the growth and success of the Decentraland community, and we are excited to partner with Decentraland to help build a more participatory and effective governance system.\n\nOur existing webpage can be found at https://daohub.xyz\n\n\n## Budget Specification\n\nWe are requesting $5,000 DAI. 90% of the funds will be used for research\\&development and 10% will be allocated for API services such as Mailgun.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nArda Erturk - CEO & Founder https://www.linkedin.com/in/ardaerturk/\nI studied machine learning & data science at University of Toronto between 2016-2021.

    "body": "> by 0x858343382132b9ab46c857a7d52fdbafc039f784 (Zino)\n\nOne of our goals as a Grant Support Squad is to take care of the DAO Treasury.  During the first four months of our Squad, we went through [58 grants that were finished  ($3.5M USD)](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7a236540-d305-11ec-b521-2f98ffa6ccb0) before the Grant Support Squad existed, and we were concerned about  17 of those grants regarding the achievement of what they had proposed. This represents 1,3M USD.  Almost 50% of the available funds were provided to grants during that period.\n\nIn the active grants, we found cases where the Grantees wouldn’t complete the project that the community had voted on and some other projects that were delayed on the proposed roadmap. The difficulty in these cases was that **the contracts of these grants were still vesting.**\n\nFor that reason, we recommended to the DAO Committee (who has the ability to stop the vesting contracts using the action named “revoke”), to execute the only technical mechanism that the DAO had to stop vesting contracts as a preventive action.\n\nBut this took implications for the reputation of the grantees, so we worked on mitigating the negative impact that the “revocation” has on our grantee´s reputation by requesting the DAO Committee to implement the pause feature, which allows a preventive pause in the vesting contract, freezing the funds until the case is solved.\n\nAlso, we went through a governance process to create a [Revocations Committee](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ce104d00-7d94-11ed-8456-a323c09ee17e) where the community voted for the procedure of the initial setup, which is the following:\n\n1.  There will be an open application period in the forum (like the community has done in the past and is doing with the new [DAO Committee member](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569)). Applications will be submitted by the prospects as posts on the forum, and applicants should answer the questions mentioned in the complete framework. This action was executed [here](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-for-accountability-committee-members/17546/2).\n\n2.  The Grant Support Squad interviews the candidates and makes a final selection of 5 members and two substitutes. For the creation of this committee and its renewals, the final selection will be presented to the community in a poll. This was also done [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bcec8570-b6b0-11ed-99e0-b5bb1e9f1959).\n\n3.  There will be a final poll for the community to vote to accept or decline this selection. This process will be repeated when the committee is renewed. As this was rejected by the community, we are now posting potential solutions to this blocker in this poll.\n\nThe Community flagged that the procedure to set up the initial Revocations Committee should be similar to the process of adding a new DAO Committee member. Specifically, the community would want the opportunity to interview the candidates.\n\nIt's important to note that, to honor the process of votation and keep the legitimacy of the governance process that we as a DAO have, we are here proposing two ways to get through this blocker:\n\n**Meet the candidates:** Go through the procedure voted, re-submit the selected candidates' poll but before that including an open session hosted by the Facilitation Squad to introduce them, and be better informed to vote if the candidates are a good fit for the position.\nIf this option is selected, the details of the session will be informed through Discord by the Facilitation Squad.\n\n**Meet and vote for the candidates:** The Facilitation Squad would host an open session where the selected five candidates and two substitutes can be introduced. Then the Grant Support Squad would submit one poll per candidate, following the DAO Committee´s procedure.\nThis will improve the previously voted procedure, give the community the opportunity to meet the members and also have the possibility of accepting or rejecting each of them in their own separate poll.\nIf this option is selected, the details of the session will be informed through Discord by the Facilitation Squad.\n\n- Meet the candidates\n- Meet and vote for the candidates:\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Creation of DAO-Owned Catalyst Archival Node for Decentraland Core",
    "body": "> by 0xe400a85a6169bd8be439bb0dc9eac81f19f26843 (howieDoin)\n\nShould the following $19,800 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe believe there is a need to provide a DAO-owned Decentraland catalyst node for the community to use for applications. This node would be deployed as an archival node to make additional, historical data available to the community. The DAO-owned node would not be used to support users in world but instead to power an ecosystem of apps; thereby replacing the load on the existing catalyst node network.\n\nWe will also be developing an open source code base that can be used in conjunction with a historical node to query common requests against the historical database, host the infrastructure, and make it available to the community for one year alongside [our other DAO Data APIs](https://dao-data.atlascorp.io/redoc).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n19,800 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe64581F067Cfdce58657E3c0F58175e638C30f2B\n\n## Email address\n\nhowie@atlascorp.io\n\n## Description\n\nThe catalyst node network currently supports users as they play in Decentraland. The node network saves information on scene deployments, user profiles, and other Decentraland content that is not directly on chain but requires storage. Any application that wants to use this data – say to display the profile pictures of the user on an app, or to understand what parcels are associated with a scene – would use the APIs available on the catalyst nodes. If the application ecosystem around Decentraland begins to scale, this may cause an undue burden or strain on the node network as this load is above and beyond what is required to support users in game.\n\nSimilar to the DAO Data Aggregation initiative we undertook at the end of last year, we believe there is a need to stand up a dedicated catalyst node which can be used by the community for applications and application development. We are requesting funds which will translate directly into infrastructure costs to support an Application node with historical data.\n\nThis idea was conceived of by @Zino of the Grant Support Squad, with [Atlas CORP](https://atlascorp.io) volunteering to support the deployment and backfilling of data required.\n\n\n## Budget Specification\n\nThis project will cost the DAO $19,800 and will take approximately 2-3 months to deploy.\nThis breaks down into:\n\n**$7,400.00 - Infrastructure and Hosting Costs**\\*:\n\n•\tBudget for Digital Ocean API servers for one year\n\n•\tBudget for Digital Ocean Volumes (<=5TB) for one year\n\n•\tReimbursement to @HPrivakos for any data transfer or costs incurred in assisting in the set up.\n\n\\**This estimate is based on current pricing for each of the above platforms. $7,400 may not last a full year if pricing is altered by the provider.*\n\n**$10,000.00 - Development Costs** (estimated 3 month delivery):\n\n•\tConfiguration and deployment of historical catalyst node\n\n•\tAPI query development resources to produce queries and prevent overuse\n\n•\tDevOps and infrastructure development resources to automate as much as possible\n\n•\tTechnical Writing resources to provide user-facing API documentation\n\n**$2,400 - Ongoing Support Costs** (6 months post deployment):\n\n•\tCode updates when breaking changes occur due to external forces\n\n•\tAPI Documentation updates\n\n•\tAPI query user support in the Decentraland discord\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe development of this data platform would be done by the Atlas CORP ([@atlascorp_dcl](https://twitter.com/AtlasCorp_dcl)) team, who have extensive experience working with this data set:\n\n•\tHowieDoin – Lead Analytics & Infrastructure innovation\n\n•\tMorrisMustang – Lead DCL & Solidity innovation\n\n•\tJosephAaron – Operations and task management\n\n•\tStaleDegree – Senior Solidity/UI Development\n\n•\tRyanNFT –Solidity/DCL Developer\n\n•\tMrFlickIt – UX and Design\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nCurrently the footprint of a node is about 2.25 TB which is expected to grow over time. This proposal covers 12 months of cloud infrastructure costs – a server with the appropriate horsepower as well as a volume to persist the 3-5 TB of \\[current and future] data required to host the catalyst node with historical data. We are currently working with the Foundation to transfer the current source of historical catalyst data which @HPrivikos stewards over to our catalyst node.\n\nThis node will then be made available to the community, which is encouraged to transfer queries to this new node. Instead any application that requires catalyst node data including player profile, scene definitions, and any new functionality to get  comprehensive history should be served from this application-supporting catalyst node.\n\nAn open source API will be developed to perform queries against the historical data. These API queries will include information that has been asked of the Atlas CORP team but to date are not possible to answer without a historical catalyst node. These queries may include the ability to answer the following questions:\n\n•\tWhen did a user first sign up for Decentraland?\n\n•\tWhat is a user’s “user number”, from the ranked order all users signed up for Decentraland?\n\n•\tWhat parcels did a scene cover in the past?\n\n•\tWhat parcels did a scene cover over time?\n\nQuery documentation (e.g. Redoc) will be published and made available for users looking to operate or integrate with the API.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

Our goal is to provide developers, users, and other stakeholders with high-quality technical documentation that is accurate, accessible, and easy to understand. Our end goal is to ensure that the technical documentation for the Decentraland community is of the highest quality, making it easier for developers to build on these platforms and for users to understand and utilize them effectively.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n20,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4021ab4fF929206503199e6Ce3b20e10eeB9C4f3\n\n## Email address\n\nBobbi@LedgerAcademy.com\n\n## Description\n\nThe project to supply documentation standards for community users to create learning materials should receive funding for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, Decentraland is a rapidly growing virtual world platform that is attracting more users every day. As the platform expands, there is an increasing need for educational materials to help users understand how to use Decentraland effectively. This project will help to meet that need by providing clear and concise documentation standards for community users to create high-quality learning materials.\n\nSecondly, by providing these standards, the project will help to ensure that the learning materials created by community members are consistent, easy to understand, and effective in conveying important information about Decentraland. This will not only benefit new users who are just getting started with the platform, but also experienced users who are looking to expand their knowledge and skills.\n\nFinally, the project will help to foster a strong and supportive community within Decentraland by encouraging users to share their knowledge and expertise with others. This will help to build a sense of community and collaboration, which is essential for the long-term success of the platform.\n\nIn summary, the project to supply documentation standards for community users to create learning materials will help to address an important need within the Decentraland platform, improve the quality of educational materials available to users, and foster a stronger and more supportive community. For these reasons, it is a worthy candidate for funding.\n\n\n## Budget Specification\n\nTask Force Expenses:\n\nWriters, Editors: time and expenses\nWiki page or Git hub repo set up\nMarketing / Social media  publish standards\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nBobbi Muscara: Currently a member of the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee and the Chairperson of the Hyperledger Learning Materials Development Working Group where she is responsible for moderating the bi-weekly meetings, and setting agendas while maintaining the Confluence Wiki Page and developing the documentation standards for Hyperledger Projects and Special Interest Groups.

This is a limited and numbered collection, which holders can redeem the physical pair of sneakers along with its digital wearable or leave it untouched and properly shrink wrapped under our custody, while waiting to resell it. The physical sneakers were hand tailored after the mint phase of the NFTs, making them pretty exclusive and special. In addition to the physical and the wearable versions of the sneaker, the NFT's holders have several other benefits related to Reserva's products, events and community. SPRIZ NFT was the second NFT collection launched by ReservaX, following the success of the first one: the Pistol Birds.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nReservaX believes in the true essence of the Metaverse, and sees in Decentraland a great opportunity to make tangible all the concepts involved in this new phase of Web. Beyond that, Decentraland has a very unique way of representing the digital version of the sneakers, not only due to its flexible art style, but also because of features like Linked Werables, which is the best way of delivering the holders the exclusivity they deserve.\n\nIn addition, Reserva believes that Decentraland has a great fit with its strategy to expand to external market, due to the platform's global focus. Being one of the most valuable companies in the Arezzo\\&CO group, Reserva is now entering the metaverse and the external market.\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n4\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nhttps://opensea.io/reservax/created\n\nNote that this wallet address is the same used in our OpenSea account, which has a verified badge.

    "title": "Increase DAO Security: SAB Upgrade",
    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (LordLike)\n\nThis is **a poll to start the process of increasing security of DAO critical smart contracts by upgrading SAB with mandatory function as a second layer of security on top of the DAO Committee** to mitigate risks that include scammers, black hackers or human factor.\n\nSAB controls and can update Decentraland DAO core smart contracts, can add or remove DAO Committee members. It is vital for Decentraland and DAO to maintain and improve SAB security.\n\n**1.WHAT ARE [DECENTRALAND SMART CONTRACTS](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/what-smart-contracts-does-the-dao-control/)  ?**\n\nThe Decentraland DAO owns several of the most critical smart contracts of the Decentraland platform. They are listed below:\n\n*   The LAND contract. This is the contract that manages the LAND tokens. The DAO is the owner of the LAND smart contract. This means that any changes or modifications to that contract must be carried out by the DAO and the SAB.\n\n*   The Estate contract. Like the LAND contract, the DAO owns the Estate contract which can only be modified by the SAB, after approval has been given by the DAO through a community vote.\n\n*   POIs. The list of Points of Interest is also owned by the DAO. This list is stored on a contract and can only be modified after passing a vote by the community that is then enacted on-chain by the DAO Committee.\n\n*   Names. The contracts used to mint the NFTs for unique avatar names in Decentraland are owned and controlled by the DAO. Any changes to the names contract must be approved by the DAO.\n\n*   Banned names. The list of names that have been banned from the Decentraland client is stored in a contract owned by the DAO. This list can only be modified after passing a vote by the community that is then enacted on-chain by the DAO Committee.\n\n*   Catalyst nodes.The list of Catalyst nodes that serve content and establish the peer-to-peer connections needed to keep Decentraland’s virtual world running is also owned and controlled by the DAO. This list is stored on a contract and can only be modified after passing a vote by the community that is then enacted on-chain by the DAO Committee.\n\n*   Wearables collections. The contracts used to manage wearables collections are owned and controlled by the DAO.\n\n*   Marketplace contracts. These contracts are also where the marketplace fees are defined, and can only be changed with the DAOs approval.\n\n*   Grants. The vesting contracts used to make recurring payments as part of the DAO’s Grant framework are also owned by the DAO. These contracts are created by the DAO Committee on behalf of the DAO, and are overseen by the SAB to prevent any risk of monetary loss due to vulnerabilities or mistakes made by the Committee.\n\n**2. HOW [DAO](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/how-does-the-dao-work/) WORKS ?**\n\nDecentraland’s DAO uses off-chain voting for the community and a multi-sig wallet controlled by a “DAO Committee '' to enact those off-chain decisions on the Ethereum blockchain. The use of a multi-sig wallet is controlled by a DAO Committee which is composed of trusted persons which guarantee the DAO security and enact proposals. A second multi-sig owned by the SAB provides a second layer of security on top of the DAO Committee.\n\n**3. WHAT IS [SAB](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/overview/how-does-the-dao-work/) ?**\n\nSAB is the Security Advisory Board responsible for the security of Decentraland DAO Aragon smart contracts including LAND and Estate contracts. The SAB controls updates on DAO Aragon smart contract and other smart contracts owned by Aragon. They respond to vulnerability and bug reports in any of Decentraland’s contracts.\n\nThe SAB includes 5 experts that have initially been selected by the Decentraland dev  team.\n\nAny time a modification is to be made to the LAND or Estate contracts, the update must be unanimously supported by the SAB’s multi-sig. At least three signatories are required with no dissenting votes in order to make any changes to the LAND or Estate contracts. The SAB has the ability to pause, resume, or cancel any action taken by the DAO Committee.\nFunds transfers from DAO Aragon smart contracts can be initialized by one DAO Committee member or done by 3 out of 5 SAB members (only in extreme cases related to security of smart contracts).\n\nAfter a transaction is initiated a 24h execution delay starts. Within those 24h, any DAO Committee member (or SAB member) can pause or cancel that fund transfer.\n\n**4. WHAT IS DAO COMMITTEE**\n\nThe DAO Committee is a group of three trusted individuals who have been selected by the community to hold keys in a multi-sig wallet. This multi-sig is responsible for enacting any passed votes with a binding action, like funding a Grant, banning a name, adding or removing a POI, implementing a Governance proposal or adding a Catalyst node.\nEvery on-chain transaction initiated by the DAO Committee has an automatic 24-hour delay before it is completed, allowing the SAB or the DAO Committee members to revoke the transaction during this period of time .\n\n**5. POSSIBLE RISKS:**\n\nIn theory DAO Committee members can be hacked or colluded with each other for fraudulent activities and there will be no mandatory force that will stop them.\n\n**The Security Advisory Board does not oversee the operations and what is being done with the DAO or DAO Committee actions, they are purely for smart contracts security.**\n\nSAB can cancel funds movements from the DAO Aragon wallet, but they are not supposed to do it unless it's clearly something that should not happen. (Rogue DAO Committee or hacked address trying to steal money).\n\nAlso, a 24 hour transaction execution delay is a pretty small amount of time and bad actors can choose date and time which will increase risk of transaction being unnoticed such as weekend, holiday or resonant event that will distract attention.\n\n**6. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:**\n\n*   Add SAB a mandatory function of overseeing DAO transactions including DAO Committee actions by certain filters, for example if the transaction is more than a certain sum or transaction frequency.\n\n*   Increase transaction execution time delay. For example, from 24 hours to 48 hours.\n\n*   Interview SAB members by the community once a year to ensure they are alive, in their right mind, have not lost the keys and are committed to continue performing their responsibilities. (Interviews can be held in Town Halls for example.)\n\nThe SAB members' possible compensation can be discussed in other proposal.\n\nThese are forward thoughts to start community discussion on security issues or concerns that should be solved or mitigated.\n\n**7. VOTING OPTIONS:**\n\n**Yes: I support this proposal as a starting point to increase DAO smart contracts security.**\n\nFinal actions on improving DAO smart contracts security and their implementation pathways will be described in DRAFT and GOV proposals after achieving community consensus in discussions.\n\n**No: Leave as it is.**\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

This change would allow users to submit events hosted in a World.\n*   When players click \"Jump in\" on the event card, they would go to the World.\n*   These World events would appear in the [Events website](http://events.decentraland.org/), and in the Events tab in the [client](http://play.decentraland.org/).\n\n### Integration with Places\n\n*   Right now, the [Places website](http://places.decentraland.org/) and the Explore menu in the [client](http://play.decentraland.org/) only show locations in Genesis City. This change would let these interfaces show Worlds too.\n*   Worlds might shown in a different section from Genesis City locations in the user interface, to make it easier to tell them apart.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe believe these changes would make Worlds more useful, and allow more users to discover Worlds.

ITM (Into The Metaverse) is the adidas pledge to the metaverse.\n\nAdidas will present Virtual Gear at Decentraland’s Metaverse Fashion Week, a 4-day celebration of fashion in the Metaverse. adidas will bring an exclusive and community focused experience that brings ITM holders and decentraland users together, centered around culture , music and fashion.\n\nAdidas Virtual Gear is our first NFT collection of wearables, a new, interoperable product category, accelerating our collective drive towards strengthening web3, and the adidas community-based, member-first, open metaverse pledge.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAdidas mission is to be the best sports brand in the open metaverse. The adidas VG (Virtual Gear) is the first digital fashion from the brand that aims to start allowing communities to build and live in their virtual identity. Decentraland would be the first platform to have VG for their community and as a much loved brand, there has been high demand from the adidas community to have a place to utilize their VG to represent who they are. Decentraland would be that place. Decentraland’s MVFW is an excellent opportunity to showcase the value and power of a virtual world to the globe, a metaverse where culture and community meet.\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n16\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nadidas confirmed IP rights to Decentraland / DAPPCRAFT to create this collection in DCL\n\n\n## Smart Contract Address\n\n- 0xBA0C9CF4Da821dBa98407Cc4f9c11f6C7A5F9bbc\n\n\n## Manager Address\n\n- 0x3cf368FaeCdb4a4E542c0efD17850ae133688C2a\n\n\n## Is this collection generated programmatically?\n- No\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Meeple Madness MVFW: Tier One Request for 1,500USD",
    "body": "> by 0x0313b00c066ba9e9791cb4f7064c0a1e8a230dad (LUCII)\n\nShould the following $1,500 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nMeeple Madness is an exhilarating metaverse game that takes place in the clouds, high above the ground. Players navigate through a vibrant and colorful world, jumping and running across floating platforms and obstacles as they compete in a parkour-style race to the top.  Once the player has reached a sufficient level in the game they are granted access to an exclusive Meeples wearable. Meeple madness will be built on Meeples DCL ENS and will be active during MVFW with possible time expansion based on user feedback.\n\nMeeples (#meeplesforthepeoples) is a DCL native wearable project created by LUCII that started during MVMF 2022. LUCII is a verified DCL wearables creator and has been a contributor in DCL for 1+ years.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n1,500 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x0313b00C066Ba9e9791Cb4F7064C0A1e8A230DaD\n\n## Email address\n\ninfo@luciidigital.com\n\n## Description\n\nWith funding, LUCII can continue to improve and expand the Meeple IP, providing players with even more engaging content and experiences.  Meeple Madness is a game that is not only fun but also has the potential to become a cultural phenomenon, and investing in its development is a smart move for anyone interested in the future of gaming in DCL.  Meeple Madness has the potential to bring a range of benefits to the metaverse, including increased engagement, social interaction, and diversity. By investing in the game's development, we can help to create a metaverse that is more vibrant, dynamic, and inclusive for everyone.\n\n\n## Budget Specification\n\nMaria is requesting 800USD to develop the game, the rest of the funds will be used to cover wearable publishing costs for LUCII and/or be put towards marketing costs.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nDesigner/3D Assets: LUCII (Lucia Kramarczuk) Los Angeles, USA\nMeeples/LUCII: https://lucii.io/avatars\n\nGame Developer: MAP (Maria Martinez) Canary Islands, SPAIN\nPortfolio: https://linktr.ee/map.space\n\nCheck out what we've built so far:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qUvC13uNyS9e2cIIOK7xeAeuac0sGXYc?usp=share_link\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n1: Core Development\n\nIn this phase, the development team would focus on creating the core gameplay mechanics, user interface, and other essential features of the game. This would involve creating the different 3D assets for the game,, designing the game's world and meeple claims.\n\n2: Testing\n\nOnce the core development is complete, the game would move into an alpha testing phase. This would involve inviting a small group of players to test the game and provide feedback on its features, mechanics, and overall experience. This feedback would be used to identify any bugs or issues that need to be addressed before the game's public launch.\n\n4: Public Launch: March 28th\n\nOnce the beta testing phase is complete, the game would be ready for public launch. This would involve a marketing campaign to raise awareness of the game and attract new players. The launch would also include ongoing updates and improvements to the game based on player feedback.\n\n5: Post-Launch Support\n\nAfter the game is launched, the development team would continue to provide ongoing support and updates to ensure that the game remains engaging and enjoyable for players. This would involve regular content updates, bug fixes, and feature improvements based on player feedback.\nOverall, this roadmap would allow the development team to create a polished and engaging metaverse game that meets the needs and expectations of players while also allowing for ongoing updates and improvements over time.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "ShelleyVan x TRU Band Room",
    "body": "> by 0xc82fd31500576f394b59be3b10c154b584ea6004 (ShelleyVan)\n\nShould the following $120,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe TRU Band Room (TRU), under the management of Shelley VanWitzenburg (ShelleyVan), is the premier music venue in Decentraland (DCL) for new and emerging independent artists. Since October 2021, ShelleyVan has onboarded over 125 artists and showcased more than 500 live events, drawing thousands of music lovers to DCL. Many of the most-recognizable performers in DCL got their start at TRU. As a proven leader and community builder, ShelleyVan and TRU are seeking DAO funding to cover retroactive expenses and expand and improve operations, including further development of partnerships and co-marketing to amplify promotional efforts of the entire DCL ecosystem—with user growth and retention remaining top of agenda.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe7289b376F831efB1f2549DC59171CB3a5a0a3CF\n\n## Email address\n\nrockwithtrus@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nShelleyVan has over 12 years of experience in SEO and online content creation, partnering with brands such as Disney, KIA, and Xcaret Properties. During her time managing TRU, many highly successful musicians and DJs in DCL have made their metaverse debut here, including Bufalo, Mr.Swe, DJ T-Rax, Jack Frost, Pan’s DJ, Coconut Sunday, The Musical Doc, and Ash Orphan. During the last year, she has maintained a consistent schedule of live performances, averaging five to ten shows per week, and has developed a comprehensive DCL onboarding experience.\n\nIn addition to managing the live performances, ShelleyVan spends a considerable amount of time onboarding artists and providing tech support, including soundchecks and web3/NFT consultation. With additional funding, a structure will be developed which allows ShelleyVan to expand the onboarding experience to larger communities. To achieve this goal, multimedia resources will be developed, including video courses, one-page guides, social media content, and SEO blog articles targeting specific web3/metaverse keywords to capture new audiences.\n\nAs co-founder of Songbird Collective, a digital marketing agency, ShelleyVan has developed partnerships and relationships with a large number of web2 social media influencers, who have yet to experience web3 or the metaverse. The expansion of onboarding will include targeting those influencers with established, engaged audiences to accelerate DCL user growth and retention objectives.\n\nAlso, building on existing Decentraland partnerships, ShelleyVan/TRU will expand co-marketing and promotional opportunities with other DCL venues and projects. During the last year, TRU has partnered with casa Roustan, Dollhouse, Cromuland/YouMack, Sugar Club, and MetaParty to amplify promotional content for events. This co-marketing has helped achieve increased attendance and user retention by promoting a multi-venue schedule of events. An expansion of TRU operations will increase the opportunity to plan and execute larger and more frequent multi-venue events–aligning with strategic objectives to increase DCL user growth.\n\n**Examples of Community Experiences:**\n\n**DCLMVMF22:**\nThe TRU Stage at Decentraland Metaverse Music Festival ran 31 shows in 4 days, hosting independent musicians from all over the world\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMtK8wgr6Pk\n\n**Connecting the \\[POI] Stars:**\nCommunity line-up between casa Roustan and TRU Band Room to connect the dots on the map\n\nhttps://twitter.com/decentraland/status/1503103595578859528\n\nShelleyVan to attend IRL Events -\n\nNFT LA - confirmed\n\nNFT NYC - TBD\n\n**The TRU SHOAP:**\n\nThe TRU proprietary attendance token system has already airdropped tokens to nearly 2,000 Decentraland users since May 1st 2022.\n\nNovember 2, 2022 - Introduced AI-Generated SHOAP Art\n\nIn collaboration with the performing artist, AI-generated artwork is used for the token, creating a truly unique memento for attendees.\n\n\n## Budget Specification\n\nIn addition to maintaining an aggressive calendar of events, TRU Band Room will expand their onboarding experience to music, NFT, and web2 communities. Currently, Band Room activities require nearly 60 hours of work per week. The expanded TRU operation, under the management of ShelleyVan/Songbird Collective, will utilize the following to achieve an increase in event attendance and improve user retention:\n\nBuild SEO and content strategy to establish pillar articles focusing on DCL–-all supporting content will link back to these pillar articles. Examples of pillar topics include technical requirements, web3 safety, and comprehensive DCL user guide.\n\nLIVE DCL onboarding boot camps held at least monthly, targeting already established communities and individual new users.\n\n\\-Continue to support independent musicians’ success in DCL, offering a free stage for them to market their work and find their footing with superior quality sound/video capabilities in DCL\n\n\\-Continue running 6+ live events per week (recent attendance on parcel ranges between 30-100 visitors)\n\n\\-Continue using and improving proprietary attendance token airdrop system to draw new users (free NFT airdropped to all who attend shows in DCL) https://opensea.io/collection/tru-shoap\n\n\\-Quarterly festival-style events (multi-venue when possible)\n\n**To address the elephant in the room:** Yes, The Rocking Uniquehorns is an NFT project. So far, all the revenue that was generated was either used to directly support independent artists or to fund the building, land rental, marketing & operational costs associated with the TRU Band Room in Decentraland.\n\nIt was never a typical NFT project with the intention of selling out fast and catering to the trading part of the web3 user base. It was designed as a slow mint from the very beginning, so that it allows people to see and experience what we’re about and have a way of showing their support for our mission of bringing music to the metaverse, by minting a TRU. We absolutely love the community we’re building this way and this will be the way we continue to run that part of the project.\n\nThat being said, if for whatever reason the minting pace picks up (wen bull? ;) ) and we happen to mint out the collection, we’re more than happy to pay it forward or repay this grant.\n\nTo help cover some of the costs of the last year+ of event hosting, server fees, outsourced building, etc. TRU is requesting a retroactive amount of $60,000 and an additional $60,000 for the next year.\n\n**See full budget breakdown here:**\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1ProxmIuVOrQY8hkd7JuwinqJLDtP_Hdx/view?usp=share_link\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**Business Websites:**\n\nSongbird Collective: https://songbirdcoagency.com/\n\nSoftware Brauerei: https://software-brauerei.ch\n\n**ShelleyVan:**\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/teenybod\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/travelingteenybug/\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/shelleyvan/\n\nWriting example: https://blockster.com/metaverse-hotspot-body-painter-paul-roustan-just-keeps-building-in-decentraland\n\n**TRU:**\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Uniquehorns_nft\n\nWebsite: https://rockinguniquehorns.com/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rockwithtrus/\n\n**Domenic Benz (UniKorn):**\n\nCo-founder of digital agency Software Brauerei AG in Switzerland. 20+ years of experience in software & digital product development.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TRU_UniKorn\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/domenic-benz\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Oct 31, 2021 - Feb 28, 2023:** hosted over 500 live events, onboarded over 125 musicians, which resulted in nearly 2000 unique event attendees (this number only reflects May 1, 2022-Feb 2023, we do not have an accurate count of users prior to that date)\n\n**March 2023 - March 2024:** 300+ live events, onboard an additional 50+ musicians new to DCL, and provide an immersive introduction to 10+ high-value web2 influencers\n\n**We will provide monthly updates here to include:**\n\nNumber of events hosted at TRU\n\nLinks to online content created (blog articles, YouTube videos)\n\nLinks to any newly onboarded artists, influencers, users\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\nShould the following $74,800 grant in the Platform category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nGrant renewal to maintain [studios.decentraland.org](https://studios.decentraland.org/). Previous grant proposal [here](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=81af5b00-02e6-11ed-8f44-ef1722f0509f).\n\nWe are the team that created and maintains Decentraland Studios (previously known as Verified Partners Registry). Our mission is to facilitate connections between brands and creators, and generate new business opportunities for them.\n\nOver the past 7 months we onboarded 150+ studios and helped them create portfolios in our platform to show their capabilities to potential clients. We are looking to renew our grant to continue creating job opportunities for creators and to improve the visibility of their work.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n74,800 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x256874B9FD26cBf11a4E2DE5CFFE5a877603044d\n\n## Email address\n\nmetaverse.studios@decentraland.org\n\n## Description\n\n[The first grant](https://governance.decentraland.org/update/?id=53fcc280-b941-11ed-95dc-afd12ca00986) of this project had the objective of setting up the website, creating the verification processes to ensure that only qualified creators are listed in the registry, and building connections with the Decentraland creators.\n\nThis renewal has the main focus of creating business opportunities for the members of the registry. To accomplish this, we will work on three key areas of the business growth of Decentraland creators:\n\n**Streamlining Job Opportunities for Decentraland Creators**\n\nWe are working on a feature through which brands can post job openings for Decentraland creators. Any brand can create a job indicating the type of project they want to develop (along with a description, skills needed, budget and timeline), and all Decentraland Studios will be able to apply. We expect this feature to remove friction for brands to hire Decentraland creators. The user flow for creating a job and applying to one will be similar to how [Dribbble implemented it](https://dribbble.com/freelance-jobs).\n\n**Lead generation**\n\nCreate performance marketing campaigns in web2 platforms such as Linkedin, Twitter, Google, and Instagram targeted to brand owners and marketers interested in building a presence in the Metaverse. The ads campaign will direct users to our landing page collecting their emails in exchange for an onboarding guide. After that point, the leads will be followed up by emails introducing interesting content and calling them to start a new project (see point above).\n\n**Maintenance and improvement**\n\nWe will continue onboarding and verifying studios to our platform while listening to our community and taking their feedback. Right now, we are looking to:\n\n*   Add search, filtering and sorting features to projects, studios and resources\n*   Keep improving the resource section, adding case studies and more scenes\n*   Keep updating the “Guide Into The Metaverse” and translating it to other languages\n*   Featuring projects to highlight skills and talent\n*   Having a dedicated section for Decentraland Studios in decentraland.org\n\nWe are looking to grow the following metrics:\n\n*   Visitors to our website\n*   Brands connecting with studios through our platform\n\n\n## Budget Specification\n\nSalaries:\n\n*   $12,200 USD per month or a total of $48,800 USD\n*   Total Hours: ~360 monthly hours or ~90 weekly hours.\n\nMarketing Budget:\n\n*   $200 USD per day, $6,000 USD per month or a total of $24,000 USD.\n*   Paid marketing campaigns at Instagram, Linkedin, Google, Twitter targeted to brand owners.\n\nOperations:\n\n*   $500 USD per month or a total of $2,000 USD\n*   Subscriptions to Calendly, Typeform, Sendgrid, Digital Ocean, Plausible, Figma.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n*   Alejandro Escoda — Operations and Communication [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-escoda-242295245/)\n*   Francisco Crespi — Product and Design [**Linkedin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franciscocrespi/)\n*   Omar Bobrow — Software Development [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omar-bobrow/)\n*   Open Position — Performance Marketing (ad creation, budget placement, and monitoring)\n\nThis team has been successfully working together since December. We are opening a new strategic position to overview and manage the marketing budget. This position is key to generate business opportunities and reach to new brand owners and marketing agencies.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nMonth 1\n\n*   Set up Instagram and Linkedin ad campaigns.\n*   Design a content strategy to follow up leads with\n*   Design and development of Job Opportunities feature.\n*   Implement search and filtering of profiles, projects, and resources.\n*   Translate the Metaverse Guide to Spanish.\n\nMonth 2\n\n*   Set up Google and Twitter ad campaigns.\n*   Launch of Job Opportunities Flow.\n*   Improve visibility of Studios in Decentraland home.\n*   Translate the Metaverse Guide to Portuguese.\n\nMonth 3\n\n*   Evaluate alternative distribution channels (eg. Magazines, Blog, Reddit)\n*   New release of the Metaverse Guide with improved content.\n*   Improving the resources section of the site.\n\nMonth 4\n\n*   Review the results of the marketing campaigns.\n*   Featuring projects to highlight skills and talent.\n*   Propose a follow-up project roadmap based on the results.\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

In this context, having a code of ethics can be essential for defining the values and principles that guide the organization’s behavior and decision-making processes.\n\nBy establishing a set of values and principles that align with the interests of the community, the organization can ensure that its decisions are consistent with its members’ expectations. This, in turn, can help build trust and confidence in the DAO, both among its members and the wider public.\n\nAnother advantage of having a code of ethics is that it can provide a framework for decision-making. By defining the ethical principles that guide the organization’s behavior, the DAO can ensure that its choices are consistent with its values and priorities. This can help the organization to make more informed and responsible decisions, which can enhance its reputation and credibility.\n\nA code of ethics can also help to promote a positive culture within the organization. By setting out the behaviors and attitudes that are expected of members, the DAO can create a sense of shared purpose and identity. This, in turn, can help to foster a culture of collaboration, trust, and mutual respect, which can enhance the organization’s effectiveness and resilience.\n\nHaving a code of ethics can help to ensure that the Decentraland DAO is viewed as a responsible and trustworthy organization. By establishing a clear set of ethical standards and principles, the organization can differentiate itself from other blockchain-based platforms and attract new members and investors who are looking for a community-driven, socially responsible organization.\n\nThe development of the code of ethics will be a collaborative process involving the community, and its contents will be proposed in Draft and Governance proposals after discussion with community members.\n\nYou can add your thoughts what should be in the code of ethics in the comments below or on the forum topic below.\n\nhttps://forum.decentraland.org/t/code-of-ethics-conduct/18238\n\nTo vote, select one of the following options:\n\nYes: Start process of creating and implementing a code of ethics.

Encouraging grantees to use their existing funds effectively, which can lead to the development of more impactful and sustainable projects.\n\n2.

    "body": "> by 0x1d11f567d0b4486ae3857284c2603ff0faf8ad5e (serenaelis)\n\nShould the following $60,000 grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nDaydream X SEA LLC,. built Serena Elis World in DCL, and has been steadily active since August of 2021. With weekly events, onboarding artists, we have held well over 80 shows on this parcel. Serena has performed over 200 shows to date. Between music, onboarding artists and blogging. We want to continue to grow our education and Performing Arts project. We have proven to be consistent bringing forth quality & Innovation. Since last grant, was able to connect with Brands like SONY, Gamerhash, & Pitchbook. Serena's becoming an experienced, competent, trusted, and reliable creator. Not just simple projects, ones that require interpersonal collaboration. This grant will let us continue to make strong influences & impacts.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x1D11f567D0b4486Ae3857284c2603FF0Faf8aD5E\n\n## Email address\n\ndxs@serenaelis.com\n\n## Description\n\nContinuation of Entertainment and resources for women with Education for the year of April 2023-2034\nSerena Elis World has been sharing her platform with other artists to help ease their way into their own journeys in Decentraland, while also providing value in the form of education. Our Values include Transparency, Innovation, Inclusivity, Boldness, and Quality. We want to continue to deliver resources and education for this project with IRL and in-game events, Curriculum,  as well as sharing these resources for all communities in web2/web3 spaces.\nKeeping inclusivity at the forefront, for everyone to learn and also be part of Musical Emersive events supporting Women and minorities.\n\nWe would like to continue to blog about the content creators already within the game and what they provide, How To’s, and other web3/Decentraland resources.\nOur future goal is to add another 96 Blogs on top of the 22 already created covering artists within the community with their information and other web 3 related topics. We want to continue this so new users and researchers know who to contact creatives, for services, learn, and get more insight into Decentraland.\nWe gained 2.5K Clicks as of today organically. An example of this we also brought BJORK fans from the last MVMF from our blogs. (Analytics are on the Canva link ) Bringing readers from events, and DCL activities. We want to continue to grow exposure from web 2 sites like Google, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc.\n\n1.Onboarding Women Entertainers and Minorities in Performing Arts\n\nSerena Elis World has also hosted and featured well-known female artists in the WEB 2 AND WEB 3 spaces. We have carefully and strategically crafted the presence of quality artists in DCL, and would like to continue in this grant to bring more female and diverse entertainers from different backgrounds, cultures, and races.\nWe would like to continue the onboarding process for the next year. The average time spent with each artist is about 5 hrs for the pre - event, plus another 2hr for each event. It takes about two  weeks to getting things setup for an event. With many connections in the entertainment industry before DCL, I take the responsibility and feel equipped to take on the task. I have worked in production for well known celebrity events for I have built a strong rapport with artists and celebrities, and also speak their language. We would like to take these skill sets and apply them to growing this project for the entire year. This is for everyone, but specifically to help minority groups and women.\n\nMore in depth about the previous artists and the impact here.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1uo79i0XlXmqYjAC8KFycq2IF6\\_HCpFsFdfOx0ik2qrU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nPURSUING MUSIC ARTISTIC ENDEAVORS\nI have put a lot of time, effort and money into increasing my name recognition and building a Decentraland reputation while also promoting the platform.  I want to continue to deliver quality performances and onboard a diverse group of artists.\nThis will allow me to create in DCL full time\n\\-keeping up innovation and fresh ideas\n\\-More collaborative work with IRL brands and community members.\n\\-Bring inspiration and new concepts to the table\n\\-Numerous concepts and formulas serena's created are being used in DCL today\\*\n\n\n## Budget Specification\n\nEDUCATION\n\nOur blogs worked out flawlessly when we onboarded performers with no knowledge about DCL. With the use of the resources and tools, plus guidance from expertise and experience in performing arts, it became a smooth transition for well-known creators to trust and take the leap.\nWe reached 10k accounts on social media platforms in 9 weeks onboarding females with a total of 85k followers. Organically, starting at 0. We realize how effective the blogs were through our website's analytics (which can be found Canva presentation) The key takeaway: as a performer with experience and time spent building, being relatable to entertainers and creators really made a unique difference and brought curiosity to them wanting to learn and know more.\nMy creation from the last grant was recognized by SONY.  I Was interviewed about my Innovation within the Metaverse, attending one of our DCL events,  and created an internal project for them. An NDA prohibited me from providing any more details.\nI am becoming an experienced, competent, and reliable creator within the web3 space. I get things done. Not just simple projects. Ones that require interpersonal collaboration and constant attention.We do want to continue to make strong influences and impact and draw eyes to this project from businesses, artists, and larger companies.\n\nMore on what we want to build . . .\n\n2.Curriculum\nThinkific  - FREE Lessons for OBS, How to deploy wearables, Virtual Performances, Behind The Scenes.\nPreparation : ( I) Planning, (II) Content and Methods, (III) Implementation, and (IV) Evaluation and Reporting.\nDXS wants to be inclusive to a variety of learners like kinesthetic, visual and auditory content making this a variety of ways to engage this will be. \\*This is an  effective long term strategy.

We want to continue this so new users and researchers know who to contact creatives, for services, learn, and get more insight inside DCL.\n\n5.Marketing\nThe blogs will help get more visibility from our interviews, with creating, how to build, and about the creators within DCL. DXS wants to be inclusive to a variety of learners like kinesthetic, visual and auditory content making this a variety of ways to engage. Jonathan Lovelady who has worked for UBER and Overstock in SEO, we will be guided through making our DCL content more searchable and accessible through proven marketing strategies. These services has a market value of approximately $5,000 up to $100,000 USD per month. However, they are being provided by a close contact and receive services large discount.\n\n6..

    "body": "> by 0xe17aeafd1d18b455232c92b77b03d042e1877e12 (PlayVerse)\n\nShould the following Higher Tier grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nPlayVerse is a playground lobby inside Decentraland, deployed on a 2x2 square land (**located at 36,8**), packed with lots of fun, functionalities & events for any player to enjoy and interact with other players. We have already developed a successful season 1 game (9th of January 2023 and will end on 6 of March 2023), \"UFO Attack\".\n\n**Play Link:** https://play.decentraland.org/?position=36%2C8\n\n**Gameplay link:** https://vimeo.com/803474514/51281c0503\n\nThe season 1 last for 8 weeks, during that time we achieved:\n\n*   Over 1200+ unique players\n*   170K+ games played\n*   AVG session time of over 48 minutes\n*   100+ unique inland MANA purchases\n\nWe are sure that our project aligns with the goals Decentraland.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe17AeaFd1d18B455232c92B77B03D042E1877e12\n\n## Email address\n\ncontact@tarkinstudios.com\n\n## Description\n\nPlayVerse is a place where users can discover the metaverse in a fun and engaging way through free-to-play games. Our platform not only offers enjoyable experiences that allow players to interact with others, but also serves as an introduction to the world of NFTs and the limitless possibilities of virtual reality. Right now, users join us and explore this new era of gaming, while earning a variety of prizes and wearables.\n\nAt PlayVerse we believe that our project aligns with the goals of Decentraland, which is to promote innovation and create new opportunities for the Decentraland community. We are excited about the potential of our project and the impact we are having on the Decentraland platform.\n\nBack in 2021 PlayVerse started with the mission to transform users into passionate gamers in Decentraland. We purchased a land and began studying on how to create our own vision of the Metaverse, and deploy incredible experiences for the Decentraland community. Then, in 2022, we launched our successful \"UFO Attack\" game very much aligned with Decentraland's vision of the metaverse, and our community quickly grew.\n\nGoals already Achieved:\n\n*   Top 5 most video game plays in DCL\n*   Top 3 most spent time inland in DCL\n*   Top 3 average time per session in DCL\n*   Top 5 land entries in DCL\n*   Top 5 most visited land in DCL\n*   Over 1200+ unique players\n*   170K+ games played\n*   AVG session time of over 48 minutes\n*   Growing social media communities (Twitter, Discord, Twitch, etc.)\n*   Revenue has been generated each month from in-game purchases, wearable royalties\n*   NFT prices up to 500 MANA at marketplace.\n*   Fully integrated NFT-based wearables with functionality.\n*   Released the PlayVerse Games NFT collection\n*   Released 8 NFT alien body parts (4 mythic & 4 unique)\n*   Super PlayVerse cape\n*   Farming game experience\n*   In-game leaderboards\n*   Multi-user lobby experience\n*   Easy-to-use UI\n*   Fun gaming quiz games with rewards\n*   Unique NFT in game utilities\n*   Back-end/server infrastructure for performance and better internal testing.\n\n\\*Source: https://dcl-metrics.com/\n\nWe created this content with joy & passion, hard work, and dedication, without any grant, only using our limited resources.\n\nOur vision for following seasons is to introduce new multiplayer mechanics, new categories of challenges, and more NFT prizes to incentivize the DCL community. With this grant, we aim to invest in developing the next season's games, improving our infrastructure, and expanding our team to provide even better gaming experiences for the community.\n\nWith this grant, we aim to invest in developing our season 2 & 3 games, improving our infrastructure, and expanding our team to provide even better gaming experiences including mechanics, new categories of challenges, and more NFT prizes to incentivize the actual community, and bring new players into DCL.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAlthough PlayVerse is a single-player game experience, our lobby has become a social hub where people can feel part of a gaming club chatting and sharing experiences with each other. With the next roadmap, we want to encourage multiplayer gameplay.\n\nWe would like to add some mini-games in the lobby, so active users can rush their way to the top of the leaderboards with boosters and in game advantages.\n\n**KingKong Stack**\n\nFor our season 2 we want to change the whole aspect of the land decoration and environment to go hand in hand with the new game “KingKong Stack”, an adapted 3D version of the popular game Stacker. KingKong Stack will introduce a totally new and fun game experience never seen before in Decentraland, easy to play, difficult to master.\n\nThe game will consist of 3x3 blocks that will be constantly moving side to side on top of a 3x3 block base. Moving direction will be determined by the user approach to the block's base. The aim is to pile the blocks on top of each other as high as possible, trying to reach the highest level to achieve the highest possible score. The score will be determined not only by the height of the tower, but also by the amount of blocks left when reaching the top.\n\nThis will add a whole new level of interaction and leaderboard competition for Decentraland players, creating a healthy but addictive game that will put the player skills to the test.\n\nIn addition, players who participated in Season 1 and already own a PlayVerse NFT collection wearable will have access to unique experiences and bonuses in Season 2 gameplay as part of the exclusive PlayVerse club, and to incentivize the Decentraland marketplace with PlayVerse NFT’s.\n\n**Sword Master**\n\nFor our upcoming season 3 game, we once again redesign our land and create a new and unique game experience for Decentraland players. Being an immersive adaptation of the popular game Key Master.\n\nSword Master is a game that will test the player skills, allowing them to push their limits as much as they want. The game UI design is as simple as it could be, a button that, when pressed, will move a stick with a sword attached to it vertically, if pressed again, the stick will start moving horizontally towards one of the holed wall holes on the wall. The holed wall holes size range from big to very tiny and tight, to perfectly fit the size of the sword. The player score will be determined by the size of the holed wall hole in which the sword is inserted, with higher scores achieved for smaller and more difficult holed wall holes.\n\nAs always, we plan to provide NFT prizes for top leaderboard game play winners, as well as some mini-games aimed for active inland users, helping them to get rewarded for playing at Decentraland.\n\n**Seasonal Wearables**\n\nPlayVerse season 2 & season 3, will continue to offer new, meticulously designed wearables:\n\n*   Unique\n*   Mythic\n*   Legendary\n*   Common\n\nThese wearables will be released on a weekly basis (for a total period of 6 months) to the top leaderboard game players, who will receive the NFTs completely free in their registered wallets.\n\nAdditionally, new players will have the opportunity to receive a PlayVerse cape simply by playing our games, as we will be giving them away to random users on a weekly basis too.\n\nDuring season 1, some of our NFT wearables were sold for 50 MANA. Our commitment to providing our users with unique and engaging gaming experiences, along with valuable NFT’s, is what sets us apart.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nPROJECT LEAD BY:\n\n**Jose Manuel García Franco:**\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jose-manuel-garc%C3%ADa-franco-a0b27918/\n\nemail: jm@tarkinstudios.com\n\n**Néstor Anaya:**\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nestoranaya/\n\nemail: nestor@tarkinstudios.com\n\n**Andrés Molina:**\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andresmolinaperez/\n\nemail: andres.molina@tarkinstudios.com\n\nPERSONNEL:\n\n*   1 Project Manager\n*   1 Community Manager/Support 24/7\n*   1 Game Designer\n*   1 Backend Developer\n*   1 Frontend Developer\n*   1 Gameplay programmer\n*   1 3D Artist\n*   1 UX Designer QA Tester\n*   1 Marketing Manager\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**Milestones**\n\n*   Redesign the lobby and land experience.\n*   Acquire sponsorship agreements with brands.\n*   Listen and work on new game plays proposed by the community.\n*   Increase the brand name by getting a 300% increase in visits to the land, as well as the game time.\n*   Launch the KingKong Stack game, with fully functional gameplay mechanics and scoring system.\n*   Launch the Sword Master game, with fully functional gameplay mechanics and scoring system.\n*   Implement NFT rewards for top leaderboard\n*   Develop a system for players to unlock unique experiences and rewards in upcoming seasons by wearing and using previous season wearables.\n*   Conduct ongoing community engagement, including social media promotion, Discord support, and live events.\n*   Achieve a minimum of 4-star rating on DappRadar and other Decentraland review platforms.\n*   Seek partnerships with other Decentraland developers and projects to expand the PlayVerse brand and offerings.\n\n**Total requested grant:** 60,000 USD\n\nBudget breakdown link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1giPITRQhmC1n1XKPr_HHyY4J2Rp8s_jQ5xo-j9rqqMY/edit?usp=sharing\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Dark Dungeons game",
    "body": "> by 0x2e09a10eaace1ef3a66fbf6f1f782c8c0cb8c942 (Soulsinger)\n\nShould the following Higher Tier grant in the In-World Content category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\n**Dark Dungeons** is a game similar to **Dungeons and Dragons** played worldwide by an enormous range of players. And it is no less intriguing to watch others play, as evidenced by the great success of organisations such as Critical Role. We believe a good implementation of this concept has the power to introduce many new users to Decentraland!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n54,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2e09A10eaAcE1Ef3a66FbF6F1F782C8c0cb8c942\n\n## Email address\n\ncenmodelscontact@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n### Goal\n\nThe main goal in creating this game is to expand the user base of Decentraland and showcase it as a place to have fun! Decentraland has many casinos and other establishments that require financial investments from players. Thus, for an ordinary user Decentraland looks like a place where everyone wants to get money from you - but it is and can be much more than that!\n\n[Demo](https://dark-dungeons.herokuapp.com)\n\n[Proposal Demo](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-de7fa02-dungeons-and-dragons-decentraland-demo/15603)\n\n[Discord Demo](https://discord.com/channels/894658869391933540/1027268770923827320)\n\nWe believe the main thing missing in Decentraland is the reasons for an ordinary user rather than an investor to join Decentraland. The main goal of our game is to become such a reason and thereby attract a large number of new users to Decentraland.\n\nThe game we want to create will be inspired by Dungeons and Dragons but won’t be its copy. We plan to fill the game with popular memes and other humorous content. There will also be cameos with famous pop culture characters. We decided to simplify some mechanics so that the game fits better into Decentraland and is easy to understand for all users regardless of their experience.\n\n### Scope\n\nThe scope of this grant proposal is ~8 months, until about the end of September 2023. Our goal is to release a game in several steps until we have, by the end of this time, a fully working v1 of our game accessible to all Decentraland users.\n\n### Game mechanics\n\nAs we mentioned, we decided to build a roleplaying experience specific to Decentraland. Some of those modifications are:\n\n●\tA session in D\\&D lasts, on average, 2-3 hours; in our game, we want to reduce the time of one session to 15-20 minutes.\n\n●\tAn AI (Artificial Intelligence) will perform the role of the gamemaster (host). Players will have a limited number of action options in a given situation.\n\n●\tPlayers will play for their avatars.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### How we see the final result:\n\n1.  1-4 players in total in one session.\n2.  Each character has characteristics (strength, charisma, etc.), specific items\n    in the inventory (crossbow, potion, etc.), and other differences.\n3.  The characters find themselves in a situation where they need to solve a problem or\n    receive a task from a non-player character in the story. (We expect that the comicality of some situations and the integration of memes and pop culture characters will have a positive impact on marketing.)\n\nFor example, a simple scenario might be that players start their journey in a tavern, and they need to find a villager-werewolf.\n\nThe main gameplay will lay in the fact that players will choose options for actions, such as: \"Inspect the tavern,\" or \"Start talking to the quiet villager”\n\nSome actions’ success gets determined by a dice roll. For example, to \"Sneak attack the guard\" you need to roll the dice to test your dexterity. The required number for success is a 10; if you get ten or a lower number - you miss, greater than 10 - you succeed.\n\nIn total, the player will change up to 5 locations during the game. The game ends when the players have completed the task, failed it, or when all the players’ characters have died.\n\nDue to the variability, the game has great replay value. Play as another character, take other companions to your team, and the game outcome will be completely different. We also plan to release new scripts regularly.\n\n### Budget Breakdown\n\n***Total: 54k***\n\n***Team Salaries:***\n\n●\t14k SDK Dev\n\n●\t12k 3D Artists\n\n●\t8k Game Designer\n\n●\t4k Game Master\n\n●\t4k 2D Artist\n\n●\t3k Sound Designer\n\n***Marketing: 4k***\n\n***Servers and infrastructure: 3k***\n\n***Land Rental for 6 months: 2k***\n\n### Tech Stack\n\nMost of the game will be built using the Decentraland SDK, but part of the infrastructure will be external. For this, we will use a custom-built backend server to store player scores, preferences, gaming history, and more.\n\n### Revenue plan / Sustainability\n\nWe plan to create some wearables and advertising banners, but making a profit is not our main goal.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nCore team\n\n○\t***Soulsinger*** - manager of the CEN studio, game designer\n\n●\tThe ideological inspirer of the project\n\n●\tOver 5 years of game development experience\n\n○     ***Alven*** - SDK Developer In Decentraland since 2020\n\n●     6 years of software development experience\n\n○\t***casuallvl*** & ***orina*** - 3d artists\n\n●\tSpecialists in 3D modelling of low-poly objects\n\n○\t***Master Eador*** - gamemaster.\n\n●\tLongtime TTRPG player\n\n●\t3 years experience as a professional gamemaster\n\n○\t***Mia*** - 2d artist\n\n●\tAn art student with experience in building game assets\n\n○\t***Alexander*** - sound designer\n\nRelevant experience\n\n●\t[Dark Dungeons Demo](https://dark-dungeons.herokuapp.com)\n\n![](https://goo.su/LsknC)\n\n●\t[CEN studio office](https://builder.decentraland.org/view/0df5d727-6bd3-4a4c-896b-07ca340bb782?realm=localhost-stub) - Demonstration of low-poly modelling\n\n![](https://lh3.google.com/u/1/d/1wY6j2lqjr1D0IMH9Da_krTcmSakIq81O=w1920-h940-iv1)\n\n●\t[Tower Master](https://www.roblox.com/games/7439601890/Tower-Master-ALPHA) - Roblox game with more than 2 million views in the last year\n\n![](https://lh3.google.com/u/1/d/1gN11P5uFovacr9Kw_nVCNzjzYCn_QV7h=w1920-h940-iv1)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### Estimated Timeline: 8 months\n\n### 2023 Q2:\n\n\\-Prototypes of the main game mechanics (action selection, dice roll, etc.)\n\n\\-Adventure scenarios and building the world\n\n\\-Concepts of characters, locations, items\n\n\\-Rough 3D models (characters, objects, etc.)\n\n***Main goal: Alpha version of the game on testnet***\n\n### 2023 Q3:\n\n\\-Development of all game mechanics based on Alpha feedback\n\n\\-All 3D models (scenery, effects, etc.)\n\n\\-Images (player cards, location backgrounds, etc.)\n\n\\-Audio (sounds of objects, etc.)\n\n***Main goal: Beta version of the game in Decentraland***\n\n### 2023 Q4:\n\n\\-Collect feedback from beta version users\n\n\\-Implement remaining features and polish the game experience\n\n\\-Marketing (payment to Twitch and YouTube channels, inviting famous bloggers to play our game)\n\n***Main goal: V1 Live***\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Should We Set Term Limits for Grant Support Squad?",
    "body": "> by 0x86edb92e217605dbecf606548e48daaf1b817da1 (MetaTrekkers)\n\n**Should We Set Term Limits for Grant Support Squad?**\n\nThe Grant Support Squad was created to guarantee the effectiveness of the Grants Program, providing support for the grantees to have successful projects. But also for holding grantees accountable for their projects, and signaling to the DAO if a vesting contract needs to be revoked, as the basic terms and conditions to take care of the DAO Treasury.\n\n**Information about Grant Support Squad**\nhttps://mirror.xyz/0x0D109CD701946D4cFE1a687b80b59Ca80732fAC5/74SS0fLMzAYS2m3noukxdsfsA3TjmOi3o6fSqolTjpQ\n\nCurrently, the members of the Grant Support Squad **do not have a defined term limit**, and their removal can only occur through a governance vote by the DAO members. To address this, we propose implementing term limits and regularly scheduled elections to allow a larger pool of skilled individuals to take part in this well-compensated position.\n\nOver time, working closely with each other can create blind spots, hindering objectivity in decision-making processes. Therefore, it is crucial to periodically rotate the members of the Decentraland Grant Squad to ensure that their work is carried out with the highest level of objectivity.\n\nBy rotating members, the Grant Support Squad can avoid the potential for organizational working relationships to influence its decision-making and ensure that each member brings a fresh perspective to the table. This approach will enable the team to benefit from the strengths of each member and ensure that their collective effort is solely focused on achieving the goals of the Decentraland community.\n\nThe absence of a set term for the Grant Support Squad in Decentraland can lead to several potential issues, including:\n\n    **1.    Lack of accountability**: Without a set term, the Grant Support Squad may not be held accountable for their actions, leading to potential abuses of power and a lack of transparency.\n\n    **2.    Lack of fresh perspectives**: Without new personnel in the Grant Support Squad, the same individuals may hold power for an extended period of time, leading to stagnation, and stifling innovation and new ideas.\n\n    **3.    Lack of trust**: The absence of term limits may lead to concerns about the impartiality of the Grant Support Squad, as members may become entrenched in their positions and less responsive to the needs of the community. This could lead to a lack of trust in the governance process and result in community members feeling disconnected from decision-making.\n\n    **4.    Reduced democratic participation**: The absence of term limits may discourage community members from participating in governance, as they may feel that their voices will not be heard or that their participation is not necessary.\n\n\\*To address these potential issues, it is essential to implement term limits for the Grant Support Squad. Doing so will increase accountability, foster fresh perspectives, and promote transparency and impartiality in decision-making. **Furthermore, setting term limits will encourage democratic participation and ensure that the governance process is accessible and inclusive for all community members.**\n\nAn excellent example of a framework that implements term limits in Decentraland's governance is the Accountability Committee selected by the Decentraland DAO Community. This committee is expected to serve for twelve (12) months, and the members can only be re-elected for one consecutive period. This proposal is available for review at\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ce104d00-7d94-11ed-8456-a323c09ee17e\n\n\\*It is important to note that implementing term limits does not mean that Grant Support Squad members should be forced to leave their positions after a specific time period. Instead, the positions must be open to the public to ensure fairness and accountability. In other words, term limits mean that after a set duration, members must reapply for their position and compete with other qualified candidates. This approach ensures that the Grant Support Squad is made up of skilled individuals who are committed to serving the Decentraland community's best interests.\n\n**It is crucial to avoid a situation where the same individuals hold power indefinitely, as this can lead to complacency, a lack of accountability, and a disconnection from the community's needs**. Therefore, term limits are an essential element of effective governance in any democratic society. They promote diversity, fresh perspectives, and a healthy turnover of leadership, ensuring that the Grant Support Squad remains responsive, accountable, and effective over the long term.\n\n(1) Yes, implement term limits for the Grant Support Squad so that members serve for a set duration and then must reapply for their position.\n\n(2) No, do not implement term limits for the Grant Support Squad, allowing members to remain in their positions indefinitely.\n\n(3) Abstain/Not\nApplicable/Undecided: The voter chooses not to vote or is unable to vote for any reason.\n\n- Yes, implement term limits \n- No, do not implement term limits \n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "body": "> by 0x1d6dbc9ab48b6c6d743d176be7ddaf0e3589ed46 (Pedro)\n\nHi, the last proposal didn't pass the voting threshold by a bit, but I believe the proposal is important and an easy-fix to a potential risk of the DAO (too much exposure to $MANA) so I'm floating it again, and I'll try my best to do a bit more of outreach to get the proposal around.\n\nNote: I am NOT affiliated with any of the spammers that will comment this proposal with their DAO management tools. If the proposal passes we will debate which specific tool to use (if any).\n\nHere is the proposal:\n\nThe DAO treasury should, in my opinion, start diversifying its assets so that the community can protect against market risk related to the $MANA token. Current treasury portfolio can be reviewed here: https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/\n\nAs can be seen, pretty much 100% of the treasury's assets are either on $MANA or $DAI (which is used mostly to paying out grants).\n\nThis is why I propose selling around 20% of the treasury's $MANA position replacing it with $ETH in a pre-announced progressive timeframe to avoid generate innecessary volatility in the $MANA token and generating a better token distribution. This can be done in the span of 12 months, on a monthly or quarterly basis.\n\n- We should diversify the DAO's treasury\n- We shouldn't\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d5bcb050-b76b-11ed-99e0-b5bb1e9f1959)**",

Since the [resignation of Eric from the DAO Committee](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/resignation-from-the-dao-committee/4705) there have only been two members responsible for the DAO’s multi-sig. The purpose of this proposal is to uphold and bring to a close the process to select a new committee member, which was first set in motion in May 2022, with a proposal calling for [Formalization of the process for adding and removing members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1).\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTobik will be appointed to the DAO Committee and added to the DAO’s multi-sig wallet.\n\n[View Tobik's Application](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569/11)\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nAdding a third member to the DAO Committee will increase the security of our multi-sig wallet, and capacity of the DAO Committee to implement DAO decisions.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nIf approved, a member of the Security Advisory Board (SAB) will create a transaction in Aragon to add Tobik’s wallet to the DAO Committee’s multi-sig. This transaction must be approved by 3 of 5 members of the SAB.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf approved, this will be the final stage in the current process to select a third DAO Committee Member. If rejected, the DAO must determine how best to proceed based on interpretation of the [Formalization of the process for adding and removing DAO Committee member](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1) proposal.

    "body": "> by 0xed0e0cb94f60f72ec94bef848f5df4cbd365af1d (InJesterr)\n\nAs we know, our current Point of Interest (POI) system allows entities to suggest points of interest on our map. Once approved, these POIs become visible on the map for all players to see. However, we could enhance this system by introducing a new feature called sub-POIs.\n\nSub-POIs would be an additional layer of detail that entities can add to their POIs. For example, if an entity suggests a Casino as a POI, they could then add sub-POIs such as the Casinos areas like: Lobby, VIP area, Roulette area & Blackjack zone. Sub-POIs would be less impactful than POIs themselves, but they would only be visible on the radar when a player is on the estate and would provide players with more information about each POI.\n\nTo ensure that sub-POIs are not abused, we could limit the number of sub-POIs that an entity can add to each POI to a maximum of 5. Additionally, sub-POIs would only be available to entities that have had their POI granted, which would prevent spamming and abuse of the system.\n\nImplementing sub-POIs would be a game-changer for our map system, as it would provide more detailed information for players and enhance their overall experience. It would also incentivize entities to submit more POIs and engage with our map system. Overall, this is a small but impactful change that we believe would be well-received by our community.\n\nI have an photoshopped image of how this would look.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/b7fqRHz.jpg\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=3da4fcc0-aee5-11ed-9b79-794d7657c819)**",

The result was that Tobik received the most amount of supporting voting power, with 60% (5,811,308) of the participating VP in favor.\n\n![|265x463](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PQURg2l6r4wEoiL-fVqVfpL5hSEb7CvQJbGMjTnfj8T7FRrwbGydX2bvcp3YBRx9dh78UZ0HEvapxCi794PHHg9r6tiweLuNhxLSoygs1cj2v9pVAgYTx\\_6OjcfZiioSvjnphDzwRGg5az6UcSgwn6w)\n\nThis Draft Proposal will serve to confirm Tobik as the winner, and if it gets approved, it will be followed by a Binding Governance Proposal to ratify the decision and formally appoint the Member-Select to the DAO Committee.\n\nIn the event that subsequent proposals fail to pass, DAO operators will focus on formalizing the pathway for adding and/or removing members to committees within our Governance dApp, which will include the process for electing new members to the DAO Committee.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO Committee should be composed of 3 members elected by the Community to improve security.  Since Mr Eric resigned early last year, [@HPrivakos](https://forum.decentraland.org/u/hprivakos) and [@Yemel](https://forum.decentraland.org/u/yemel) have been serving alone.\n\n*   [Resignation of Eric to the DAO Committee](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/resignation-from-the-dao-committee/4705)\n*   [Formalization of the process for adding and removing members ](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)\n*   [Formalization of compensation for committee members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fa6a3040-338a-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8)\n*   [Open Call for new committee members](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569/2)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis is a voting to confirm Tobik as the applicant with the most amount of voting power in favour to become a DAO Committee Member. →[View Tobik's Application](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569/11)←\n\nHistorical Context:\n\nThe [Formal Process for Adding/Removing DAO Committee Members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5fd09520-ae73-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231) laid out a three stage process for selecting a new DAO Committee Member. This includes: 1) The open application period; 2) Committee interviews; and 3) Final vote - by ranked choice or individual proposals for each applicant.\n\nGiven Ranked-Choice Voting has not yet been approved or implemented as a voting modality in the Governance dApp, the DAO Committee created 5 separate Governance Proposals, one for each candidate: [AwedJob](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b36f7c10-8153-11ed-8fa2-17dd3f32db26), [Champ](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=200f1a10-8154-11ed-8fa2-17dd3f32db26), [Martriay](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=31bf25c0-8154-11ed-8fa2-17dd3f32db26), [Szjanko](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e64e1920-8153-11ed-8fa2-17dd3f32db26), and [Tobik](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0a4910f0-8154-11ed-8fa2-17dd3f32db26). At the end of the voting period, despite reaching the participation threshold, none of the proposals passed, and a new candidate was not selected - with community members calling for mechanisms to better understand each candidate's background and skills, and reframing the selection process into a single proposal, including all five candidates. This would ensure that the community was equipped to make an informed decision, and that DAO Members could only vote for one of the five candidates.\n\nIn response to these sentiments, a [specific channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/894658869391933540/1063091432879042691) was opened in the Decentraland DAO Discord for asynchronous communications with candidates, a synchronous session with the five candidates was held during the [most recent Town Hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-j9iqA\\_2fY) on January 26, 2023, and the above poll was put together by the DAO Facilitation upon DAO Committee request.\n\nOn February 6, 2023, a [Pre-Proposal Poll](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=93f5cb90-a67f-11ed-a669-05ba4b332980) was submitted as a mechanism to select between the 5 candidates in a single-choice voting round. With the voting closed on February 11, 2023, the result was that Tobik received the most amount of supporting voting power, with 60% (5,811,308) of the participating VP in favor.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOver the past year, the DAO Committee has been proven essential for the regular operations of the DAO. Adding a new member should improve the security and decentralization of the DAO.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=49ef5010-ad51-11ed-9b79-794d7657c819)**",

    "title": "Should DAO proposals have a pre-defined 'Abstain' voting option?",
    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Should DAO proposals have a pre-defined 'Abstain' voting option?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2d146330-9e70-11ed-868f-0d503a0e5b7e)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal is about adding an abstain predefined option to the DAO's voting system. This would allow members to indicate that they do not wish to vote either for or against a proposal.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nAdding an Abstain voting option would allow DAO members the option to abstain from voting on proposals, allowing them to express a neutral position rather than being forced to vote for or against a proposal. Also useful in cases where members have already voted and want to withdraw their vote without having to take a stance.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, there is no way for people who have already voted on a proposal to take their VP out of the defining equation. If they voted YES, they can keep their vote or change it to NO. Especially for critical proposals, during the voting period, a message on Discord or the forum, a tweet, a conversation with another DAO member, a Town Hall, or your thought process could change your stance on a matter. Having an abstain option would allow members to keep being involved in the governance process without having to necessarily take a stance on the final outcome.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAdding an abstain predefined option to the DAO's voting system (Similar to how the Invalid Question/Options currently work for Polls), would allow members to indicate that they do not wish to vote either for or against a proposal. This option would be available alongside the existing options of \"Yes\" and \"No\". This option will be added only for proposals with Yes/No options (Not applicable to Pre-proposal Polls)\n\n### Implementation\n\n*   The abstain option will be added to the DAO's Snapshot space and the Governance dApp and will be available to all members in Yes/No proposals (POIs, Catalyst Node, Name Ban, Grant Request, Linked Wearables Registry, Draft Proposal, and Governance Proposal).\n*   The abstain option will be counted separately from the \"for\" and \"against\" votes, and will not affect the outcome of the vote.\n*   A summary of the abstain votes will be included in the results of the vote, along with the total number of \"for,\" \"against,\" and abstain votes.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\n*   Users will be able to change their minds while a proposal is open and change their votes to a neutral option instead of voting for the opposite one.\n*   Potentially more VP will be participating in DAO Proposals. Showing up is important, and especially at this stage of our DAO, it is crucial to give users the option to acknowledge a proposal without necessarily having a stance on the topic.\n    \\-This could be also relevant if in the future the DAO decides to change how the VP Thresholds work. At the moment the VP Threshold is only applied to the winning option, so for a proposal to be considered 'Passed', it needs to accumulate a certain amount of VP on the 'Yes', and also should have the simple majority of the participating votes. Another way of thinking about the Thresholds would be similar to the concept of Quorum in traditional parliamentary voting mechanisms where the total amount of votes are counted for the Acceptance Threshold/Quorum and then, the winning option must accumulate the simple majority of the participating votes.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nA predefined 'Abstain' voting option will be added in our Snapshot space to every proposal that does not allow for custom answers (Currently, only Pre-proposal Polls allow for custom answers so this option will be added to Draft, Governance, POIs, Catalyst, Name Bans, Grant Requests, and Linked Wearables).\nIf the  'Abstain' option accumulates more VP than the Yes/No option, the proposal will be considered 'Rejected' by the community.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### Benefits\n\n*   Allows members to express a neutral position on a proposal, rather than feeling forced to take a stance.\n*   Provides a more accurate representation of member opinions, as it allows those who are unsure or neutral to make their views known.\n*   Increases the legitimacy of the voting process and its engagement levels, as it allows all members to fully participate without feeling pressure to take a position they may not fully agree with.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4ceeb900-ac83-11ed-ac8c-716656805a96)**",

The collection was generated with more than 500 unique wearable items, each created from Ha Jung-Woo's original art works. The collection features the unique style of Ha Jung Woo’s artwork in the form of NFTs that embodies the beauty and diversity of what Supernormal stands for. Because there is a very limited supply of only 978 NFTs, you will be provided with a rare opportunity of enjoying multiple linked wearable items that allows your Decentraland avatars to look like your Ha Jung-Woo X SuperNormal PFP.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nFashion allows people to express themselves and their identities without saying a word.\nOur mission is to keep generating digital wearables so that Decentraland players can enjoy beautiful and unique wearables that we will continuously be creating.\n\nAvant Garde is increasing partnerships with various artists and fashion brands to generate more digital wearables to present more variations of wearable items. We hope Decentraland will become our main stage for releasing upcoming collections as well.\n\nWe will never stop until people can fully express themselves in metaverse games.

    "title": "[Resubmission] Bidding and Tendering Flow",
    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (LordLike)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Bidding and Tendering Flow](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a44efb60-7d62-11ed-8456-a323c09ee17e)\n\n## Summary\n\nA process for the DAO to agree and allocate resources to strategic projects, make a public call for bids, and later decide on the best provider for the job.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis is not a replacement for the Grant Program, but instead a process to incubate and generate competing grant requests for a previously defined project.\n\nThe Tendering process should be implemented as a new proposal flow, similar to the governance process. It starts with a basic community signaling about the project, and later formalizes the requirements in a Tender Proposal. Once approved, bids for the project will be received over a period of time and the winner is decided by a community vote.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAn important goal is to enable any member of the community to propose a project without the requirement of being the main executor of it.\n\nThe process starts with building consensus around the end goal of the project by using a customer-centric approach. The initial Pitch Proposal should address questions about the target customer, and the problem it solves, and any doubts about how it should work. Here, the audience of the proposal is the customer that will use the product.\n\nThe second step is to escalate the project idea into a Tender Proposal, including any project requirements, stakeholders, and details about the public tender. The co-authors of the proposal should include representatives of the stakeholder groups signaling their support. Here, the audience of the proposal is a company or freelancer that might submit a bid to build the project.\n\nThe process aims to generate more business opportunities for studios and freelancers looking to work for the DAO. Many talented teams are eager to work but lack the context of what needs to be done.\n\nFinally, this process allows the DAO to allocate its budget in a transparent and efficient manner, by allowing the community to compare offers and vote for the most suitable one.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proposal Flow\n\nA new flow of proposal categories should be added to the Governance dApp.\n\n**1. Pitch Proposal**\n\n*   Any member of the community can send a pitch proposal to test community sentiment.\n*   The proposal should include a product’s name, intended customer, the problem the product solves, benefits to the customer, a call to action telling the customer how to take advantage of the product right away, a FAQ answering the business or tactical questions about building the product.\n*   Duration 10 days and 2M VP threshold.\n*   Minimum required VP to submit a pitch proposal: 100 VP.\n\n**2. Tender Proposal**\n\n*   Passed Pitch Proposals can be promoted to Tender Proposals by any community member.\n*   The proposal should include a summary, specification, deliverables, deadlines, required skills, stakeholders, and any bidding submission details.\n*   Duration 14 days and 4M VP threshold.\n*   Minimum required VP to submit a tender proposal: 2,500 VP.\n\n**3. Bid Proposal**\n\n*   A passed Tender Proposal opens the bidding process for third parties.\n*   The bid should include budget, project duration, starting date, deliverables, roadmap, personnel, beneficiary address, and email address.\n*   Bid details will be kept confidential by the governance app until the submission period is over.\n*   The bidding period should last *at least* 2 weeks.\n\n**4. Selection Proposal**\n\n*   All bids received will be revealed at the same time and put up for a community vote for 2 weeks. Each bid will need to collect at least the VP threshold of the requested budget to be considered passed.\n*   The passed bid with VP simple majority will be considered the winner. The voting process should implement Snapshot’s  [ranked or weighted voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types#ranked-choice-voting-instant-runoff-voting).\n\n### Guidelines\n\nThe following articles should be included in Decentraland’s documentation for future reference.\n\n1.  Placing a bid implies acceptance of an offer in its entirety, including all of its requirements. If the bid is selected, upon initial payment or initial work of the bid, all elements are considered met to consider this a binding contract.\n\n2.  Studios or freelancers may formulate proposals individually or in the form of a partnership as long as they fulfill all requirements and must be included as co-authors and personnel.\n\n3.  The economic proposal must be presented in USD dollars. It will be paid in stablecoins using the vesting contract subject to the conditions of the Grants Program.\n\n4.  Bid proposals that do not cover the full project will be rejected.\n\n5.  Deliveries should be in the form and within the deadlines expressed in the Tender Document, otherwise bids will be rejected.\n\n6.  The community may ask the bidders on the grant proposals to provide complementary information about the company or the proposed solution.\n\n7.  The winning bid will be converted into an enacted grant, following the same policies that govern the Grant’s Program.\n\n8.  In the event that there’s only one valid bid available, a second call should be made. At least two options should be available to decide.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe Bidding and Tendering Flow has the potential to bring about significant changes within the Decentraland community, depending on a range of factors.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, the proposal is implemented smoothly, allowing the Decentraland DAO to identify and allocate resources to strategic projects in a transparent and efficient manner. This could lead to increased satisfaction and trust within the community, as well as potentially attract new talent and businesses to work with the organization.\n\nHowever, it is possible that there may be some initial challenges with the implementation of the proposal, which could be addressed through updates and additional guidelines or training.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the proposal is not implemented successfully, leading to a lack of progress on important projects, decreased satisfaction within the community, and potentially a loss of trust in the DAO's decision-making processes.\n\nIt is worth noting that this proposal will co-exist with the Grants Program, and a new governance proposal aligning both systems may be developed in the future.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe Governance Squad should implement the following changes:\n\n*   Update Decentraland documentation with detailed requirements.\n*   Create a submission form for Pitches, Tenders, and Bids.\n*   Create a voting view for Pitch, Tender, and Selection proposals.\n*   Support a new voting system (ranked voting) to pick among bids.\n\nThese changes are all feasible and can be developed in parts, starting with the Pitch proposal, followed by the Tender and Bidding Part, and finally with the Selection proposal.\n\nThe Grant Support Squad should be responsible for measuring performance metrics for each project and overviewing its roadmap progress. A project should be revoked if such performance metrics are poor or fails to meet any of the requirements.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Bidding and Tendering process is a method to select the most suitable service provider or supplier, by comparing proposals against specific criteria. This system encourages fairness and transparency of opportunities, as well as the effectiveness of funds allocation.\n\nThe proposed Bidding and Tendering approach aim to separate the process of deciding what needs to be done, from the decision of who should make it happen. The Pitch and FAQ it’s a good method to align the community on the final goal of the project, it can be the guide during the development process and the final success evaluation.\n\nIn order to have an effective bidding process it’s important to get many competitive offers from different suppliers. This will require an active effort from the community and DAO core units to make sure the Tender Proposal reaches as many studios as possible.\n\nThe Grant Program and the Tender and Bidding system will coexist, the first being the foundational layer for the second one. Eventually, the community will form some sort of criteria regarding which projects should go directly to the Grant Program and which ones deserve to go through the Tender and Bidding process.\n\nThe proposed scheme aims to be the minimum viable framework to test this idea. Future improvements might involve incentivizing stakeholders to craft tender proposals and oversight the progress of the project. Also delegating to a committee the decision of which bid is the winner might be more effective than a community vote. But for this stage, it’s better to start simple and iterate later using real-world experience.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bb921ab0-abdd-11ed-8dfe-4ff0ad4dfd32)**",

District Leader now claims ownership of over 2,000 (!) Land. This, we argue, goes against the rationale and ethos of Decentraland and its community.\n\nMore information, including a timeline and a petition can be found:\n\nhttps://realdistrictx.medium.com/district-x-on-decentraland-a8e10279e874\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/decentraland-leadership-petition-to-free-and-democratise-district-x-in-decentraland-207f0677-85b0-42aa-ba56-6a6d1cc1585b\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe propose that District X contributors should be given the opportunity to present their case to the DAO in order to regain decentralised, accountable and democratic control of the District. Contributors should be returned the rightful ownership of their Land, which, after all, they contributed to make the District possible in the first place. If approved, Land ownership should be transferred back to Contributors. We seek advice on two possible resolutions: complete ownership or a royalty system.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nDCL developers can implement it.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLet the DAO community decide what to do with it.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=486cf0e0-aa53-11ed-8dfe-4ff0ad4dfd32)**",

    "body": "> by 0x5985eb4a8e0e1f7bca9cc0d7ae81c2943fb205bd (helpimstreaming)\n\nFor logarithmic (or any function of VP) to work without the spreading of VP. We need a locking in/burning system where your VP from names, mana and land have to be locked into your wallet to be able to function as VP. Then the only way to move would be delegation at a reduced rate (x0.25) or unlocking it from VP. This stops delegation of 1000VP to 1000 accounts at a 1:1 ratio which breaks the logarithmic idea. We would also see VP assets moved over a few accounts to bypass this, a way to deal with that would be a small cool down on VP when unlocked and moved. You could also have the VP amount at a x0.25 rate for the first 3 months of a an account owning and locking in a newly acquired VP asset. Also maybe repercussions of VP time out when it has been seen that asset spreading is happening for the sake of voting.\n\nI believe if it's done like this it will round off nicely.\n1k = 1k VP\n10k = 10k VP\n100k = 90k VP\\\n1m = 250k VP\n\nWith logarithmic VP your one mana would always equal one VP no matter where it’s gained from and it only comes into real effect just below acquiring 100k mana. This means everyday players whose main intentions are experiencing Decentraland are not affected and if you wanted more mana on more accounts then it comes with a cost of buying fresh mana.\n\nJust putting it out there for someone to pick up down the line.\n\nSo what you think? bit of a mess ay.

    "title": "UPDATE: LAND INTEGRITY ADVISORY BOARD + \"LIAB\" LEAD",
    "body": "> by 0xdcdc472630a06ac647d17e793c22fd46c9153505\n\nHi all,\n\nThis is a follow up to the proposal I made last week.  I apologize for the confusion last time as I had written \"Community Feedback\" for both options hoping to get feed back before a vote.\n\nI've incorporated additional comments and made clearer that this proposal is only for the creation of a Land Integrity Advisory Board and a LIAB Lead.  The ideas in the proposal are just draft ideas that have been discussed.  Feel free to comment on those proposals in the comments section though if you wish.  But the genesis of this proposal is to make sure that land owners' interests are being adequately considered at the DAO level and hopefully the Foundation level as well.  I think having a point person who can disseminate info to the community that has been vetted by a LIAB will give land owners some comfort.\n\nI am nominating myself for the role of LIAB Lead.  If anyone would like to interview me for that role and/or nominate themselves for the role that is completely reasonable.\n\nHopefully the link works this time:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-84vq5xMP9VvIdgQGKFDJ0rscUiWzJna-nxA8DP7\\_Fs/edit?usp=sharing\n\n- This is a good idea\n- This is a bad idea \n- I have questions (please ask in comments)\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=80061690-a994-11ed-8dfe-4ff0ad4dfd32)**",

    "body": "> by 0x1d6dbc9ab48b6c6d743d176be7ddaf0e3589ed46 (Pedro)\n\nThe DAO treasury should, in my opinion, start diversifying its assets so that the community can protect against market risk related to the $MANA token. Current treasury portfolio can be reviewed here: https://governance.decentraland.org/transparency/\n\nAs can be seen, pretty much 100% of the treasury's assets are either on $MANA or $DAI (which is used mostly to paying out grants).\n\nThis is why I propose selling around 20% of the treasury's $MANA position replacing it with $ETH in a pre-announced progressive timeframe to avoid generate innecessary volatility in the $MANA token and generating a better token distribution. This can be done in the span of 12 months, on a monthly or quarterly basis.\n\n- We should diversify the DAO's treasury\n- We shouldn't\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fe5948e0-a977-11ed-8dfe-4ff0ad4dfd32)**",

    "title": "Delegate the Reference Client roadmap to the Decentraland Foundation",
    "body": "> by 0x8dd060ad7f867ad890490fd87657c1b7e63c622f (Jungle)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Delegate the Reference Client roadmap to the Decentraland Foundation](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b8933dc0-9ce3-11ed-ae61-5f6dd0bf8358)\n\n## Summary\n\nShould the Decentraland DAO delegate the responsibility of developing and executing the roadmap for the Reference Client to the Foundation?\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Reference Client (the app at play.decentraland.org) is currently the most widely used Decentraland client. Right now, the Decentraland Foundation is the main contributor to the Reference Client’s open source code base, but given the DAO’s ownership of the client (and the need to have the DAO approve major changes), the Foundation is hindered in how quickly and effectively it can develop new features and improvements.\n\nTo overcome this hurdle, the Foundation is suggesting that the DAO delegate the development and maintenance of the Reference Client to the Foundation. This delegation would be reviewed and renewed every 12 months.\n\nThis delegation would empower the Foundation to:\n\n*   Communicate and execute a solid roadmap both for community developers and users\n*   Build a richer feature set (e.g. better in-world navigation, social interaction, and content moderation tools)\n*   Ensure that the client is faster and more stable\n*   Improve the quality and performance of the client’s graphics\n*   Improve the client’s ability to support more concurrent users\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nTo better understand the scope of this proposed delegation and the extent of it’s impact on the broader platform, it’s important to define some terms:\n\n### The “DAO”\n\nThe DAO was created to help the community direct the development of Decentraland’s policies, infrastructure, content moderation, and smart contracts. The DAO owns the smart contracts for Decentraland’s digital assets (like LAND, Names, Wearables, etc.), so any changes made to those contracts must be approved by the DAO. Furthermore, platform-impacting decisions or changes to Decentraland’s codebase (i.e. decisions that impact the entire Decentraland community, like strategic decisions for the client) must be approved by the DAO.\n\n### The “Decentraland Foundation”\n\nThe Foundation is a non-profit organization that was formed to help protect the intellectual property of the Decentraland brand (something that the DAO lacks the legal status to do). The Foundation was also tasked with supporting the decentralization of the platform alongside the community.\n\n### The “Decentraland Stack”\n\nDecentraland is made up of a complex “stack” of different smart contracts, protocols, and applications. Together, they make up the Decentraland Platform. Generally speaking, the different decentralized layers can defined as:\n\n1.  The **smart contracts** that make Decentraland’s scarce digital assets (like LAND, Estates, Wearables, Names, etc) possible.\n2.  The **Catalyst software** used to run the distributed network of servers that host and provide content to users.\n3.  The **software development** kit that people use to build content for Decentraland’s virtual world.\n4.  **dApps like the Builder** that allow people to create and arrange content for Decentraland’s virtual world without writing code.\n5.  **dApps like the Marketplace** that allow people to manage and exchange Decentraland’s digital assets.\n6.  **Clients** that allow users to interact with the content of Decentraland. Decentraland clients are like web browsers (e.g. Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox) in that they all provide access to the same network and information, but are not the web itself. In 2022, this also includes the PC and Mac clients, currently in beta and available to download from https://decentraland.org/download.\n\n### The “Reference Client”\n\nThe Decentraland Reference Client discussed in this proposal is the web based app and the PC and Mac clients that allow people to access and interact with content and other users within Decentraland’s virtual world. This application sits at the top of the Decentraland Stack.\n\nIt’s helpful to remember that the Reference Client does not constitute the entire Decentraland Platform, that it is just one alternative for accessing the Decentraland Platform, that anyone can develop a customized client, and that the roadmap discussed in this proposal for the Reference Client can’t dictate changes to any other components of the platform—those must still be approved by the DAO on a case by case basis.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n#### Duration and renewal of the delegation\n\nThe DAO would delegate to the Foundation the responsibility of developing and maintaining the Reference Client for a period of 12 months, according to a roadmap approved by the DAO on a biannual schedule. The Foundation will be responsible for presenting and delivering a product roadmap for 2023.\n\nThe roadmap will be prioritized in collaboration with the DAO by implementing a mechanism for proposing and signaling support on new initiative.\n\n#### Ideation and validation for the roadmap\n\nThe DAO will have a clear path to contribute ideas and requests to the roadmap. This could take the form of a new polling category within the DAO, specific to client feature requests and suggestions. These proposals could then be voted on by the community, with accepted suggestions being passed to the Foundation for inclusion in the next iteration of the product roadmap.\n\n#### Deviations from the roadmap\n\nThe Foundation would be able to reasonably depart from the roadmap to make full use of the Foundation’s familiarity with the competitive market, Decentraland’s user base, and regulatory requirements\n\n#### Funding development\n\nFunds to develop the Reference Client (e.g. payroll for developers) would still be provided by the Foundation, not the DAO.\n\n#### Termination of the delegation\n\nThe DAO may choose at any time to revoke this delegation in favor of giving it to another entity.\n\n#### Limits of the delegation\n\nThe delegation is limited to the Reference Client and does not allow the Foundation to make changes to other areas of the Decentraland platform; any such changes must pass through a vote in the DAO.\n\n### Rationale\n\n*   The Reference Client is a complex application that is relevant to the continued development of the platform.\n*   The development life cycle for something as complex as the client requires countless technical and strategic decisions to be made on a daily basis\n*   Given the time it takes to write proposals and pass them through the DAO, it would be extremely impractical to have the DAO weigh in on each of these decisions\n*   So, it’s clear that in order to develop the client at a speed sufficient to compete with other metaverse projects, at least some level of formal delegation is needed\n*   The Foundation is the best candidate to receive this delegation given its proximity to the platform, its resources, and its knowledge of the market and the Decentraland community\n*   The suggested delegation would provide the Foundation with the autonomy needed to execute quickly, while still being subject to the relevant decisions, directions, and control of the DAO\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe project is currently in a state of asymmetry in terms of context/resources/contributions between the Foundation and the community. The Foundation has learned a lot over the last two years of delegation by being a key contributor to the transformation of the vision into tangible artifacts and ecosystem products. All of these insights are being considered for the next cycle, with strategies outlined in the document on how to improve rapport and collaboration with the Decentraland community.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe Foundation will continue to increase the collaboration spaces for community conversation and co-creation by organizing user research/testing sessions, product sessions, technical AMAs, and IRL meetups. We will continue to look for ways to be transparent and communicative about the major milestones the product team is working towards during the year, and we will keep updating the information as it becomes available. Foundation's guiding principle is to serve the Decentraland community and be guided by their needs and advisory. We are dedicated to making decisions that serve the best interests of the community, with no other motivation driving us forward.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### Transparency and reporting\n\nThe Foundation is working on finding new ways of working that would improve the transparency of its roadmap plans, scope, ongoing work, and updates on results.\n\nIn order to enable two-way communication and create more opportunities for questions and answers, the Foundation has already announced that it will hold regular (approximately monthly) technical AMA sessions with the community. They are also considering additionally holding more general AMA sessions in order to cover all the areas in which the community may have questions and concerns. These sessions could potentially take place on a quarterly basis.\n\nLastly, the Foundation is looking into establishing more public data sources to easily provide data to the public that has previously only been for internal use.\n\n### The Decentraland Foundation’s mission statement:\n\nDecentraland’s goal is to be a fun and entertaining platform with a thriving community that educates and onboards people to the philosophies and tech of Web3 while empowering Creators in the hope that, when the masses realize why decentralization is important, a viable option will be available and the next iteration of the internet won’t be monopolized by a handful of corporations.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f33d4c40-a972-11ed-8dfe-4ff0ad4dfd32)**",

This cost is seen as a barrier to entry for many creators, particularly small-scale creators, investors, and collectors, hindering the growth and diversity of content on the platform. The proposal aims to reduce the cost to a reasonable amount that the Decentraland community feels is appropriate, with a suggestion of reducing it to $25. This change would make the platform more accessible and encourage a wider range of creators to participate, leading to a more diverse and engaging user experience.\n\nThe reduction in the cost of publishing wearables aligns with Decentraland's mission of being an open and accessible platform for all creators and users.\n\nThe Decentraland community is encouraged to support this proposal and work together to create a more inclusive and thriving ecosystem.\n\n- yes\n- no\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=33556c90-a969-11ed-8dfe-4ff0ad4dfd32)**",

To achieve this, the committee may need to gather and analyze various financial data, such as financial statements, budgets, and other reports.\n\nHaving a detailed financial model would benefit Decentraland as it would serve as a reference for operating decisions, such as revenue, expenses etc. This committee is crucial to driving forward important strategic initiatives, such as treasury diversification, data and analytics transparency, and expense reporting and management.\n\nThe tasks of the finance committee may include:\n\n*   Treasury diversification to ensure that the DAO has enough stablecoins to fund operations in the event of a MANA price drop\n\n*   Providing a financial model and strategy, and making relevant recommendations to the DAO\n\n*   Providing reports on DAO's financial performance, including platform financial statistics, treasury performance, expenses details, and implications on the long-term financial forecast\n\n*   Maintaining, evaluating, and updating a living business operating model and financial projections to inform and drive strategic decision-making, such as expense management, treasury diversification, token swaps, and organic growth initiatives\n\n*   Leading conversations and negotiations in financial transactions engaged in by the DAO, such as grants and token swaps\n\n*   Approving and periodically reviewing the DAO's annual budget and ensuring that funds are being expended for their intended purpose\n\n*   Leading efforts and serving as the team liaison with the community regarding treasury management and diversification and risk management\n\n*   Conducting ad-hoc financial analysis at the request of committees, squads, and the community to assist in financial decision-making\n\n*   Conducting a financial audit at the request of committees, squads, and the community\n\n*   Monitoring financial risk exposures and taking steps to control them, and flagging potential financial problems.\n\nThis proposal aims to provide a starting point for the community to come together and reach consensus on the need for this committee, its name, structure and exact responsibilities.\n\nYes: DAO should have a Finance Committee.\n\nNo: Leave as is.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=84bd3940-a8d4-11ed-8dfe-4ff0ad4dfd32)**",

By implementing term limits and regularly scheduled elections, a larger pool of skilled individuals will have the opportunity to take part in this well-compensated position.\n\nInitially, elections for the committee were conducted through polls. However, as the DAO continues to grow and mature with increasing voting power, it may be necessary to raise the threshold for these elections.\n\nIn conclusion, setting a term limit for Wearables Curation Committee members and regularly scheduling elections for the committee would be a positive move for the Decentraland community, promoting democratic engagement and introducing fresh perspectives.\n\nA model to follow is the Accountability Committee, which is in office for twelve months and can only be re-elected for one consecutive term.\n\nThis proposal aims to address this issue and provide a starting point for the community to come together and further clarify and reach consensus on the ideal term length.\n\nYes: Set a duration period for Wearables Curation Committee members\n\nNo: Leave as is.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0b577640-a8bd-11ed-8dfe-4ff0ad4dfd32)**",

    "body": "> by 0x5b5cc427c1d81db4f94de4d51d85ce122d63e244 (Fehz)\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nThis poll is a continuation of the [Formal Process for Adding/Removing DAO Committee Members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5fd09520-ae73-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231), to elect a new Committee Member from the 5 selected DAO Committee Applicants. It is the first of three stages that will lead to the confirmation and appointment of a new DAO Committee Member.\n\n**ABSTRACT**\n\nThe DAO needs to appoint 1 new member to the DAO Committee in order to reach the initial setup of 2-of-3 signers.\n\nIn accordance with the process established for adding/removing DAO Committee Members, an [Open Call for Candidates](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569/2) was published. The Open Call received 10 submissions. Two withdrew from the process. Five were selected by existing DAO Committee members, following an interview process and ranking of the candidates using a system based on Trust, Technical Knowledge, Timezone, and DAO Participation.\n\nThis Pre-Proposal Poll will serve as the mechanism to select between the 5 candidates in a single-choice voting round.\n\nIt will be followed by a Draft Proposal to confirm the winner, and a Binding Governance Proposal to ratify the decision and formally appoint the Member-Select to the DAO Committee.\n\n**SPECIFICATION**\n\nThis is a single-choice vote between five DAO Committee Applicants. The Applicant with the most amount of supporting voting power will be advanced to a Draft Proposal for confirmation.\n\nThe full application for each candidate as well as a short excerpt on why they are applying for the role, are included below:\n\n*   [AwedJob](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569/6): “\\[I am applying] To provide my humanizing energy to this position which is more than a series of grant management duties. There are people connecting wallets to the vesting contracts. Living, breathing, Decentralites log into the world and develop friendships through shared experiences. Experiences made possible and enriched by grants provided via the DCL DAO. I would like to be a liaison between community members and the stack of rules governing DCL. I am patient, considerate, and attentive. As an educator with over seven years of experience I can also be a “warm demander”.\n\n*   [Champ](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569/8): “I see Decentraland as the most honest attempt to create a truly decentralized virtual world.

I think it is very important that we ensure that the decentralized metaverse is the one that will gain mainstream adoption. Having 5+ years of experience in investing and researching in the cryptocurrency/blockchain field, I think I have gained valuable knowledge that will help with Decentralands governance and proposal discussions/votes.”\n\n*   [Tobik](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569/11): There are many reasons \\[why I am applying], but I think this job is a perfect opportunity to complement it with what I already do, which is documenting [Decentraland at Unversed](https://unversed.org).

    "title": "New Wearable Category: Hands",
    "body": "> by 0x56469159d91eb810dce34dd13ec4ed8194bca7be (NikkiFuego)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[New Wearable Category: Hands](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=33d8c100-8ec8-11ed-aae5-394e6c1c2226)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis draft aims to introduce a new and highly desired Wearable Category: Hands! This has been a category that the community has been talking about for nearly a year now. It passed the Poll stage with 192 Yes votes and 1.6M VP.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nCurrently, we see the wearable accessory categories flooded with hand accessories. This dilutes the accessory categories greatly and overall doesn't feel like good quality of the use of those categories. This draft's goal is to solve that problem by introducing a proper category for hand accessories/items.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe addition of a Hands wearable submission category to the platform would be important for a number of reasons. First, it would allow content creators to submit and showcase their creations. Currently, creators must fit their hand-related wearables into existing categories, which may not always accurately reflect the true nature of their work. By adding a new category, creators would have a more specific and relevant place to showcase their creations, which could lead to increased visibility and potential sales.\n\nSecond, a Hands wearable submission category would also allow the Decentraland platform to accommodate a wider range of wearables and potentially attract a larger user base. This could be particularly beneficial for creators who are working on innovative or niche wearables that do not fit neatly into existing categories. By giving these creators a dedicated space to showcase their work, Decentraland could become a more diverse and dynamic platform.\n\nThe addition of a new wearable submission category would be an important step for the Decentraland platform, as it would allow for greater creativity and innovation from content creators and a more immersive and dynamic experience for users. This also allows for a revenue generation opportunity. The amount of wearables that can be made for a Hands category is endless.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**We would propose the following parameters/guidelines for curation on the new category:**\n\n*   1000 tri limit (Identical to Feet Category) **AMENDED**\n*   2 materials 2 textures limit. All textures must be square. (Identical to Feet Category)\n*   All pre-existing Upper-Body wearables should automatically hide the Hands category.\n*   Creators should be able to update their existing Upper-Body wearables as needed to accommodate this change.\n*   Skins should automatically hide Hand Category. (Identical to Feet Category)\n*   A mass email should be sent to every wearable creator (they have to submit an email upon publishing) to let them know about the change so that creators who have pre-existing wearables that include hand accessories (IE: Tiara, Top-Head, Earring, etc) can update their wearable as needed.\n\n**We would propose the following changes to the Wearable Docs:**\n\n*   The Decentraland Avatar System: Body Shape, Head, Upper Body, **Hands**, Lower Body, Feet.\n*   Let’s see those hands! All gloves, rings, handbags, weapons, etc. are applied to the hands, not the upper body. ![Img](https://i.imgur.com/NU51Go6.png)\n*   Swapping out a new Upper Body image: ![Img](https://i.imgur.com/IMxBcuE.png)\n*   Update in Wearable Categories section under Skin: Skin: Replaces the entire avatar (head, upper body, **hands**, lower body and feet except accessories). As well as adding Hands to the list of Categories below Upper_Body.\n*   New image for Upper Body, Lower Body, and Feet section: ![Img](https://i.imgur.com/fUZeK8B.png)\n*   New addition to the Skin Weighting list: Right Hand and Left Hand Bones: for the hand and upper body’s intersecting vertices.\n\nAs well as adding a new Backpack Icon in the wearable section: ![Img](https://i.imgur.com/JCzsIF8.png)\n\n**Provided Resources**\n\n*   Doki and I have curated a Blender resource file that comes preloaded with examples of new avatars with the Hands separated and caps filled. Ideally replacing the currently pre-existing open source file for avatars.\n*   Doki and I would also like to volunteer our 3D Modeling services **for free** to the foundation to help curate default hand wearables for the community to introduce the new category.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nI have spoken in lengthy detail with members of the Explorer Team and they have approved this proposal and the integration process proposed. We came to an agreement that a 1,000 tri limit was going to be more conducive to the performance of the platform.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n**As mentioned above, the integration process will be as followed:**\n\n*   All pre-existing Upper-Body wearables will keep the original hands that they were published with and hide the new Hands category. This is to ensure good integrity with designs and not allow for old hands to overlap with new hands.\n*   Those who have previously published Upper-Body wearables will have the option to update their wearable and remove the original hands and unhide the new Hands category.\n*   New Hands category will be added to the category list for publication and to the Docs page with the outlined parameters above.\n*   New sorting category in both Marketplace and Backpack for Hands category.\n*   Open-source blender file with new default avatar modified to accommodate the new Hands category.\n*   Hands meshes will have enclosed caps on the wrist similar to Upper-Body and Lower Body waistlines.\n*   New Upper-Body open-source mesh will have enclosed caps on the wrists to accommodate the new Hands category.\n*   Skin category will hide the new Hands category by default.\n*   Doki and I will create a few Default Hands wearables for the foundation to integrate into the backpack.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the addition of a new Hands wearable submission category to the Decentraland platform would benefit the community, the platform, and wearable creators in various ways. For the community, it would provide a more immersive and dynamic experience as they would have access to a wider range of wearables to choose from. For the Decentraland platform, it could lead to increased revenue through publishing fees and higher levels of user engagement. And for wearable creators, it would provide a more specific and relevant place to showcase their Hand creations, which could lead to increased visibility and potential sales. All in all, the addition of a new Hands wearable submission category would be a positive development for all parties involved and would help to create a more vibrant and dynamic virtual world.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=eba005b0-a5b5-11ed-a669-05ba4b332980)**",

    "title": "Should the DAO implement a mechanism to delegate VP to multiple wallets?",
    "body": "> by 0x1e93e534c5e26b01ed242410b43ae23dd0faa52b (ile)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should the DAO implement a mechanism to delegate VP to multiple wallets?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9d698ea0-9108-11ed-aae5-394e6c1c2226)\n\n## Summary\n\nLets encourage more VP delegation in our DAO by making it easier and less expensive!\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nCurrently, voting power delegation in our DAO is limited to delegating to a single wallet address. That means that if a wallet has 1000VP, it can only delegate the totality of that VP to another address. At the moment, the walkaround to delegate VP to multiple users is first to transfer your tokens to multiple wallets and then delegate VP from each one of those wallets. This increases the cost of delegation due to the need for multiple transactions (At least one for transferring tokens and another one to delegate).\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nFor the past three months I've been experimenting with delegating VP to the top monthly voter and explorer. I would like to expand this program to include the top 5 monthly voters and explorers but right now it's too much hassle to manage and move mana between 10 separate wallets. Passing this proposal will make delegation easier for my experiment and also allow whales to easily break up and delegate VP to decentralites who deserve it.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nProposed Solution:\nThis proposal suggests the implementation of a multi-address voting power delegation mechanism, which will allow members to delegate their voting power to multiple wallet addresses, rather than being limited to a single address.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBenefits:\nLower gas fees: Delegating to multiple addresses will require fewer transactions, leading to lower gas fees for members.\nIncreased transparency: Allowing members to delegate to multiple addresses will make it more transparent for anyone to see the different delegates another user has.\nImproved voting power distribution: Allowing members to delegate to multiple addresses will enable a more distributed voting power, resulting in a more representative decision-making process.\n\nSpecial thanks to Gino for creating the original poll.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f7d61af0-a2f3-11ed-a669-05ba4b332980)**",

All the items were programmatically generated and stored as ERC721 tokens on Ethereum Blockchain.\n\n**Highlight:**\n\n**1. MetaDoge is the first ever PFP NFT that can let users swap to their 3d avatar in Decentraland even before DCL has linked wearable. (Only in Meta GamiMall for now) Please check the above pictures to see what they look like. The holder can simply press a button to swap to their 3d avatar in Meta GamiMall.**\n\n**2. MetaDoge has extra game utility in Meta GamiMall**\n\n**3. MetaDoge will share part of the revenue of Meta Live Studio**\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nFirst, MetaDoge is already a limited version of Linked Wearable but can be only used in Meta GamiMall. Most of our users are Decentraland players, and they want to have the experience to be able to use MetaDoge as an avatar even if they get out of our scene.\n\nSecond, MetaDoge has a strong game bonding with Decentraland. It has some decent game utility in Meta GamiMall (Coin bonus)\n\nThird, MetaDoge has built out its brand recognition to Decentraland players through our wearable Doge Head.\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n4999\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nBoth my DCL name and discord name are MetaDoge which is well-recognized by a lot of community members. Second, we will use MetaDoge's official Twitter and discord to spread this news to prove it.\n\n\n## Smart Contract Address\n\n- 0x1acF970cf09a6C9dC5c5d7F2ffad9b1F05e4f7a8\n\n\n## Manager Addresses\n\n- 0x9B3ae2dD9EAAD174cF5700420D4861A5a73a2d2A\n- 0x62372d2b29D2A0b1de1b6162bF5b251636C76dEC\n\n\n## Is this collection generated programmatically?\n- Yes\n\n\n## Method\n\nWe created a 3d model in Blender for each attribute that we have (body type, eyewear, ear wears.....) and then used an algorithm to create all of the models.\n\nCheck the below link to see our Blender screenshot of all the attribute models.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/VX028pc.png\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=25b86e00-a19b-11ed-a669-05ba4b332980)**",

    "body": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (LordLike)\n\nThe absence of a period of duration for DAO committee members in Decentraland can lead to several potential issues, including:\n\n1.  Lack of accountability: Without a set term, committee members may not be held accountable for their actions, leading to potential abuses of power.\n\n2.  Lack of fresh perspectives: Without new members regularly joining the committee, the same individuals may hold power for an extended period of time, stifling innovation and new ideas.\n\n3.  Lack of trust: The absence of term limits may lead to concerns about the impartiality of the committee, as members may become entrenched in their positions and less responsive to the needs of the community.\n\n4.  Reduced democratic participation: The absence of term limits may discourage community members from participating in governance, as they may feel that their voices will not be heard.\n\nIt is important to balance the need for stability and consistency with the need for accountability, fresh perspectives, and democratic participation. A system with term limits and regular elections can help to address these potential issues.\n\nThere is a good example DAO can follow - Accountability Committee.\n\nAccording to Article 5 of the Accountability Committee Framework:\n\n\"This Accountability Committee selected by the Decentraland DAO Community is expected to be in office for twelve (12) months and the members could be re-elected only for one consecutive period.\"\n\nhttps://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ce104d00-7d94-11ed-8456-a323c09ee17e\n\nYes: Set duration period for DAO Committee members for 12 months and members re-election only for one consecutive period.\n\nNo: Leave as it is.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7d7c3fb0-a086-11ed-868f-0d503a0e5b7e)**",

    "title": "Process for Establishing Formal Working Groups",
    "body": "> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Process for Establishing Formal Working Groups](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bcf89060-0e5c-11ed-9d53-7b405ea02bcb)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal outlines the purpose and process for establishing formal DAO Working Groups.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nWorking Groups allow engaged members of the DCL community to collaborate and ultimately solve for the problems and opportunities identified in Pre-Proposal Polls. This proposal aims to formalize the process of creating community-led working groups following the passage of a \"pre-proposal poll\" and leading to the submission of a well-thought-out and socialized governance proposal.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n[The DAO Governance Proposal Stages](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5193f850-5c00-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174) outlined three distinct stages for identifying community stakeholder interests, socializing solutions, and developing a well-thought-out and implementable governance outcome. In many cases, however, this is not a seamless process, and the building of community consensus and researching impacts and implementation paths require coordination and collaboration across various distributed points of the Decentraland Community.\n\nGovernance as voting further has potential to create divisive community and political dynamics. First past the poll voting in particular can promote polarization and zero-sum engagements. Working within the constraints of our established governance process, it is thus extremely important to have a robust and participatory \"decision-making process\" such that the votes we table are representative to the greatest extent possible.\n\nWorking groups - \"a group of people who investigate a particular problem and suggest ways of dealing with it (Merriam-Webster, 2022)\" - aim to provide opportunities for community members to engage in productive discourse, and complex decision-making. Working groups also provide a forum for the support and engagement of experienced governance facilitators and other community stakeholders to help direct the group toward identifying and articulating a solution or set of potential solutions for broader community consideration.\n\nFormalizing procedures for establishing and conducting working groups will create a transparent, consistent, and efficient model for moving from the identification of an issue toward the best effort at its resolution. This approach will be one way to tackle and escalate different issues toward concrete outcomes, but it will not become the exclusive one, since each community member will still have the possibility to adopt or choose other ways to channel their needs, discussions or concerns.\n\nThe proposed Decentraland DAO Working Group process is based on an adaptation of the Delphi Method. [The Delphi Method](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/management/the-delphi-method) is a research and decision-making methodology used to gather insights and opinions from a variety of experts and stakeholders, and is particularly well suited for distributed and decentralized contexts. The objective of the Delphi method is to generate consensus, and draw from our “collective wisdom” to inform our decision making process.\n\nDuring active working groups, the DAO Facilitation Squad (or a representative from the working group) will share the status and stages of each active working group as a part of the regular agenda of bi-weekly Town Halls.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nDecentraland DAO Working Groups will be carried out  in the following steps:\n\n1.  **Successful Pre-Proposal Poll** - Proposal passes the initial stage of the governance process, signaling sufficient community support for the allocation of DAO/Community time and resources for active facilitation.\n\n*   (1.1) ***Promote to Draft Proposal*** - A proposal that has passed the Pre-Proposal stage could be promoted to a Draft Proposal, without the creation of a working group. In other words, a working group is in no way a prerequisite for an initiative to move forward through the governance process. However, if an issue is overly complex or the division of opinions is such that proposal drafters believe broader inputs and insights would be necessary, a formal working group may be established.\n\n2.  **Working Group Formation** - There are two ways working groups can be formed. First, is through the promotion of a Pre-Proposal Poll to a Working Group by the author or a contributor to the poll. The second, is by a specific Pre-Proposal Poll aiming to establish a working group around a given issue, which may be put forward to the community by any Community Member, including DAO Operator or Committee Members.\n\n3.  **Distributed Delphi Method** - The Delphi Method is a structured process for obtaining expert/stakeholder opinions on a particular topic, in order to gather input and reach consensus on a particular topic. It typically involves several rounds of questionnaires or surveys, with each round building on the results of the previous round. The Delphi Method is useful for decision-making in a DAO as it allows for collection of diverse perspectives. Decentraland DAO’s Distributed Delphi Method includes the following steps:\n\n*   (3.1) **Facilitator Selection** - Proposal author/contributors self-select or appoint a representative to facilitate the working group. See Annex A for the full role and responsibilities of the Working Group Facilitator. Unless specifically requested to abstain, a member of the DAO Facilitation Team will support the Working Group Facilitator(s), and may be selected by proposal authors to serve as the Working Group’s primary facilitator. If the designated Working Group Facilitator quits at any stage, a DAO Facilitator or a DAO Committee Member will fulfill the role and decide with involved community members if the working group should remain active.\n\n*   (3.2) **Call for Working Group Participants** - A general call for Working Group participants will be issued via Discord, DCL DAO Twitter, and pathways for joining will be established, likely including integration with the Governance dApp from the Pre-Proposal Poll.\n\n*   (3.3) **Pose question or problem to the Working Group** - The Working Group Facilitator will design and distribute the question(s) / problem to the group, for participants to respond to. This can be in the form of a single question, questionnaire, or survey.\n\n*   (3.4) **Solutioning** - Participants submit their proposed solutions/responses in the form of written comments, open-ended questions, or other form as specified in the questionnaire/survey.\n\n*   (3.5) **Analysis and Reporting** - The proposed solutions/responses are analyzed, grouped into categories and/or themes, summarized and shared by the working group Facilitator(s).\n\n(Continued in Conclusion Section Below)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n*   (3.6) **Solutioning (II)** - A second round of clarifying questions is posed by the Working Group Facilitator. Members of the Working Group then have the opportunity to revise and tailor their responses, based on the summary of themes and categories, and adapted questions, repeating the process until a consensus is reached or a set of multiple potential pathways forward is developed - as determined by the Working Group Facilitator. In the interest of time, this process should not be repeated more than four times.\n\n4.  **Working Group Synopsis Report & Round Table Discussion** - The DAO Facilitation Team will lead, or support the drafting of a Working Group Synopsis Report, detailing outcomes of the Working Group. This report will serve as a record of the proceedings, and as a point of reference for future discussions and drafting of proposals around the issue. The report will be publicly shared and discussed in a Round Table format, including Working Group Facilitators and Participants.\n\n5.  **Draft Proposal** -  A proposal that has passed the Pre-Proposal Stage and workshopped via the Working Group, may be published as a Draft Proposal by the original proposals Authors or Contributors. Once again, a working group is not a prerequisite for a Draft Proposal.\n\n*   (5.1) **Proposal Feedback & Review** - Proposal authors may share the Draft Proposal for review and feedback with the wider community in general, and Working Group Participants in particular, to ensure it is representative of Working Group outputs.\n\n6.  **Impact & Implementation Pathways** - The final stage of a the Governance process calls for a detailed assessment of the proposal’s impact and description of implementation pathways. At this stage, it is possible that impacts and implementation pathways have already been determined through the previous Delphi Method, have been devised by authors of the proposal, or require further workshopping to be determined. In case of the latter, a the Delphi process can be reiterated, using prompts focusing on proposal impacts and implementation pathways. Alternatively, the Working Group may continue through asynchronous, synchronous discussions to support more detailed understandings of impacts and implementation pathways.\n\n7.  **Binding Governance Proposal** - The goal of a working group is not necessarily to produce a binding governance proposal. The aim is to facilitate a process that builds consensus, rather than divisive, zero-sum voting. That said, when faced with a complex or divisive issue, a Working Group can assist with development of a well-thought out and implementable Binding Governance Proposal, where the impacts are clearly understood and articulated, and implementation pathways established prior to its passage.\n\n*   (7.1) **Non-Binding & Automated/Augmented** - All Working Group procedures and outputs are non-binding. When possible, the process should be automated and integrated into the existing governance dApp, such that there is a user journey for establishing and carrying out the process. These pathways will be described in detail in the Binding Governance Proposal - if this proposal passes the Draft Proposal stage.\n\n**Conclusion**: Working Groups aim to expand our governance from a process of voting to one of decision-making. The formalization of this process with clear pathways for the collection and synthesis of information will assist us in devising well thought out and implementable governance policies.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e47386c0-9ee1-11ed-868f-0d503a0e5b7e)**",

    "title": "Should Tudamoon be Unbanned from the DAO Discord",
    "body": "> by 0x76fb13f00cdbdd5eac8e2664cf14be791af87cb0 (Matimio)\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIn December 2022, the user \"Tudamoon,\" was banned from the Decentraland DAO Discord.\n\nThe DCL DAO Discord Rules state that in the event of a ban from the server, the user \"may appeal the ban through a governance poll, explaining why they should be allowed back in the server.\"\n\nThis poll is being submitted by Matimio, the moderator who made the banning decision in the Discord. This is an imperfect and interim solution, and this specific case should fall under the DAO’s broader Discord Community Moderation Policy, if and when this policy is modified and adapted by the Decentraland DAO Community.\n\nFor the ban to be upheld indefinitely (until a broader policy is enacted), it should pass successfully through all stages of the governance process - as this is the only established governing pathway we currently have at our disposal. If a simple majority of voting power is in favor of lifting the ban (with or without conditions), the ban will be lifted without progressing further through the governance process.\n\nIn the interim period, the user will be allowed back into the discord, however muted in all channels.\n\n**The Case**\n\nThe following provides a short summary of the case for and against the ban, based on publicly shared information by Matimio and Tudamoon on the DCL DAO Forums. This information was compiled by Matimio, with the aim of being objective, and there have been no changes to any of the text from how it appeared on the forums.\n\n**Reason for the Ban according to Matimio:**\n\n> “Based on those \\[Discord] rules I made a decision to remove you from the discord. Here is my reasoning, and it is based on a series of events, and pattern of behavior in the community:\n>\n> 4.1. You made a racist attack against a community member on the forums.\n>\n> 4.2 I received four harassment complaints from active community members against you, and deemed these complaints to be credible. I received numerous messages from long-standing community members and creators expressing fear of unfounded reprisals for statements and/or votes they made, indicating that they would no longer be a part of the discord or participate in discussions as a result.\n>\n> 4.3 In our final back and forth you told me to “get the fuck out”\n>\n> 4.4 After the ban your pattern of behavior continued and intensified.\n>\n> So the reason for the ban:\n>\n> **Toxicity** - constant and insistent personal attacks and antagonistic engagement that made the discord and other governance forums an unsafe and uncomfortable environment, leading community members to refrain from posting in the server, and in many cases voting on proposals, due to fear of targeted, personal and public attacks.\n>\n> **Personal Attacks** - in the discord and on the forums used misinformation tactics, including the selective use of information and highlighting of old or irrelevant information to make prescient arguments and/or attacks.\n>\n> **Harassment** - continued and unrelenting monitoring and personal posting tagging of community members on forums and in discord and use of race-based attacks on the forums.”\n>\n> *   \\[finally] Yes I did share my personal background because of my role, and did so in a professional way as part of our grant proposal. However, in this “governance proposal,” \\[to remove me from my position] the information about me you include in it and how it is laid out and framed, is a type of doxxing. It is entirely unnecessary and targeting and is in complete violation of the “norm” of pseudonymity that we operate under in our community, and as a result in itself could be viewed as a form of threat or harassment.\n\n**Reasons against the Ban according to Tudamoon:**\n\n*Text in \\[brackets] was added by Matimio to help highlight the key argument of a claim*\n\n> “I am going to start this off with two words: **ZERO EVIDENCE.**\n>\n> **\\[Banned for Personal Gain]** You banned me right before you proposed your grant (a few days later) which you would be making an income of more than $58 an hour. You knew I would have a problem with that and have other questions as I usually do. However, you figured if you banned me, you can just blow off my questions like this is a personal thing I have against you which is untrue. I disagree with your tactics and political manipulation of the DAO to fit your needs.\n>\n> **\\[Banned due to Politically Motivated Vendetta w/ No Evidence]** You know I am very active and ask questions that actually matter to the community. But you knew you could get away with banning me for zero cause. You have yet to show evidence backing your claims and I am authorizing you to do so in front of the community. Please share your evidence. I wish I had the screenshot of you talking crap about my ideology of Libertarianism. I can’t even go back because guess what? My conversations with you were deleted. Same with ZumMond. You are good at deleting evidence and censoring people. Ever since I said I had that libertarian belief, you have consistently found ways to find issues with me. You made this personal.\n>\n> **\\[No Proof of Cyber Harassment]** Prove the cyber harassment on the DAO Discord. Please do. It sounds like you disagree with my opinion and wanted to censor me. Once again, please share the evidence for the permanent ban.\n>\n> The last conversation I had on the Decentraland DAO Discord was between Chris Metatrekkers and myself. His \\[Matimio’s] job is to facilitate DAO conversations, he instead chose to be one sided in a discussion rather than mediating a problem with Chris Metatrekkers. Then he didn’t like my responses, so he banned me. There was no cyber harassment\n>\n> **\\[Incident Not Racist and Not Related to Discord]** I never made any racist attack. I called him a Nigerian Prince Scammer, which unfortunately that’s what Scammers from Nigeria are called in the U.S. when you receive a phone call from a scammer in Nigeria. Chris Metatrekkers is from Nigeria and I called him that because of that reason. Not because of his race. I will admit it was disrespectful and if I could take it back I would not have said it. However this has ZERO to do with the Discord page. It’s almost as if you were holding this as a grudge against me.\n>\n> Personal attacks from me never happened on the Discord Server. The only attack was on the forum. None of which was misinformation. Please provide evidence.\n>\n> You are claiming this happened on the forums, but where has it happened on the discord to result in a ban? The answer: It hasn’t. There is no reason I should have been permanently banned on the Discord.”\n\n- Unban\n- Keep Ban\n- Unban but Mute\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ec2437f0-9eb1-11ed-868f-0d503a0e5b7e)**",

    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should DAO proposals have a pre-defined 'Abstain' voting option?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2f752230-8deb-11ed-aae5-394e6c1c2226)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal is about adding an abstain predefined option to the DAO's voting system. This would allow members to indicate that they do not wish to vote either for or against a proposal.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nAdding an Abstain voting option would allow DAO members the option to abstain from voting on proposals, allowing them to express a neutral position rather than being forced to vote for or against a proposal. Also useful in cases where members have already voted and want to withdraw their vote without having to take a stance.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, there is no way for people who have already voted on a proposal to take their VP out of the defining equation. If they voted YES, they can keep their vote or change it to NO. Especially for critical proposals, during the voting period, a message on Discord or the forum, a tweet, a conversation with another DAO member, a Town Hall, or your thought process could change your stance on a matter. Having an abstain option would allow members to keep being involved in the governance process without having to necessarily take a stance on the final outcome.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAdding an abstain predefined option to the DAO's voting system (Similar to how the Invalid Question/Options currently work for Polls), would allow members to indicate that they do not wish to vote either for or against a proposal. This option would be available alongside the existing options of \"Yes\" and \"No\". This option will be added only for proposals with Yes/No options (Not applicable to Pre-proposal Polls)\n\n### Implementation\n\n*   The abstain option will be added to the DAO's Snapshot space and the Governance dApp and will be available to all members in Yes/No proposals (POIs, Catalyst Node, Name Ban, Grant Request, Linked Wearables Registry, Draft Proposal, and Governance Proposal).\n*   The abstain option will be counted separately from the \"for\" and \"against\" votes, and will not affect the outcome of the vote.\n*   A summary of the abstain votes will be included in the results of the vote, along with the total number of \"for,\" \"against,\" and abstain votes.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### Benefits\n\n*   Allows members to express a neutral position on a proposal, rather than feeling forced to take a stance.\n*   Provides a more accurate representation of member opinions, as it allows those who are unsure or neutral to make their views known.\n*   Increases the legitimacy of the voting process and its engagement levels, as it allows all members to fully participate without feeling pressure to take a position they may not fully agree with.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2d146330-9e70-11ed-868f-0d503a0e5b7e)**",

Right now, the Decentraland Foundation is the main contributor to the Reference Client’s open source code base, but given the DAO’s ownership of the client (and the need to have the DAO approve major changes), the Foundation is hindered in how quickly and effectively it can develop new features and improvements.\n\nTo overcome this hurdle, the Foundation is suggesting that the DAO delegate the development and maintenance of the Reference Client to the Foundation. This delegation would be reviewed and renewed every 12 months.\n\nThis delegation would empower the Foundation to:\n\n*   Communicate and execute a solid roadmap both for community developers and users\n*   Build a richer feature set (e.g. better in-world navigation, social interaction, and content moderation tools)\n*   Ensure that the client is faster and more stable\n*   Improve the quality and performance of the client’s graphics\n*   Improve the client’s ability to support more concurrent users\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nTo better understand the scope of this proposed delegation and the extent of it’s impact on the broader platform, it’s important to define some terms:\n\n### The “DAO”\n\nThe DAO was created to help the community direct the development of Decentraland’s policies, infrastructure, content moderation, and smart contracts. The DAO owns the smart contracts for Decentraland’s digital assets (like LAND, Names, Wearables, etc.), so any changes made to those contracts must be approved by the DAO. Furthermore, platform-impacting decisions or changes to Decentraland’s codebase (i.e. decisions that impact the entire Decentraland community, like strategic decisions for the client) must be approved by the DAO.\n\n### The “Decentraland Foundation”\n\nThe Foundation is a non-profit organization that was formed to help protect the intellectual property of the Decentraland brand (something that the DAO lacks the legal status to do). The Foundation was also tasked with supporting the decentralization of the platform alongside the community.\n\n### The “Decentraland Stack”\n\nDecentraland is made up of a complex “stack” of different smart contracts, protocols, and applications. Together, they make up the Decentraland Platform. Generally speaking, the different decentralized layers can defined as:\n\n1.  The **smart contracts** that make Decentraland’s scarce digital assets (like LAND, Estates, Wearables, Names, etc) possible.\n2.  The **Catalyst software** used to run the distributed network of servers that host and provide content to users.\n3.  The **software development** kit that people use to build content for Decentraland’s virtual world.\n4.  **dApps like the Builder** that allow people to create and arrange content for Decentraland’s virtual world without writing code.\n5.  **dApps like the Marketplace** that allow people to manage and exchange Decentraland’s digital assets.\n6.  **Clients** that allow users to interact with the content of Decentraland. Decentraland clients are like web browsers (e.g. Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox) in that they all provide access to the same network and information, but are not the web itself. In 2022, this also includes the PC and Mac clients, currently in beta and available to download from https://decentraland.org/download.\n\n### The “Reference Client”\n\nThe Decentraland Reference Client discussed in this proposal is the web based app and the PC and Mac clients that allow people to access and interact with content and other users within Decentraland’s virtual world. This application sits at the top of the Decentraland Stack.\n\nIt’s helpful to remember that the Reference Client does not constitute the entire Decentraland Platform, that it is just one alternative for accessing the Decentraland Platform, that anyone can develop a customized client, and that the roadmap discussed in this proposal for the Reference Client can’t dictate changes to any other components of the platform—those must still be approved by the DAO on a case by case basis.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n#### Duration and renewal of the delegation\n\nThe DAO would delegate to the Foundation the responsibility of developing and maintaining the Reference Client for a period of 12 months, according to a roadmap approved by the DAO on a biannual schedule. The Foundation will be responsible for presenting and delivering a product roadmap for 2023.\n\nThe roadmap will be prioritized in collaboration with the DAO by implementing a mechanism for proposing and signaling support on new initiative.\n\n#### Ideation and validation for the roadmap\n\nThe DAO will have a clear path to contribute ideas and requests to the roadmap. This could take the form of a new polling category within the DAO, specific to client feature requests and suggestions. These proposals could then be voted on by the community, with accepted suggestions being passed to the Foundation for inclusion in the next iteration of the product roadmap.\n\n#### Deviations from the roadmap\n\nThe Foundation would be able to reasonably depart from the roadmap to make full use of the Foundation’s familiarity with the competitive market, Decentraland’s user base, and regulatory requirements\n\n#### Funding development\n\nFunds to develop the Reference Client (e.g. payroll for developers) would still be provided by the Foundation, not the DAO.\n\n#### Termination of the delegation\n\nThe DAO may choose at any time to revoke this delegation in favor of giving it to another entity.\n\n#### Limits of the delegation\n\nThe delegation is limited to the Reference Client and does not allow the Foundation to make changes to other areas of the Decentraland platform; any such changes must pass through a vote in the DAO.\n\n### Rationale\n\n*   The Reference Client is a complex application that is relevant to the continued development of the platform.\n*   The development life cycle for something as complex as the client requires countless technical and strategic decisions to be made on a daily basis\n*   Given the time it takes to write proposals and pass them through the DAO, it would be extremely impractical to have the DAO weigh in on each of these decisions\n*   So, it’s clear that in order to develop the client at a speed sufficient to compete with other metaverse projects, at least some level of formal delegation is needed\n*   The Foundation is the best candidate to receive this delegation given its proximity to the platform, its resources, and its knowledge of the market and the Decentraland community\n*   The suggested delegation would provide the Foundation with the autonomy needed to execute quickly, while still being subject to the relevant decisions, directions, and control of the DAO\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### Transparency and reporting\n\nThe Foundation is working on finding new ways of working that would improve the transparency of its roadmap plans, scope, ongoing work, and updates on results.\n\nIn order to enable two-way communication and create more opportunities for questions and answers, the Foundation has already announced that it will hold regular (approximately monthly) technical AMA sessions with the community. They are also considering additionally holding more general AMA sessions in order to cover all the areas in which the community may have questions and concerns. These sessions could potentially take place on a quarterly basis.\n\nLastly, the Foundation is looking into establishing more public data sources to easily provide data to the public that has previously only been for internal use.\n\n### The Decentraland Foundation’s mission statement:\n\nDecentraland’s goal is to be a fun and entertaining platform with a thriving community that educates and onboards people to the philosophies and tech of Web3 while empowering Creators in the hope that, when the masses realize why decentralization is important, a viable option will be available and the next iteration of the internet won’t be monopolized by a handful of corporations.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b8933dc0-9ce3-11ed-ae61-5f6dd0bf8358)**",

After creating the jewel, we check the content, and if approved by our policies, the jewel is displayed in our store (shop.joia.digital). To support the Metaverse Designers' community, each artist will receive 15% of the value in item's gold, in the Polygon wallet indicated during the creation of the digital gem. This process is automatic, as the royalty information for the first sale is implicit in the collection's smart contract itself. You'll only pay for what's described in the ad, we do all post-artist transactions with the payment we receive in the sales process, through specific smart contract.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe want to have our NFTs represented in Decentraland because it provides a unique and immersive experience for our customers. Decentraland allows us to showcase our digital jewelry in a 3D environment, giving our customers a more realistic and engaging experience. Additionally, Decentraland provides a secure and decentralized platform for our customers to purchase our products, ensuring that their transactions are safe and secure. Finally, Decentraland allows us to reach a larger audience, as it is a popular virtual world with millions of users.\nWe are using POLYGON (not Ethereum).\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n5\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nhttps://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/13414098/officers\n\nWe are using POLYGON (not Ethereum).

    "title": "Redirect NAME minting fees to the DAO",
    "body": "> by 0x87956abc4078a0cc3b89b419928b857b8af826ed (Nacho)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Redirect NAME minting fees to the DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5c469630-9350-11ed-ae61-5f6dd0bf8358)\n\n## Summary\n\nStop burning MANA when a new NAME is claimed and redirect the proceeds to the DAO.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nDecentraland NAMEs are a key piece of the Decentraland identity system, they represent an avatar’s name and also function as links to your LAND in Genesis City or to your [personal world](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-decentraland-worlds-beta-your-own-3d-space-in-the-metaverse/).\n\nDecentraland NAMEs are implemented as subdomains of dcl.eth, thanks to ENS protocol. Any wallet can spend 100 MANA to mint a unique NAME. At the moment, the MANA collected in registration fees is being burned. So far, 36,785 Decentraland Names have been claimed equating to 3,678,500 MANA burned ~ ($1,410,000 USD at current market price).\n\nThis proposal aims to redirect those fees to the DAO in order to continue funding the long-term operations of the DAO.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe MANA burning mechanism was originally designed to add value to other holders, giving support to the MANA price and making it more scarce every time a NAME is minted.\n\nHowever, [this article](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/9/17/stop-burning-tokens-buyback-and-make-instead) claims that redirecting such fees to the DAO and reinvesting them into improving the platform is more beneficial in the long term. The marketplace fees when through the same decision in the past, moving from burning to redirecting them to the DAO. This proposal would be another step in the same direction and remove the last burning mechanism of the DAO.\n\nFor the long-term stability of the DAO is good to generate income streams. They are essential to do budgeting and they enable the DAO to redirect the stream as they see fit. For example, funding grants or creating a pool of VP to fund a delegate system.\n\nThis change brings an important question regarding the 100 VP assigned to every minted NAME. Nowadays when a name is minted the user burns 100 MANA in exchange for the NAME, so the total VP stays constant. If these fees are redirected to the DAO it will generate subtle inflation of VP, because the original MANA will still exist (while controlled by the DAO).\n\nThis proposal argues that an inflationary policy of VP is not particularly bad for the project. In particular, this is a safe case because the newly minted VP is tight to an on-chain action that can not be faked and it requires the user to spend MANA to do it.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe ENS implementation has  [two contracts](https://github.com/decentraland/avatars-contract/tree/master/contracts/ens) , the Controller and the Registrar. In order to make this change, a new version of the Controller needs to be developed, audited, and deployed.\n\nThis new version of the controller should  [stop burning](https://github.com/decentraland/avatars-contract/blob/bd49fb20c71aa086351e544ffe0aaed6cce1c5ff/contracts/ens/DCLController.sol#L67)  and redirect the MANA to the DAO address. The new implementation of the controller should have a function to change the beneficiary address.\n\nTo make this change effective the Security Advisory Board needs to call the Registrar contract to make use of the new implementation of the Controller.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nStop burning MANA on behalf of transferring it to the DAO. There is not associated risk of keeping MANA circulated.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nA new DCLController smart contract will be created by the Foundation's dApps team. The team will also look for audits quote and manage the process. Then, the DAO will refund the Foundation for the cost of the audits.\n\nOnce the new DCLController is ready, the SAB will remove the current controller from the DCLRegistrar and add the new DCLController.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe recent release of Worlds has brought an increased value add to NAMEs, the Decentraland native identity system. An increase in NAME registrations might be expected over the next few years and it’s important for the DAO to have the capacity to decide what to do with such proceeds.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a3bdc100-9b34-11ed-ae61-5f6dd0bf8358)**",

    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct)\n\n### Introduction\n\nAs Decentraland and the immersive social media trend continue to grow, the importance of content creators cannot be overstated. These individuals are responsible for creating the wearables and in-game items that bring our metaverse to life, let people express themselves via their looks and empower the vision of an open and decentralized creator’s economy. However, their contributions are currently not recognized in the governance of the project\n\n### Proposal:\n\nTo acknowledge the vital role of content creators in the Decentraland ecosystem, **we propose that voting power (VP) be assigned to those who submit and get their collections (Wearables & Emotes) approved** by the Wearables Curation Committee. The VP would be awarded as follows:\n\n*   Content creators must pay a submission fee to have their creations published in the marketplace. At the moment the fee is set at USD 150 paid in MANA.\n*   Once the collection is approved, the cost in MANA will be awarded to the wallet that submitted the collection.\n*   The amount of VP awarded will be determined by the price of the MANA at the moment of the submission (or approval, based on technical feasibility) following the existing 1 MANA = 1 VP rate.\n*   If the collections get rejected by the Wearables Curation Committee that VP will be subtracted from the total VP count.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn addition to amplifying the voice of content creators in the governance of the project, this proposal is expected to have the following benefits:\n\n*   Encourage more people to create and submit high-quality content, leading to a more diverse and vibrant metaverse.\n*   Create an incentive for content creators to continue contributing to the project.\n*   Create a way for content creators to be rewarded for their work.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=17f5b550-98d8-11ed-ae61-5f6dd0bf8358)**",

    "title": "Should VP Delegation have time limits?",
    "body": "> by 0xd4f1cab694c4424c4796549edbb9b489789f4df5 (TudaMoon)\n\nI understand that this had a pre-poll prior to this, however I think my personal name may have caused some bias on the discussion. I am asking for thoughtful consideration on this.\n\n**As for the actual length of time, I would like to discuss this in the forum, so please comment below on what you think the length of time should be.** If this passes the pre-poll, I will put the most desired amount of time in the next draft proposal.\n\nThere are a bunch of reasons this should be implemented. In fact, I am having trouble finding reasons on why it shouldn’t. The only reason I can see why it shouldn’t be implemented is because it requires work to be done by the delegator and possible gas fees.\n\nAn example of where this exists comparatively is on OpenSea. Opensea doesn't allow you to put an indefinite amount of time on offers for your NFTs or indefinite amount of time for your sales of your NFTs. However if you put your NFT up for sale for 1 month and it doesn't sell by then, you would simply sign another contract to put it up for sale again.\nThis is similar to how VP delegation could be set up.\n\nThis would **NOT** put limits on the amount of times someone could be delegated, this would put limits on the actual amount of time delegation would exist per signed transaction.\n\nLet’s use this hypothetical situation for example. I choose to delegate Wallet A 1000 VP. From the date I sign my contract to that delegate, if this term limit idea was implemented, the VP would be delegated for 1 year. After 1 year or whatever term the DAO decides, it would then return the VP back to the Delegator’s wallet. So as the delegator I would have to sign a transaction a new transaction to delegate it again. I always can keep choosing to delegate to Wallet A, but maybe after 1 year I realize that they are voting on proposals which are not in line with my personal beliefs. Maybe I would then choose to find someone who is more aligned with me. This would give me, the Delegator, responsibility in keeping up with their delegation, instead of turning my head and hoping everything works out.\n\n**Reasons Term limits for delegation of VP will be a positive improvement to the DAO:**\n\n1.  **Reflection.** It gives the delegator a chance to reflect on who they delegated their VP to this past term. It would give them the decision to continue their delegation with the same delegate or find a new delegate. This would require minimum interaction by the delegator.\n2.  **Inaccessible Wallets.** Wallets that are owned by dead people or with lost private keys, will not indefinitely delegate their VP to someone else without the ability to un-delegate it.\n3.  **Uncomfortable Undelegating.** Delegators may get uncomfortable undelegating their VP to someone. These terms may give some people a good reason to move around their VP.\n    Maybe a Delegator just likes to choose someone new each term. It’s nothing against the delegate themselves, just they like to move around. This idea will be helpful and cause less friction and has the possibility to give more voices a chance to have some VP.\n4.  **Inactive Delegates.** Look at how much land parcels there are without anything on them or nothing being built. Land Owners with VP may not pay attention to DCL, but may delegate someone to make decisions on their behalf. Without being involved in DCL, they may delegate their VP to someone and not ever come back to see how things are going. This gives them a reason to come back and see the progress made.\n\nAlso after a small discussion with Gino, I do believe we can come up with more complex governance measures, however this is more of a quick solution to implement, while we find a way to upgrade this in a more complex way. With these reasons, I believe time limits on VP delegation should be considered.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a76304f0-9747-11ed-ae61-5f6dd0bf8358)**",

Bears love yachts, good vibes --- and Honey. All the girls love Fancy Bears!\n\nWe invented the Trait Swap, the first Dynamic NFTs platform, where you can personalize your PFPs with traits from different high end brands. We work with a number of PFP collections we want to bring to Decentraland.\n\nWe have 50+ partners coming from the crypto space, fashion, lifestyle and NFT sectors, including Binance, Crypto.com, eToro, Vlaunch, GamerHash, Diesel, and many others.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe want to be the first Dynamic NFT avatar collection in Decentraland. We want to make our solution available for other NFT collections in future too.\n\nOur goal for Fancy Bears Metaverse is to create a dynamic infrastructure that will integrate all the existing avatars, games, metaverses, AI, sports, and VR/AR entertainment experiences.\n\nDecentraland is one of the most important steps that we need to take to fulfill our vision. In the end, our goal is to bring hundreds of millions of users to the metaverse. But we can’t do it all alone. It will be possible only with a clear plan, great tech, and a long list of partners, like Decentraland, seeking new frontiers outside the world they already know.\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n200\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nThe official website is linked with the names and social media of our team here:\n\nhttps://www.fancybearsmetaverse.com/about-new\n\n\n## Smart Contract Addresses\n\n- 0x87084ec881d5a15c918057f326790db177d218f2\n- 0xce15f018b083844a0b650b8000a00f227fb8cfbe\n\n\n## Manager Address\n\n- 0xB357E7575a780980E4ceE86654A6aCd0cC13b77f\n\n\n## Is this collection generated programmatically?\n- No\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e8de87c0-957a-11ed-ae61-5f6dd0bf8358)**",

    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should we stop burning MANA when a NAME is minted?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1a067940-6f1d-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598)\n\n## Summary\n\nStop burning MANA when a new NAME is claimed and redirect the proceeds to the DAO.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nDecentraland NAMEs are a key piece of the Decentraland identity system, they represent an avatar’s name and also function as links to your LAND in Genesis City or to your [personal world](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-decentraland-worlds-beta-your-own-3d-space-in-the-metaverse/).\n\nDecentraland NAMEs are implemented as subdomains of dcl.eth, thanks to ENS protocol. Any wallet can spend 100 MANA to mint a unique NAME. At the moment, the MANA collected in registration fees is being burned. So far, 36,785 Decentraland Names have been claimed equating to 3,678,500 MANA burned ~ ($1,410,000 USD at current market price).\n\nThis proposal aims to redirect those fees to the DAO in order to continue funding the long-term operations of the DAO.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe MANA burning mechanism was originally designed to add value to other holders, giving support to the MANA price and making it more scarce every time a NAME is minted.\n\nHowever, [this article](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/9/17/stop-burning-tokens-buyback-and-make-instead) claims that redirecting such fees to the DAO and reinvesting them into improving the platform is more beneficial in the long term. The marketplace fees when through the same decision in the past, moving from burning to redirecting them to the DAO. This proposal would be another step in the same direction and remove the last burning mechanism of the DAO.\n\nFor the long-term stability of the DAO is good to generate income streams. They are essential to do budgeting and they enable the DAO to redirect the stream as they see fit. For example, funding grants or creating a pool of VP to fund a delegate system.\n\nThis change brings an important question regarding the 100 VP assigned to every minted NAME. Nowadays when a name is minted the user burns 100 MANA in exchange for the NAME, so the total VP stays constant. If these fees are redirected to the DAO it will generate subtle inflation of VP, because the original MANA will still exist (while controlled by the DAO).\n\nThis proposal argues that an inflationary policy of VP is not particularly bad for the project. In particular, this is a safe case because the newly minted VP is tight to an on-chain action that can not be faked and it requires the user to spend MANA to do it.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe ENS implementation has  [two contracts](https://github.com/decentraland/avatars-contract/tree/master/contracts/ens) , the Controller and the Registrar. In order to make this change, a new version of the Controller needs to be developed, audited, and deployed.\n\nThis new version of the controller should  [stop burning](https://github.com/decentraland/avatars-contract/blob/bd49fb20c71aa086351e544ffe0aaed6cce1c5ff/contracts/ens/DCLController.sol#L67)  and redirect the MANA to the DAO address. The new implementation of the controller should have a function to change the beneficiary address.\n\nTo make this change effective the Security Advisory Board needs to call the Registrar contract to make use of the new implementation of the Controller.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe recent release of Worlds has brought an increased value add to NAMEs, the Decentraland native identity system. An increase in NAME registrations might be expected over the next few years and it’s important for the DAO to have the capacity to decide what to do with such proceeds.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5c469630-9350-11ed-ae61-5f6dd0bf8358)**",

    "body": "> by 0xaa20991f26aefa3d91592e84e3ead5cd12f6413c (Lexapro)\n\nThis proposal is made under the [Formal Process for Adding/Removing DAO Committee Members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1) Section 3. Therefore it cannot be seen as an invalid question.\n\n### Summary:\n\n*Mathew Markman*, who goes by **Matimio** in Decentraland, and is the team manager of the [DAO Facilitation Squad](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=89a33730-765b-11ed-bc92-ef497b387215), has been acting outside of the scope of their authority and promoting his own biased political agenda that is detrimental to the health and well-being of the entire Decentraland community.\n\nMathew Markman is not some innocent underdog here. Mathew Markman holds a **PhD in political science,** among other degrees, and has long been active in politics. It is important for you to keep in mind that this individual is influenced by their political beliefs and motivations. As you evaluate their credibility, please consider their biases, and assess the evidence presented in a reasonable way.\n\nSee Matimio's [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathewmark/)\n\n![Credentials](https://i.postimg.cc/85r1n9XZ/Mathew-Markman-education.png)\n\nHere you can see what his interests are and it seems that he is quite familiar with Fascism and Far Right Extremism\n![Extremism](https://i.postimg.cc/SsK92SsJ/Mathew-Markman.png)\n\n### Proposal:\n\nVotes in favor of this pre-poll will result in removal of this committee member and will leave this Team Manager position open which is has a salary somewhere between [$58.33 & $87.50 an hour](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=89a33730-765b-11ed-bc92-ef497b387215). Certainly, I am sure we can find someone who is “more fit” for this position at that salary.\n\n### Justification:\n\nMatimio has acted outside of their authority by:\n\n### *Creating working groups without DAO Approval*\n\n**FACTS:**\n\n1.  Matimio proposes and establishes a [Formal Process for DAO Governance](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5193f850-5c00-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174) which includes governance proposals in 3 stages.\n\n2.  Matimio created a [pre-proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bcf89060-0e5c-11ed-9d53-7b405ea02bcb) to create a [process to form working groups](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=bcf89060-0e5c-11ed-9d53-7b405ea02bcb). It passed, and never promoted it to draft or a governance proposal.\n\n3.  Matimio created working groups in Decentraland DAO discord which act like a working group, have discussions like a working group and are under the Discord Category titled “Working Groups.”\n    The DAO Facilitator Squad’s claim defending this is they are only called working groups, but they are only “discord channels.” If something quacks like a duck, acts like a duck, but is called a cow, is it a duck? These ARE acting as working groups which is a violation of the authority granted to him under the DAO.\n\nThese issues have been brought to them by *ZumMond* in the Decentraland DAO general chat, but since have been deleted. Seems like censorship and controlling their political agenda. As Matimio stated “culture produces political outcomes.” If you control the culture, you control the political outcomes.\n\n### *Unable to act in an unbiased manner in his DAO Facilitator role*\n\nMatimio associates himself with the ideology of *pluralism.* He also has an aggressive stance against any culture whom is among his far left ideologies.\n\n![Pluralism](https://i.postimg.cc/dQSw2qWG/Pluralism1.png)\n\nYes “Wikipedia” articles will mention famous names like Socrates and Aristotles as being part of the pluralist ideology, but that is far from true. The Pluralist ideology has claimed ownership of leaders whom these Pluralists cannot prove actually had those ideals or acted in purely in favor of that ideology. Pluralism is purely an agenda that acts against *individual thought*. In fact **Pluralists despise the individual,** but will go in full strength promoting their agenda to further their own selfish opinions and needs. You will see this with Matimio.\n\nMatimio has consistently promoted a political agenda that is biased and divisive to the community, which is not in line with the community's values and principles.\n\nThe actions and behavior of DAO Facilitator Squad have had a negative impact on the community and have hindered the ability of the DAO Faciliatator Squad to achieve its goals of promoting open discussions and beliefs. Facilitating ideas that can be discussed in a friendly way.\n\n**FACTS:**\n\n1.  Matimio has prematurely cut people off in Town Hall meetings during the open discussion at the end. I recall him claiming there was 10 minutes left and a conversation was happening that he opposed to so he cut the meeting short with 5 minutes left. This was his way of controlling community culture which fits his political agenda.\n2.  Matimio banned *Tudamoon* permanently for claiming that he was disrespectful, but when asked to produce the evidence, failed to show it. Meanwhile, I have witnessed arguments between him and Tudamoon and Matimio has claimed to highly oppose Libertarianism, which from what I understand seems to be an open belief system promoting the *individual*.\\\n    There have been other Discord members who align with his views who have actually been “disrespectful,” but he has chosen to look past those individuals' actions because they align with the culture he is trying to promote. Is a closed controlled culture any better than a dictatorship? Does web3 have a defined culture or a correct way to act?\n3.  Matimio is not facilitating DAO discussions. He is only promoting his ideology and will not allow other ideologies to have a voice in his culture.\\\n    In fact, Gold Guy was timed-out earlier today in the Decentraland DAO for asking questions. The DAO Facilitator team moderates this discord. There seems to be a problem with asking questions that spark thought. It’s almost as if he and his team are trying to discourage opinions and create a culture that they like, not what the users of Decentraland want. We are aiming for decentralization for a reason. Therefore all opinions and questions that are not scams, should be allowed.\\\n    Ad Hominem attacks are different, but if it is not a direct attack on one’s person, it should be permissible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIt is important for the community to maintain a healthy and harmonious environment for all members, and this proposal is intended to ensure that the actions of one individual do not harm the community as a whole. Let's remove Matimio from his position of Team leader and give someone the role of Team Manager of the DAO Facilitator Squad that will promote integrity, accountability, free speech and facilitate conversations in a meaningful way that will improve Decentraland Governance as a whole.\n\n- Remove Matimio\n- Keep Matimio\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=dc038240-91e1-11ed-aae5-394e6c1c2226)**",

    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct)\n\nThis proposal aims to improve the accuracy of the voting count by restricting the ability of members with less than a certain amount of Voting Power (VP) to vote on proposals. VP is a measure of a member's level of commitment and engagement with the Decentraland and the DAO and for now, it is calculated based on the number of tokens (MANA, LAND, ESTATES, or NAMES) or the amount of Delegated VP that wallet has.\n\nBy restricting voting to members with more than a certain amount of VP, the proposal would ensure that only committed and engaged members have a say in the decision-making process. This would help to reduce the influence of bots and other entities that may have a minimal interest or stake in the DAO and only vote to farm a potential airdrop. Additionally, it would encourage members to take an active role in the organization and align their interests with the organization's interest.\n\nThis proposal suggests that the voting mechanism would be modified to check for a member's Voting Power, and if it is less than a certain amount, it would not allow the member to vote on a proposal.\n\nNote: The amount of VP will be proposed on the Draft proposal, but I would love to see the community discuss in the comments section how much that amount should be.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0952c630-910f-11ed-aae5-394e6c1c2226)**",

    "title": "Should the DAO implement a mechanism to delegate VP to multiple wallets?",
    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct)\n\n### Background:\n\nCurrently, **voting power delegation in our DAO is limited to delegating to a single wallet address**. That means that if a wallet has 1000VP, it can only delegate the totality of that VP to another address. At the moment, the walkaround to delegate VP to multiple users is first to transfer your tokens to multiple wallets and then delegate VP from each one of those wallets. This increases the cost of delegation due to the need for multiple transactions (At least one for transferring tokens and another one to delegate).\n\n### Proposed Solution:\n\n**This proposal suggests the implementation of a multi-address voting power delegation mechanism**, which will allow members to delegate their voting power to multiple wallet addresses, rather than being limited to a single address.\n\n### Benefits:\n\n*   Lower gas fees: Delegating to multiple addresses will require fewer transactions, leading to lower gas fees for members.\n*   Increased transparency: Allowing members to delegate to multiple addresses will make it more transparent for anyone to see the different delegates another user has.\n*   Improved voting power distribution: Allowing members to delegate to multiple addresses will enable a more distributed voting power, resulting in a more representative decision-making process.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9d698ea0-9108-11ed-aae5-394e6c1c2226)**",

    "title": "Bidding and Tendering Flow",
    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Bidding and Tendering Flow](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a44efb60-7d62-11ed-8456-a323c09ee17e)\n\n## Summary\n\nA process for the DAO to agree and allocate resources to strategic projects, make a public call for bids, and later decide on the best provider for the job.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis is not a replacement for the Grant Program, but instead a process to incubate and generate competing grant requests for a previously defined project.\n\nThe Tendering process should be implemented as a new proposal flow, similar to the governance process. It starts with a basic community signaling about the project, and later formalizes the requirements in a Tender Proposal. Once approved, bids for the project will be received over a period of time and the winner is decided by a community vote.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAn important goal is to enable any member of the community to propose a project without the requirement of being the main executor of it.\n\nThe process starts with building consensus around the end goal of the project by using a customer-centric approach. The initial *Pitch Proposal* should address questions about the target customer, and the problem it solves, and any doubts about how it should work. Here, the audience of the proposal is the customer that will use the product.\n\nThe second step is to escalate the project idea into a *Tender Proposal*, including any project requirements, stakeholders, and details about the public tender. The co-authors of the proposal should include representatives of the stakeholder groups signaling their support. Here, the audience of the proposal is a company or freelancer that might submit a bid to build the project.\n\nThe process aims to generate more business opportunities for studios and freelancers looking to work for the DAO. Many talented teams are eager to work but lack the context of what needs to be done.\n\nFinally, this process allows the DAO to allocate its budget in a transparent and efficient manner, by allowing the community to compare offers and vote for the most suitable one.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proposal Flow\n\nA new flow of proposal categories should be added to the Governance dApp.\n\n**1. Pitch Proposal**\n\n*   Any member of the community can send a pitch proposal to test community sentiment.\n*   The proposal should include a product’s name, intended customer, the problem the product solves, benefits to the customer, a call to action telling the customer how to take advantage of the product right away, a FAQ answering the business or tactical questions about building the product.\n*   Duration 10 days and 2M VP threshold.\n*   Minimum required VP to submit a pitch proposal: 100 VP.\n\n**2. Tender Proposal**\n\n*   Passed Pitch Proposals can be promoted to Tender Proposals by any community member.\n*   The proposal should include a summary, specification, deliverables, deadlines, required skills, stakeholders, and any bidding submission details.\n*   Duration 14 days and 4M VP threshold.\n*   Minimum required VP to submit a tender proposal: 2,500 VP.\n\n**3. Bid Proposal**\n\n*   A passed Tender Proposal opens the bidding process for third parties.\n*   The bid should include budget, project duration, starting date, deliverables, roadmap, personnel, beneficiary address, and email address.\n*   Bid details will be kept confidential by the governance app until the submission period is over.\n*   The bidding period should last *at least* 2 weeks.\n\n**4. Selection Proposal**\n\n*   All bids received will be revealed at the same time and put up for a community vote for 2 weeks. Each bid will need to collect at least the VP threshold of the requested budget to be considered passed.\n*   The passed bid with VP simple majority will be considered the winner. The voting process should implement Snapshot’s  [ranked or weighted voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types#ranked-choice-voting-instant-runoff-voting).\n\n### Guidelines\n\nThe following articles should be included in Decentraland’s documentation for future reference.\n\n1.  Placing a bid implies acceptance of an offer in its entirety, including all of its requirements. If the bid is selected, upon initial payment or initial work of the bid, all elements are considered met to consider this a binding contract.\n\n2.  Studios or freelancers may formulate proposals individually or in the form of a partnership as long as they fulfill all requirements and must be included as co-authors and personnel.\n\n3.  The economic proposal must be presented in USD dollars. It will be paid in stablecoins using the vesting contract subject to the conditions of the Grants Program.\n\n4.  Bid proposals that do not cover the full project will be rejected.\n\n5.  Deliveries should be in the form and within the deadlines expressed in the Tender Document, otherwise bids will be rejected.\n\n6.  The community may ask the bidders on the grant proposals to provide complementary information about the company or the proposed solution.\n\n7.  The winning bid will be converted into an enacted grant, following the same policies that govern the Grant’s Program.\n\n8.  In the event that there’s only one valid bid available, a second call should be made. At least two options should be available to decide.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe Bidding and Tendering Flow has the potential to bring about significant changes within the Decentraland community, depending on a range of factors.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, the proposal is implemented smoothly, allowing the Decentraland DAO to identify and allocate resources to strategic projects in a transparent and efficient manner. This could lead to increased satisfaction and trust within the community, as well as potentially attract new talent and businesses to work with the organization.\n\nHowever, it is possible that there may be some initial challenges with the implementation of the proposal, which could be addressed through updates and additional guidelines or training.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the proposal is not implemented successfully, leading to a lack of progress on important projects, decreased satisfaction within the community, and potentially a loss of trust in the DAO's decision-making processes.\n\nIt is worth noting that this proposal will co-exist with the Grants Program, and a new governance proposal aligning both systems may be developed in the future.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe Governance Squad should implement the following changes:\n\n*   Update Decentraland documentation with detailed requirements.\n*   Create a submission form for Pitches, Tenders, and Bids.\n*   Create a voting view for Pitch, Tender, and Selection proposals.\n*   Support a new voting system (ranked voting) to pick among bids.\n\nThese changes are all feasible and can be developed in parts, starting with the Pitch proposal, followed by the Tender and Bidding Part, and finally with the Selection proposal.\n\nThe Grant Support Squad should be responsible for measuring performance metrics for each project and overviewing its roadmap progress. A project should be revoked if such performance metrics are poor or fails to meet any of the requirements.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Bidding and Tendering process is a method to select the most suitable service provider or supplier, by comparing proposals against specific criteria. This system encourages fairness and transparency of opportunities, as well as the effectiveness of funds allocation.\n\nThe proposed Bidding and Tendering approach aim to separate the process of deciding *what needs to be done*, from the decision of *who should make it happen*.\nThe Pitch and FAQ it’s a good method to align the community on the final goal of the project, it can be the guide during the development process and the final success evaluation.\n\nIn order to have an effective bidding process it’s important to get many competitive offers from different suppliers. This will require an active effort from the community and DAO core units to make sure the Tender Proposal reaches as many studios as possible.\n\nThe Grant Program and the Tender and Bidding system will coexist, the first being the foundational layer for the second one. Eventually, the community will form some sort of criteria regarding which projects should go directly to the Grant Program and which ones deserve to go through the Tender and Bidding process.\n\nThe proposed scheme aims to be the minimum viable framework to test this idea. Future improvements might involve incentivizing stakeholders to craft tender proposals and oversight the progress of the project. Also delegating to a committee the decision of which bid is the winner might be more effective than a community vote. But for this stage, it’s better to start simple and iterate later using real-world experience.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=108f6b70-8fc4-11ed-aae5-394e6c1c2226)**",

    "title": "Should we address the Voting Power Distribution in the DAO?",
    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\n### Introduction\n\nA Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a type of organization run through smart contracts on a blockchain. It is governed by the rules encoded in its smart contracts and by the decisions made by its stakeholders, who are typically its members or token holders. A DAO can be used for decision-making, resource allocation, and governance of a project or community.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe Decentraland DAO was created as the governance platform for the decentralized metaverse in order to ensure its longevity and adaptability. The metaverse is a public good and its governance should be treated as such.\n\nDecentralized governance is an ongoing and adaptable process that is not perfect, but serves as a guiding principle. It is hoped that the successes and failures of the DAO will generate knowledge for future iterations and inspire other online communities.\n\n### Historical context\n\nIn 2018, the Decentraland DAO was originally run by an off-chain voting app called  [Agora](https://agora.decentraland.org/) , developed by the Decentraland Foundation. It weighed votes based on the number of contributions made by initial stakeholders, using a token voting scheme. At that time, the DAO decided  [to assign voting power (VP) to LAND holders](https://agora.decentraland.org/polls/0387cebc-31a3-4e12-a7b4-e9926dd5b392) .\n\nIn September 2020, the DAO moved to an  [on-chain smart contract using Aragon’s tools](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/the-decentraland-dao-explained/) . The DAO took the form of an Agent that claimed ownership of all critical contracts and a treasury of MANA. The DAO Agent can be commanded through on-chain community voting or through a Security Advisory Board entrusted to protect the DAO  [in the event of a security risk](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/decentraland-security-update/) .\n\n*The new Aragon scheme was more transparent and decentralized than the previous one, but it had low usage due to the fact that stakeholders had to pay Ethereum fees to cast a vote.*\n\nIn May 2021, the DAO launched  [the current governance platform](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/dao-announcement/)  using Snapshot’s off-chain voting and empowered a DAO Committee that acts as a “trusted proxy”, enacting the results of off-chain voting on-chain.\n\nSince then, the DAO has voted on several topics related to VP, including  [enabling VP delegation](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d43c1e50-daa9-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b) ,  [assigning VP to owners of wearables L1](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=16aa0de0-f405-11ec-b5fc-5178246a05ac) , and  [keep VP assigned to the landowner in rental contracts](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c98bd010-74b1-11ed-a9bf-f772a12a0556) .\n\n### The Problem\n\nThere is an ongoing conversation about the VP distribution and how a few wallets can have a significant impact on a vote. The current voting scheme has led to several issues:\n\n*   Newcomers believe their vote does not make a difference.\n*   The legitimacy of a vote flipped by one address is questionable.\n*   Big holders prefer to abstain from voting to avoid backlash.\n\nThis issue can be summarized as a lack of balance in the distribution of voting power, leading to a feeling of disenfranchisement among newcomers and a potential for abuse by large holders.\n\nThe following strategies offer potential solutions to address this problem and create a more fair and democratic governance process:\n\n**Strategy 1: Give VP to active contributors**\\\nThis strategy aims to compensate valuable contributions to Decentraland with VP in order to create positive reinforcement for valuable actors. Some activities that could be compensated include:\n\n*   Active players\n*   Event organizers\n*   Game creators\n*   Wearable creators\n*   Active voters\n*   Code contributors\n\n**Strategy 2: Community Delegates Program**\\\nActive participants with good reputations should be eligible to represent the DAO and receive a significant amount of VP delegated to them.\n\nTo maintain their role, they should vote and comment diligently on governance proposals. This strategy aims to bring a variety of viewpoints to the decision-making process and create a more informed community. A strong community should be able to prevent selfish actions by large holders.\n\nA  [call for delegates](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-for-delegates-apply-now/5840)  was made a year ago, and this proposal should build upon that.\n\n**Strategy 3: Limit the amount of VP a single wallet can hold**\\\nThis strategy aims to balance the distribution of VP by limiting the amount of VP that a single wallet can hold. For example, one vote should not weigh more than 20% of the threshold (minimum participation). This would reduce the potential for abuse by large holders and give small holders a greater impact on the voting process. It would also ensure that a single vote cannot significantly sway the outcome of a vote, promoting a more democratic governance process.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe persistent issues surrounding the VP distribution in the Decentraland DAO highlight the need for a more balanced distribution of voting power. The three proposed strategies – giving VP to active contributors, establishing a community delegates program, and limiting the amount of VP a single wallet can hold – offer potential solutions to address this problem and create a more fair and democratic governance process.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8192a5f0-8fa9-11ed-aae5-394e6c1c2226)**",

    "title": "New Wearable Rarity Tier: Exotic (50 mint/supply)",
    "body": "> by 0x56469159d91eb810dce34dd13ec4ed8194bca7be (NikkiFuego)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[New Wearable Rarity Tier: Exotic (50 mint/supply)](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f85772a0-8799-11ed-b125-310d98b69cd1)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis poll is to try and introduce a new Wearable rarity tier (50 mint/supply) that allows for greater flexibility and exclusivity within the market.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nHaving to decide between 100 mint and 10 mint is often a really difficult decision. Not only for Wearable Creators but also for projects onboarding with Wearables. This last year I have made over 200 wearables and the majority of those were with 3rd party entities looking to onboard onto the platform. It's always been a pain point trying to weigh the benefits of 100 vs 10. While 10 is very expensive because you have less wiggle room to give away for any promotional needs while 100 isn't quite exclusive enough for some projects and visions.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe addition of a new Exotic Rarity Tier (50 Mint) to the publishing options would be important and would help to solve a number of problems that currently exist within the platform.\n\nOne key benefit of adding a new Exotic Rarity Tier is that it would provide content creators with more flexibility and control over their creations. Currently, creators must choose between two Rarity Tiers: Common (100,000 Mint), Uncommon (10,000 Mint), Rare (5,000 Mint), Epic (1,000 Mint), Legendary (100 Mint), Mythic (10 Mint), and Unique (1 Mint). These options can be limiting for creators who want to produce a limited number of high-quality items that are not quite as rare as a 10 Mint item, but rarer than a 100 Mint item. By adding a 50 Mint Rarity Tier, creators would have a new option that falls between these two extremes, allowing them to more accurately reflect the value and rarity of their creations.\n\nAnother benefit of adding a new Rarity Tier is that it could help to address some of the issues related to scarcity and demand on the Decentraland platform. Currently, the Mythic (10 Mint) tier is highly coveted, and as a result, items at this tier are often sold at a premium price. This can create a situation where only the most financially well-off users are able to afford Rare items, which can lead to feelings of exclusivity and inequality within the community. By adding a 50 Mint Rarity Tier, there would be more options available to users who are looking for unique and valuable items but may not be able to afford the high prices of Rare items. This could help to create a more inclusive and equitable market for wearable items.\n\nFinally, the addition of a new Rarity Tier to the publishing options would be a valuable addition to the platform, providing content creators with more flexibility and control over their creations and helping to address issues related to scarcity and demand. It would also create more opportunities for users to find unique and valuable items that fit their budget and interests. When the user base grows again this will also provide another rare category for mass audiences.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe are proposing the addition to the option to submit Exotic (50 Mint) to the publishing pipeline. This tier would be put in between Legendary and Mythic tiers. As well as a new tab in the marketplace as shown in the example here: ![Img](https://i.imgur.com/148tLDt.png)\n\nThere also should be an update on the Wearables Editor User Guide page under the Rarity table.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we believe this addition of Exotic tier will provide new opportunities for creators to create interesting projects and provide an even more creative way to innovate new wearables. We believe this tier will also interest some other micro & macro communities that have yet to jump into Decentraland. **If there is anything that Doki and I can do to assist in the integration of this new tier we are willing to help!**\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f059d990-8ed2-11ed-aae5-394e6c1c2226)**",

    "title": "New Wearable Category: Hands",
    "body": "> by 0x56469159d91eb810dce34dd13ec4ed8194bca7be (NikkiFuego)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[New Wearable Category: Hands (Resubmission)](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=04191430-8796-11ed-b125-310d98b69cd1)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis draft aims to introduce a new and highly desired Wearable Category: Hands! This has been a category that the community has been talking about for nearly a year now. It passed the Poll stage with 192 Yes votes and 1.6M VP.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nCurrently, we see the wearable accessory categories flooded with hand accessories. This dilutes the accessory categories greatly and overall doesn't feel like good quality of the use of those categories. This draft's goal is to solve that problem by introducing a proper category for hand accessories/items.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe addition of a Hands wearable submission category to the platform would be important for a number of reasons. First, it would allow content creators to submit and showcase their creations. Currently, creators must fit their hand-related wearables into existing categories, which may not always accurately reflect the true nature of their work. By adding a new category, creators would have a more specific and relevant place to showcase their creations, which could lead to increased visibility and potential sales.\n\nSecond, a Hands wearable submission category would also allow the Decentraland platform to accommodate a wider range of wearables and potentially attract a larger user base. This could be particularly beneficial for creators who are working on innovative or niche wearables that do not fit neatly into existing categories. By giving these creators a dedicated space to showcase their work, Decentraland could become a more diverse and dynamic platform.\n\nThe addition of a new wearable submission category would be an important step for the Decentraland platform, as it would allow for greater creativity and innovation from content creators and a more immersive and dynamic experience for users. This also allows for a revenue generation opportunity. The amount of wearables that can be made for a Hands category is endless.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**We would propose the following parameters/guidelines for curation on the new category:**\n\n*   1500 tri limit (Identical to Feet Category)\n*   2 materials 2 textures limit. All textures must be square. (Identical to Feet Category)\n*   All pre-existing Upper-Body wearables should automatically hide the Hands category.\n*   Creators should be able to update their existing Upper-Body wearables as needed to accommodate this change.\n*   Skins should automatically hide Hand Category. (Identical to Feet Category)\n*   A mass email should be sent to every wearable creator (they have to submit an email upon publishing) to let them know about the change so that creators who have pre-existing wearables that include hand accessories (IE: Tiara, Top-Head, Earring, etc) can update their wearable as needed.\n\n**We would propose the following changes to the Wearable Docs:**\n\n*   The Decentraland Avatar System: Body Shape, Head, Upper Body, **Hands**, Lower Body, Feet.\n*   Let’s see those hands! All gloves, rings, handbags, weapons, etc. are applied to the hands, not the upper body. ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/NU51Go6.png)\n*   Swapping out a new Upper Body image: ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/IMxBcuE.png)\n*   Update in Wearable Categories section under Skin: Skin: Replaces the entire avatar (head, upper body, **hands**, lower body and feet except accessories). As well as adding Hands to the list of Categories below Upper_Body.\n*   New image for Upper Body, Lower Body, and Feet section: ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/fUZeK8B.png)\n*   New addition to the Skin Weighting list: Right Hand and Left Hand Bones: for the hand and upper body’s intersecting vertices.\n\nAs well as adding a new Backpack Icon in the wearable section: ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/JCzsIF8.png)\n\n**Provided Resources**\n\n*   Doki and I have curated a Blender resource file that comes preloaded with examples of new avatars with the Hands separated and caps filled. Ideally replacing the currently pre-existing open source file for avatars.\n*   Doki and I would also like to volunteer our 3D Modeling services **for free** to the foundation to help curate default hand wearables for the community to introduce the new category.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the addition of a new Hands wearable submission category to the Decentraland platform would benefit the community, the platform, and wearable creators in various ways. For the community, it would provide a more immersive and dynamic experience as they would have access to a wider range of wearables to choose from. For the Decentraland platform, it could lead to increased revenue through publishing fees and higher levels of user engagement. And for wearable creators, it would provide a more specific and relevant place to showcase their Hand creations, which could lead to increased visibility and potential sales. All in all, the addition of a new Hands wearable submission category would be a positive development for all parties involved and would help to create a more vibrant and dynamic virtual world.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=33d8c100-8ec8-11ed-aae5-394e6c1c2226)**",

    "body": "> by 0x511a22cdd2c4ee8357bb02df2578037ffe8a4d8d (ginoct)\n\n### Purpose\n\nTo give DAO members the option to abstain from voting on proposals, allowing them to express a neutral position rather than being forced to vote for or against a proposal. Also useful in cases where members have already voted and want to withdraw their vote without having to take a stance.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nAdding an **abstain** predefined option to the DAO's voting system (Similar to how the **Invalid Question/Options** currently work for Polls), would allow members to indicate that they do not wish to vote either for or against a proposal. This option would be available alongside the existing options of \"Yes\" and \"No\". This option will be added only for proposals with Yes/No options (Not applicable to Pre-proposal Polls)\n\n### Benefits\n\n*   Allows members to express a neutral position on a proposal, rather than feeling forced to take a stance.\n*   Provides a more accurate representation of member opinions, as it allows those who are unsure or neutral to make their views known.\n*   Increases the legitimacy of the voting process and its engagement levels, as it allows all members to fully participate without feeling pressure to take a position they may not fully agree with.\n\n### Implementation\n\n*   The abstain option will be added to the DAO's Snapshot space and the Governance dApp and will be available to all members in Yes/No proposals (POIs, Catalyst Node, Name Ban, Grant Request, Linked Wearables Registry, Draft Proposal, and Governance Proposal).\n*   The abstain option will be counted separately from the \"for\" and \"against\" votes, and will not affect the outcome of the vote.\n*   A summary of the abstain votes will be included in the results of the vote, along with the total number of \"for,\" \"against,\" and abstain votes.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2f752230-8deb-11ed-aae5-394e6c1c2226)**",

    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\nThe Linked Wearables Registry is a list of approved partners that can submit wearables as representations of external non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in Decentraland.\n\nFor example, suppose a company called Nowkie sells shoes in real life (IRL). Last year, Nowkie created a collection of NFTs of unique shoe designs (2D images) and distributed them to their customers and online communities. Now, Nowkie wants to allow the holders of their NFTs to be able to wear the shoes in Decentraland. Therefore, they apply to the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to be listed in the Linked Wearables Registry.\n\nThis initiative was designed as an experiment in metaverse interoperability, where the same NFT has multiple values. It can represent a 2D image on some platforms and can be worn in Decentraland. It's a way to onboard new communities and increase Decentraland awareness.\n\nTo become a Linked Wearables publisher, the following steps are required:\n\n1.  Apply to the DAO (two weeks of voting, 4 million voting power required)\n2.  Create the wearables you want to offer to your NFT holders\n3.  Submit the wearables for review\n4.  Create an API that maps the ownership of wearables and NFTs for your collection\n\nThe submission of wearables for review is free for Linked Wearables partners. This was designed to allow a brand to submit a programmatic collection of 10,000 wearables. However, the DAO should pay wearable curators to review such submissions (up to 50 items). For more details about the economics, please check [the governance proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5534b120-b786-11ec-903a-6546e8793cef).\n\nThere are several concerns with the Linked Wearables Category:\n\n*   It does not generate economic revenue for the DAO and implies curation costs.\n*   The process seems too long and cumbersome for a brand to apply.\n\nDo you think this initiative needs to be restructured? If so, please vote yes and share your thoughts and ideas in the comments below.\n\nI will follow up with some draft proposals that might address the current situation.\n\n- Yes\n- No\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fba5d070-8dd2-11ed-aae5-394e6c1c2226)**",

After FTX fiasco new people won't participate in the project that is full of anons.\n*   a lot of LAND is owned by anons, but if there was a link to chat people would be able to make mini neighborhoods together\n\nTo sum it up - it's all about collaborating and a healthy ecosystem. What are your thoughts?

This means that full collusion of the Committee (or their absence over 24 hours) is required to empty the wallet. In other words, one honest participant is enough to prevent collusion.\n\nIf the SAB fails to act in time, and the other two DAO Committee members are away, anyone with access to the third member's private key (maybe a cyber threat actor) can swipe the ~17M USD from the DAO. The SAB should not be bothered with watching the Committee's actions: the SAB members should only concern itself with providing emergency solutions to technical bugs and problems with smart contracts.\n\nGiven these facts, under the current scenario, **adding a member strictly increases the security of the DAO funds**.\n\nThe only caveat to adding more members is that any one member can block all the other members from the Committee from enacting transactions, but that is less critical -- the DAO can decide to remove this member so operations can continue.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nIf this proposal passes,\n\n*   A new round of postulations shall be held using the [already established process for adding a DAO Committee Member](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5fd09520-ae73-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231)\n*   The four finalists from the current stage can be invited and postulated without a new interview\n*   The selected two new candidates shall be added following the current procedure to add a committee member\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLooking forwards to the future, our DAO should:\n\n*   improve the agility and ergonomics of the governance processes\n*   reduce burden on DAO Committee members\n*   not involve the SAB in day-to-day activities\n*   reduce the trust required in particular individuals\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e946d100-8b6a-11ed-bd37-2b7f3eae6b63)**",

    "title": "Creating Monetization Functions for Scenes Allowing Content Creators to Generate Income using DCL as a Business-enabled Platform",
    "body": "> by 0x3f6b1d01b6823ab235fc343069b62b6472774cd1 (MetaRyuk)\n\nI am currently drafting an official proposal to seek grant from the DAO to support this intention and long term benefit for both DCL and content creators. This pre-proposal is to get the response from DCL members whether such an intention would be supported should the official proposal be proposed.\n\nTL;DR: To create scenes with monetization aspects for content creators to achieve income and in parallel, contributing back to the DAO with the potential demand for $MANA, LAND, Wearables and NAME.\n\nOne of the most common questions asked by users is how do people make money in the metaverse. This is a common question given how reports from established financial institutions and market researchers predicted that the metaverse could potentially bring about trillions of dollars within the metaverse economy by 2030. Currently, the people making profits in DCL are the early land buyers who either profited by 'flipping' or getting rental payment. Grants passed by the DAO to proposals mostly did not equipped with the intent to be self-sufficient and this has caused people to accuse proposers as 'DAO Drainers' especially when the output from DAO is more than the input (money coming back into Decentraland after grants have been given).\n\nI have been brainstorming on the possible ways where users and content creators to generate income by using Decentraland as the platform. This involved scenes coded with monetization aspect allowing users to monetize their content with their unique offerings/services. An example of a basic scene involved NFT (self created or wearable) gated function to virtual buildings, galleries or rooms. Additionally, this NFT gated function can also be used to control or restrict an avatar's privilege - imagine a virtual building with multiple levels/storeys accessible via an elevator or a vehicle and depending on the NFT/wearable owned, the avatar can access specific levels/storeys thereby accessing specialized content. Another way is password-protected objects such as image and video or even doors. Content creators can allow their members to access their unique content via password provided by the creators. Content creators can also enable MANA payment function seamlessly within DCL where members/avatars can access their specialized content once payment is made to the creators wallet - imagine a video that only plays after a MANA payment is made. Content creators can leverage the NAME NFTs to generate WORLD scene where their members can be redirected to 'private' WORLDs where a more personalized content can be offered or interaction with the creator/artist.\n\nHow this benefits Decentraland:\nThe NFT gated function enables demand for wearables and also allow content creators to generate their own Ethereum-based NFTs as membership pass and 'authentication' factor.\nThe MANA payment function enables the demand for $MANA token.\nThe 'private' WORLD scene enables the demand for NAME NFTs.\n\nIn short, what i intend to achieve here is the ability for content creators to monetize content using DCL as a platform to conduct its business and in parallel enables demand for $MANA and contributing back to the DAO.\n\nA sample scene can be accessed here https://play.decentraland.org/?NETWORK=mainnet\\&position=-81%2C59. Only avatars who owns a DCL ESTATE is able to access the door to the helicopter. The helicopter will then fly to the top of the building and the interior can be accessed via an elevator. The doors in the 3rd level can be accessed with the password '1234'. Inside the room is a gallery of image and video.\n\nImagine a creator hosting unique contents in these rooms and these rooms can be accessed only via a password shared to their members (thereby generating their own specific community). And the building can only be accessed via a vehicle that only accepts avatars with wearables or NFTs generated or airdropped by the content creators.\n\nThis is a summary of my proposal which allows content creators to benefit financially in the long run, thereby, being self sufficient without the continuous effort to receive grants from the DAO.\n\n- Yes. I support this idea that benefits both DCL and content creators.\n- No. I dont support this idea. \n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b7e74d20-88e9-11ed-bd37-2b7f3eae6b63)**",

In addition to this there will be lectures, discussions, NFT-exhibitions, art-installations and more, so anyone with interest in architecture and design could enjoy the event.\n\nMANIFESTO\n\nWe believe that as graphic designers have created the internet we’ve been using for the last decades, the Metaverse would be created by architects and designers.\n\nThe tittle of Biennale \"Presence of the future\" refers to the name of the first Venice Architecture Biennale - one of the greatest events to celebrate architecture and design. \"Presence of the past'' was actually the name of the 1980 Biennale directed by Paolo Portoghesi who has managed to organize an event of global significance bringing together great architects from around the world.\n\nNowadays, more than forty years later our perception of the world and design approach have changed dramatically, digital design tools became the main instruments and created a totally new language and, some might say, in our society and culture Postmodernism has been replaced by Metamodernism (whatever that means after the word Meta has become a brand).\n\nAll in all, \"Presence of the future\" aims to recall the power of architecture to reinvent the modernity and formulate the new quality of life in the immersive virtual space. In the moment when we are witnessing the creation of a new game-changer in the way we communicate, entertain and collaborate we challenge the architects and designers to envision our future in the built form and take the responsibility for it. We believe that this exhibition would bring the life-changing power of architecture and design to the metaverse and would set up a new positive vector for its development.\n\nOPEN CALL FOR PARTICIPANTS\n\n1st stage: open call for submissions\nCandidats will send 3 visualisations of 3d-modeled architectural object reflecting the theme of the Biennale “Presence of the Future” and 200-500 words description of the concept. The jury would rate all projects by several criteria such as concept, formal / spatial complexity, atmosphere (use of light, textures, landscape). The function of the space is not limited: event hall, showroom, maze etc.\n\n2st stage: finalists projects realisation\nAll finalists are guaranteed to receive a grant from the organizers to produce the final spaces for the event.\nAll submitted projects are checked by the technical team and placed on site of the event prior to its opening.\nOn the final day of the event the jury announces the best project of the Biennale, its creators are invited to become the jury of the next event.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nALREADY CONFIRMED STUDIOS\n\nAtrium is global internationally recognized architectural studio with more than 25 years of experience working on projects of different scale and typology from urban design projects to boutique interior spaces, recently they've launched their own product design studio and metaverse spaces production. https://www.atrium.ru/\n\nSA lab is an up-and-coming company, focused on architecture in the digital age.

A fusion of a high end Fashion District combined with elements of an ever evolving city that together will allow for shopping of both virtual and real world physical goods. Our goal is to build the next level in Decentraland attractions. This project will implement a variety of unseen tech for shopping as well as in the realm of user experience that has been in development throughout 2022.\n\nOur Full Proposal can be found in a google doc here: http://surl.li/efpza\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x07918324279e18B755C72281c9f357c076ea8EA2\n\n## Email address\n\nCato@pangeadao.org\n\n## Description\n\nOur Team believes that it is crucial to foster a vibrant ecosystem of businesses, services, and communities to occupy and utilize the land within Decentraland in order to achieve the vision of the Metaverse we all share. While we were seeing an influx of brands entering the space in 2021, many Web2 and even Web3 companies have been hesitant to allocate part of their budget to Metaverse strategy and execution in 2022.\nThrough a partnership with Boson Protocol and WeMeta, we will create a large-scale case study to demonstrate the utility and potential ROI of a Metaverse strategy that we will share with prospective entrants and the entire DCL community.\nWhile there are many benefits that will come from this grant, the three largest benefits that will be derived are;\n\n1.  Gaining key insights and analytics that will help provide clarity for future brands and services that are looking to enter the space.This case study data will be made available to all Decentraland users.\n2.  Providing the brands and services we have partnered with an opportunity to try out the Metaverse free of charge so we can mutually learn from this experience, and share with others.\n3.  Creating a next level and ever evolving Metaverse experience for all those coming to Decentraland as both new and veteran users.\n\nTo summarize we wish to create a truly impressive space where brands can come together and sell their products and services within DCL in an immersive e-commerce experience that keeps the entire purchasing experience in-world and enables the trust-minimized and automated exchange of on-chain (virtual) and off-chain (physical) assets. As Boson’s Launch Partners, the DCL community would be amongst the first to utilize this technology, and benefit from a buying experience that enables the purchase of physical items as NFTs in a decentralized manner.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Build\n\nThis location will be situated on a 5x5 estate owned by PangeaDAO in the heart of the Fashion District. YearTwoThousand design studios aim to create a single structure city shopping plaza that will be host to a multi-level, multi-purpose experience. Each retail location within this space will be created in conjunction with the designers or business that will be part of the space. This will allow for custom experiences catered to each of those involved while still maintaining an overall aesthetic throughout. This multi-tiered structure will feature a clean futuristic luxury aesthetic on its upper levels that will be attractive to business and guests alike, whilst the lower levels will transition into a more future cyberpunk feel to cater to a variety of interests and business types.\n\nAt launch, we will feature a dozen locations for real world business partners as well as a dozen locations for Decentraland creators. In addition to dedicated spaces for our business partners and DCL creators, we will also build several shared spaces and features including: A main art gallery that will be host to a variety of artwork both from the community and abroad.\n\nTwo separate club venues that will be used to host regular events featuring a variety of entertainment and will be at the disposal of each of our partners to use for launch events, as well as any events they would like to host. We will provide a management team on site to help with creating all events and locations within the plaza. Various lounges throughout the plaza will be customized for certain communities that will have both NFT gated entry as well as open entry for all. Featuring multiple levels with various NPCs that will be able to give guest information about tech functions and locations within the plaza. Interactive coding for things such as an interactive in-world closet to see what your friends or others are wearing and link directly to the marketplace, A private messaging system to chat in-world with various levels of privacy. Transportation systems to easily maneuver throughout the plaza and much more tech still in development. Various gardens and points of interest throughout including in the heart of the plaza as well as lush rooftop locations. One of the fundamental points of this build will be to regularly update new activities, installations, business locations and entertainment to ensure that this will be a location that guests will want to return to regularly as well as a place that our partners feel confident in showing friends and clients alike.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nPangeaDAO is a Metaverse real estate trust that acquires, develops, and commercializes land in virtual worlds. Pangea’s investment, development, and consulting arms work to create a more equitable and accessible Metaverse for individuals, collectives, and brands. Pangea has specifically focused on developing a more vibrant ecosystem within Decentraland.\n\nYearTwoThousand (Y2K) is a metaverse design studio specializing in designing, building and operating all things needed for a fully rounded metaverse experience. From virtual wearables that can be implemented in various metaverses to full scale builds that suit a range of needs and uses. Pushing the boundaries of what is possible in terms of coding and building our goal is to be on the forefront of creating the next stage of the metaverse.\n\nBoson Protocol is a Web3 infrastructure using NFTs encoded with game theory. By tokenizing physical items and their data, and allowing them to be sold seamlessly online, Boson enables new commercial experiences for brands and consumers in Web3. It allows consumers to purchase virtual or in-game goods as NFTs, which can then be redeemed for their real-world equivalents, connecting reality and the metaverse.\n\nWeMeta is the data layer for the Metaverse. Through our analytics engine, API, and in-game plugins - we help Metaverses understand what is driving value in their games, how their players are engaging, and surface tools to drive those insights to builders, brands, and communities.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nRoadmap\nQ4 2022:\nReach agreements with participating brands and partners\nBegin 3D modeling\n\nQ1 2023:\nComplete architecture and design\nCode and deploy builds\nOnboard participating brands and DCL creators\nOpen to the public\n\nQ2 2023:\nPublish case study based on traffic analytics obtained through WeMeta, commerce data through Boson Protocol, and survey from all participating partners\nRecruit additional participating brands and DCL creators\n\nQ3 2023:\nContinue to build out the structure in tandem with onboarding new brands and creators\n\nThe full Budget breakdown can be found in our linked document:\n\nArchitect+Builder: 100 monthly hours at $32 per hour ($3200 per month)\n\nProject Management: 100 monthly hours at $25 per hour ($2500 per month)\n\nCoding and weekly updates & maintenance to scene: 80 monthly hours at $40 per hour ($3200 per month)\n\nMarketing/Social and Community Management: 50 monthly hours at $30 per hour ($1500 per month)\n\nCase Study: 150 hours at $40 per hour ($6000 total)\n\nThank you for taking the time to check out the summarized proposal and please check out the full proposal linked above with additional information and details.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=402420d0-87c5-11ed-bd37-2b7f3eae6b63)**",

    "body": "> by 0x56469159d91eb810dce34dd13ec4ed8194bca7be (Vroomway)\n\nThis poll is to try and introduce a new Wearable rarity tier that allows for greater flexibility and exclusivity within the market. Having to decide between 100 mint and 10 mint is often a really difficult decision. Not only for Wearable Creators but also for projects onboarding with Wearables. This last year I have made over 200 wearables and the majority of those were with 3rd party entities looking to onboard onto the platform. It's always been a pain point trying to weigh the benefits of 100 vs 10.\n\nRealistically, we should have a few more new options aside from 50, but I didn't want to overload the initial proposal. I believe this tier will benefit the community both in the bear market we currently reside in and also in a bull market. This allows for better sell-out chances as well for smaller micro-communities that don't want to bottleneck into 10 units.\n\nHere is a visual: ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OAOrMAm.png)\n\nI am open to feedback on the color for the tier. I chose red as its one of the colors we don't have yet and to me, red is obviously my favorite color, but it is also a quality color that is striking to have on an exclusive item.

    "title": "New Wearable Category: Hands (Resubmission)",
    "body": "> by 0x56469159d91eb810dce34dd13ec4ed8194bca7be (Vroomway)\n\nWe are resubmitting a poll to add the Wearable category \"Hands\" to the Wearables Publishing options. There was a poll done in 2021 that passed but did not receive a draft proposal as they were not aware of the governance process. I have spoken to Franky and they have allowed Doki and me to take ownership of trying to pass this governance again. You can find the original poll that passed here: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=be69f510-c7c2-11eb-9861-ebb8fcfd58d2\n\nThis poll aims to assure that the Hand Category is still the desired category from the community.\n\nWe would propose the following parameters/guidelines for curation on the new category:\n\n*   1500 tri limit (Identical to Feet Category)\n*   2 materials 2 textures limit. All textures must be square. (Identical to Feet Category)\n*   All pre-existing Upper-Body wearables should automatically hide the Hands category.\n*   Creators should be able to update their existing Upper-Body wearables as needed to accommodate this change.\n*   Skins should automatically hide Hand Category. (Identical to Feet Category)\n*   A mass email should be sent to every wearable creator (they have to submit an email upon publishing) to let them know about the change so that creators who have pre-existing wearables that include hand accessories (IE: Tiara, Top-Head, Earring, etc) can update their wearable as needed.\n\nFor me, the Hands category has been one that I've wanted since day 1. If we are thinking long-term for the platform, it doesn't make sense to keep allowing the dilution of other categories for the sake of Hand accessories. It is also extremely misleading when something is categorized as a Tiara or Earring when in reality a lot of these items don't have but a dot for earrings and oftentimes nothing to really represent a Tiara to make room for the allotted tris on the Hand accessory. I myself am guilty of this.\n\nI also believe that this will create some inspiration among Wearable creators. New categories tend to breed innovation and creativity. As we saw with the skin category :wink:. This also allows for RPG games to have proper accessories for their game. Salvaging the integrity of the Wearable system is better done sooner than later. We appreciate any and all feedback! :pray:\n\nHere is a visual: ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/fUZeK8B.png)\n\n- Yes, Add Hands Category!\n- No, Do Not Add Hands Category.\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=04191430-8796-11ed-b125-310d98b69cd1)**",

    "title": "Development of Exodus: Goodbye World",
    "body": "> by 0x5117571b0bec00372ce00870ad8e523c704a78b7 (ExodusGBW)\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe goal of this grant proposal is to fund the development of \"Exodus: Goodbye World\" (Exodus), a free to play Metaverse role-playing game (MRPG) based in Decentraland (DCL).    Exodus allows players to immerse themselves in a blockchain integrated, medieval world where they can choose to train skills, collect items, fight monsters, complete quests, participate in community events, interact with other players, and even trade items.\n\nExodusGBW has a consistent and engaged player base as well as a track record of providing new and fun content to its players.  With the help of this grant, we aim to create a truly innovative and engaging gaming experience that will attract a wide audience of players in Decentraland.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x5117571b0BEc00372CE00870ad8E523C704a78b7\n\n## Email address\n\njtv@exodusgbw.io\n\n## Description\n\nExodus is located at coordinate (126,44), and is available for anyone to play for free. Players can choose to train a variety of skills, create tools, forge armors, and combat creatures. The game will feature a range of different environments, including a city, forest, farm, dungeons and more, each area coming with its own unique challenges and opportunities.\n\nLogs, ore, and food, as well as crafted items like swords and armors, will be tradable in a player driven economy.  Players will also be able to interact with one another in other meaningful ways like questing, game-wide events, and seasonal activities. This will create a sense of community and social connection within the game and encourage players to form long-lasting friendships and alliances.\n\nExodusGBW has proven itself to have a growing and active player base, consistently appearing as one of the most trafficked scenes in DCL.  Exodus's seasonal events, like its 2022 Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas events, provide consistent content as well as an opportunity for players to gather with each other while gaming during the holidays.  This, in addition to consistent updates to gameplay and the Exodus scene make the game engaging as well as playable for hundreds of hours!\n\nBeing an MRPG, Exodus places a focus on allowing players to own items they earn in-game.  As such, NFTs and blockchain technology are often integrated into gameplay.  As an example, Exodus has minted thousands of Decentraland wearable Santa hats as rewards for its currently ongoing Christmas event!  ExodusGBW will continue to take providing players the opportunity to own NFTs earned through gameplay as one of the most important aspects of being an MRPG.\n\nWhile providing consistent content for players, Exodus also provides opportunities for interns.  Its senior engineers and designers are happy to mentor and train students to be part of the team.  ExodusGBW is proud that its most recent interns have become productive members of its engineering team who are also capable of producing playable content.  Exodus intends to continue providing such opportunities to expand the educational outreach of the metaverse and DCL.\n\nTo conclude, ExodusGBW is a MRPG with a proven track record of shipping engaging content, promoting community involvement, and providing educational outreach and opportunity in DCL.  ExodusGBW focuses on allowing players to own NFTs through fun and re-playable content.  This grant is focused on supporting the continued development of Exodus in DCL.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration in reading this proposal.

    "title": "Should we extend the DAO Committee to more than 3 members?",
    "body": "> by 0xffac7fd045303112fdb28e9dace8e1334ad324c0 (eordano)\n\n### Summary:\n\n**Adding a member to the Committee strictly increases the security of the DAO. Particularly, since we have 5 good candidates for the role, add 3 new members to the DAO Committee.**\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe DAO Committee is a group of 3 semi-trusted individuals who have been selected by the community to hold keys in a multi-signature wallet and other mechanisms to enact decisions on the DAO. This group is responsible for enacting any passed votes with a binding action, like funding a Grant, banning a name, adding or removing a POI, implementing a Governance proposal or adding a Catalyst node. Currently, since Eric resigned, the group is conformed by only 2 individuals.\n\nParticularly, with the current required-consensus setup, the collusion of these two members is enough to drain the DAO's treasury in case the Security Advisory Board (SAB) fails to react in less than 24 hours (according to [this blogpost](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/decentraland-security-update/), there was a 4 hour lead time last time it was needed).\n\nToday, any member of the Committee can cancel a transaction initiated by another member on the On-Chain Aragon DAO. That means, that full collusion of the whole group is required to empty the wallet, if everyone is aware of the votes being submitted, in a security scheme also named \"anytrust\", meaning that \"one honest participant is enough to prevent collusion\". In other words, adding a member strictly increases security. I trust Yemel and HPrivakos a lot, but this trust is unnecessary. If the SAB fails to act in time, and one of them is on a Vipassana retreat, anyone with access to the private key of the other member (maybe a cyber threat actor) can swipe the ~17M USD from the DAO.\n\nThe only caveat I see to adding more members is that any one member can block all the other members from the Committee from enacting transactions, but that is less critical -- the DAO can decide to remove this member so operations can continue.\n\nAdditionally, the SAB is in charge of enacting these changes on the Committee, which I think is an error. I see the SAB as one half \"special forces\", and one half \"wise judges\" -- in any case, they should not be bothered with any day-to-day activities. In my lousy analogy of SAB as \"judges/military\", having them adding or removing a Committee member is the equivalent of putting some special forces military team in charge of organizing a normal democratic election, and putting judges in charge of execution of presidential transition ceremonies. It is my opinion that the SAB should **only concern itself with providing emergency solutions to bugs and problems with smart contracts**.\n\nWe currently have 5 candidates for the position of DAO Committee Member: [AwedJob](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b36f7c10-8153-11ed-8fa2-17dd3f32db26), [Tobik](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=0a4910f0-8154-11ed-8fa2-17dd3f32db26), [Martriay](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=31bf25c0-8154-11ed-8fa2-17dd3f32db26), [Szjanko](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e64e1920-8153-11ed-8fa2-17dd3f32db26) and [Champ](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=200f1a10-8154-11ed-8fa2-17dd3f32db26). I think we could pick 3 from this list, not only 1.\n\nLooking forwards to the future, our DAO should:\n\n*   improve the agility and ergonomics of the governance processes\n*   reduce burden on DAO Committee members\n*   not involve the SAB in day-to-day activities\n*   reduce the trust required in particular individuals\n\n- Yes: add 3 new DAO Committee members\n- No: add only 1 new DAO Committee Member\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9dbbe6e0-86a0-11ed-b125-310d98b69cd1)**",

We are Oasis Arcade team and we are making this community poll as a pre-proposal for our future grant request to listen to what Decentraland DAO and community have to say about our ideas.\n\nWe are a team of artists, developers and game designers aiming to bring unique and engaging play-and-earn experience to Decentraland. We have been a part of Decentraland community since the middle of June 2022, making games and wearables and bringing them to the community for free. Our development and planning started way back in early March, studying the SDK and Decentraland's community in hopes to bring the best thing we could to the table.\n\nOur dream was and still is to bring a complex play-and-earn ecosystem to Decentraland, bringing more adoption to the platform and increasing its DAU count and general popularity. We are firm believers in this project and have been funding Oasis Arcade out of our own pocket for more than 6 months, giving away more than 1200 wearables and more than 300 MANA in prizes. According to our statistics collection, we have had more than 8200 unique non-guest users visit our four parcels and earn over 4033241 arcade tickets.\n\nYou can join and check out the Arcade [here](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-29%2C91\\&server=unicorn)\n\nAggressive bear market was a major hindrance for us, forcing us to take on different extra projects for other groups in order to keep afloat, slowing our work on Oasis. We understand that DAO is currently somewhat overwhelmed with the amount of grant proposals, so we would like to know if the community is interested in what we would like to bring to the table and approve funding for us to give 101% percent of our time to Oasis Arcade.\n\nDuring our time working with Decentraland SDK we have faced many challenges and noticed other creators in the community face the same issues we did over and over - like lacking a streamlined library for minting wearables straight from the Scene to player’s wallet without requiring them to sign a message or visit a website. We have decided to start releasing tools that would improve experience for creators and developers in the community, starting with the Wearable Minting Kit we are currently working on releasing publicly on github, the very same as our scene uses. Doing this requires time and resources we would be much more comfortable dedicating if we had grant funding backing our work.\n\nOn the more substantial part of our grant request - our plans for building a new self-sustaining P2E ecosystem:\n[Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rpoVpmOfyOVbWi0DIw\\_72e4Qj2T3nE1yru0HkWb4Pjw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nOur roadmap:\n[Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PI9UQ9wIimbBLhXRHev2AborngUNqwK-pXdjvRXsChg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nOur budget breakdown:\n[Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zr347sYgJc7G0zF1zYmivfI6dT7UL9ky0xqTAV3ZC9E/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nOur discord server:\n[Link](https://discord.gg/nHZ2MA8M3w)\n\n- Submit for a grant request\n- Rework, then submit\n- Do not submit\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fdfebfc0-862b-11ed-b125-310d98b69cd1)**",

    "title": "Does the DCL Foundation's launch worlds seriously violate the rights and interests of existing landholders?",
    "body": "> by 0x2846a9bfbcaab8690b00f01d9e7f92c5ff8a58bf (dunlei)\n\nThey recently announced the launch the world beta. People can buy a name for 100 mana， and then they can get a 2x2 world for free and permanently, which is equivalent to the size of four lands. Compared with land, the world has basically the same functions except that it has no voting rights and cannot be displayed on the map. Although the world can only allow 100 concurrent accesses, no land has ever had 100 concurrent accesses so far, so this restriction is meaningless. Because the name can be sold in unlimited quantities, it means that the world is unlimited. So, are the rights and interests of the existing land holders seriously eroded as a result? Because for newcomers who can get the world at a very low cost, why should they buy expensive land? Even renting is unwise. As early contributors, the land holders, especially the small land holders, felt betrayed and abandoned: they thought they were buying limited edition assets and could benefit from them as the project grew, but now the new worlds has greatly diluted their rights and interests. This is very unfair. The DCL Foundation used technical means to circumvent the original commitments, which obviously violated the spirit of the contract.\n\nI am not against developing worlds, because the project needs to lower the threshold to attract more people to participate and bring prosperity, which is a good thing. However, DCL Foundation should compensate for the dilution of land holders' rights and interests, and re empower land without sacrificing the interests of early investors.\n\nAs early investors of the project, we can bear the risk of poor development of the project, but we do not want to bear the risk of infringement of rights and interests due to the breach of trust of the project fund. What do you think about the changes in the rights and interests of landholders after the launch Worlds?\n\n- Landholders' rights shall be compensated\n- Landholders' rights need not be compensated\n- Landholders' rights have not been violated\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5994d540-85be-11ed-b125-310d98b69cd1)**",

    "title": "Darkmode for DAO & Forum",
    "body": "> by 0x059d0025e4e1bb1a37f2c922e54b139bc1231ee0 (LayDeez)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Darkmode for DAO & Forum](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f58c0760-7cf5-11ed-b135-498029192bca)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe idea behind dark mode is that it reduces the light emitted by device screens while maintaining the minimum colour contrast ratios required for readability\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nDark mode is a design feature that displays a website or application's user interface using dark colors instead of light colors. It is often motivated by a desire to improve readability and reduce strain on the eyes, as well as to extend battery life on devices with OLED or AMOLED displays. Implementing dark mode on a website or application can also improve accessibility for users with certain visual impairments, as it provides higher contrast between text and the background. Ultimately, the decision to implement dark mode on a website or application should be based on the needs and preferences of the users.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nImproved readability: Dark mode can improve readability for users who are sensitive to bright or white screens, as it reduces the strain on the eyes. This is especially important for users who spend long periods of time reading or working on a computer.\n\nIncreased battery life: Dark mode can also help extend battery life on devices with OLED or AMOLED displays, as these displays use less power to display darker pixels. This can be especially important for users who rely on their devices for long periods of time and do not have access to a power source.\n\nImproved accessibility: Dark mode can also improve accessibility for users with certain visual impairments, as it provides higher contrast between text and the background. This can make it easier for these users to read and navigate the website or application.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nCreate styles for dark mode: Define the styles for your dark mode in your CSS file or include them in a style tag on your HTML page. These styles should specify the colors and fonts that you want to use for the dark mode version of your website or application.\n\nAdd a toggle button: Add a toggle button to your website or application's user interface that allows users to switch between dark and light mode. You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this toggle button and add it to your site or application.\n\nAdd JavaScript to toggle the modes: Use JavaScript to create a function that toggles the dark-mode class on the body element of the page when the toggle button is clicked. You can also use JavaScript to store the user's preference for dark or light mode in a cookie or local storage, so that the preference is remembered when the user returns to the site or application.\n\nTest the implementation: Test your dark mode implementation on different devices and browsers to ensure that it is working as expected and that the styles are applied correctly. Make any necessary adjustments to the styles or JavaScript code as needed.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nImplementing dark mode on a website or application can have a number of potential impacts, both positive and negative. Here is a detailed assessment of some of the potential impacts of implementing dark mode, based on the motivations and specifications described above:\n\nPositive impacts:\n\nImproved readability: Dark mode can improve readability for users who are sensitive to bright or white screens, reducing strain on the eyes and improving the overall user experience.\nIncreased battery life: Dark mode can help extend battery life on devices with OLED or AMOLED displays, which can be especially useful for users who rely on their devices for long periods of time and do not have access to a power source.\nImproved accessibility: Dark mode can improve accessibility for users with certain visual impairments, as it provides higher contrast between text and the background. This can make it easier for these users to read and navigate the website or application.\nNegative impacts:\n\nDecreased visibility: Dark mode can decrease visibility for users with certain visual impairments, as it reduces the contrast between text and the background. This can make it more difficult for these users to read and navigate the website or application.\nIncreased cognitive load: Dark mode can increase cognitive load for some users, as it requires more mental effort to process and read the text and graphics on the screen. This can be especially true for users who are not accustomed to using dark mode and may take some time to adjust to it.\nDecreased legibility: Dark mode can also decrease legibility for some users, especially if the font and background colors are not chosen carefully. This can make it more difficult for users to read and understand the content on the website or application.\nIn summary, implementing dark mode on a website or application can have both positive and negative impacts depending on the needs and preferences of the users. It is important to carefully consider these potential impacts and test the implementation thoroughly to ensure that it is working as intended and providing the desired benefits.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nTo implement dark mode on a website or application, the following concrete steps can be taken:\n\nConsult with community members: Consult with community members, including users and developers, to understand their needs and preferences with regard to dark mode. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, or other forms of consultation.\n\nDefine the styles for dark mode: Define the styles for your dark mode in your CSS file or include them in a style tag on your HTML page. These styles should specify the colors and fonts that you want to use for the dark mode version of your website or application.\n\nAdd a toggle button: Add a toggle button to your website or application's user interface that allows users to switch between dark and light mode. You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this toggle button and add it to your site or application.\n\nAdd JavaScript to toggle the modes: Use JavaScript to create a function that toggles the dark-mode class on the body element of the page when the toggle button is clicked. You can also use JavaScript to store the user's preference for dark or light mode in a cookie or local storage, so that the preference is remembered when the user returns to the site or application.\n\nTest the implementation: Test your dark\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, dark mode is a popular design feature that can improve readability, extend battery life, and improve accessibility for some users. However, it can also decrease visibility, increase cognitive load, and decrease legibility for other users. Implementing dark mode on a website or application involves defining the styles for dark mode, adding a toggle button, adding JavaScript to toggle the modes, and testing the implementation. It is important to consult with community members, including users and developers, to understand their needs and preferences with regard to dark mode, and to carefully consider the potential impacts of the implementation. By following these steps, you can successfully implement dark mode on your website or application and improve the overall user experience.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=c5da64d0-859c-11ed-b125-310d98b69cd1)**",

    "body": "> by 0x7e22d9514a99793e80d4fb5e3a9dfd4931f47c4c (TonyDarko#7c4c)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nVtubing application that will allow for different uses expanding the digital identity even outside of decentraland. The web 3 vtubing application will offer the possibility of maintaining a digital identity based on the Decentraland avatar, expanding customization options for users and providing the community with the opportunity to design, mint, and sell these assets, generating new interactions in the marketplace.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n57,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x7e22d9514a99793E80D4FB5E3A9Dfd4931F47c4c\n\n## Email address\n\ntonydarko.venta@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\nVtubing has gained a lot of popularity in recent years. Our interest is in providing an easy-to-use application that allows the community to use a Decentraland avatar in meetings, record content, stream, etc. In addition, we propose a web 3 integration in the application, thus generating a new category of NFTs called “Decentraland Backgrounds”. Being NFTs, will have the rarity categories in same way that wearables, the interested in creating their backgrounds would have to pay a verification fee and the Decentraland committee will verify that the measures, content, format and weight of the images are appropriate for verification, the verification fee will be defined by the DAO. Our interest is in being able to provide an easy-to-use application, capable of tracking facial expressions as well as head and arm movement, and also allowing for aesthetic changes to the avatar, allowing the community to use a Decentraland avatar in meetings, recording content, streaming, etc. In addition, by integrating web 3, we propose the possibility of minting backgrounds in the application, thereby generating a new category of NFTs called “Decentraland Backgrounds.”\nThese backgrounds give the community the option to create and sell these assets, just like emotes or wearables, adding more transactions and uses to the marketplace.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n*   The user interface will allow you to change aspects such as skin tone, clothing, and hair, just as you can in the Decentraland interface. These changes will not be NFTs; they will be part of the same application and will not be the same attributes as the application, although they will be inspired by them.\n\n*   Full screen & green screen, This option is very versatile and has many uses.\n\n*   The backgrounds, being NFTs, will have the same rarity categories as the other NFTs in the community, which opens the possibility of not only identifying yourself in your digital identity with a Decentraland avatar, but also with other communities, just like wearables do, but in this case, not only within Decentraland.\n\n*   In the same way that wearables, the community interested in creating their backgrounds would have to pay a verification fee and the Decentraland committee will verify that the measures, content, format and weight of the images are appropriate for verification, the verification fee will be defined by the DAO and the sale price for each background by the community.\n\n*   This same principle can be applied to future actions within the same application, for now we would set the foundations of a tool of great usefulness not only for the Decentraland community, but also for the web 3 community in general, attracting more users to Decentraland.\n\n*   In our vision of the app, we would like to add the same concept of NFT to VRM avatars created by the community and a series of extras that will be present in the future, however it is important to develop the foundations correctly with the corresponding time.\n\nFull document: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GMH6Be9oqLS09LWBsZvfbsRkFr4V_XQS/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nMeet Tony Darko (Project Manager, 3D Designer) Graphic Designer with over 4 years of experience with Blender, creator of Darko Studio, Designer for \"Calaverse,\" festival in DCL, verified partner for the DAO proposal, selected for MVFW 2022 and DCL Film Club 2022, part of the Imagine to Create project (DCL galery/launcher), my 3D work has been exhibited at theaterLab in New York (2021) and in the Luminaria Contemporary Arts Festival in Texas.\n\n*   3D general:\n    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V2FdnMgFAojBO_mcliDT5HtLPepmyVcQ\n*   Calaverse: https://twitter.com/decentraland/status/1587746347888910336 https://market.decentraland.org/collections/0x60a203c13c9a37f0c351febb63011aaf2c2b1adc\n\nMeet Jhoico (game developer/programmer): 15 years of experience in software, website, app, and video game development, I have spent around 12 years creating web content, browser-based video games,  knowledge in  Flash, HTML, JavaScript (typescript), PHP, CSS, Flex, Xcode.

The 3D models compatible with these libraries must be able to be used with the OSC protocol, which is why we decided to use VRM formats in a unity build. This way, we control the movement of the head and arms of the avatar in real time, for the facial expressions, the models must have shapekeys for each expression, these shapekeys have a range of 0 to 1 and will be controlled by the information obtained thanks to the OSC directly from any camera. The breakdown of operations is as follows:\n\n*   March 1st: We will present the user interface, including how icons and menus will look within the app, as well as the base avatars that will be available for use within the application (including accessories, hair, and clothing).\n*   May 1st: We will present the first beta, along with the necessary documentation for the community to use it. It is necessary to ensure that the application functions correctly and meets the specified requirements. This includes testing for functionality and performance to ensure that the application runs smoothly and efficiently. It is also important to test the application on different devices and platforms to ensure that it works correctly on all of them.\n*   July 1st: The version presented on this day will be the optimized version based on the problems detected and solved.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ca629c20-8317-11ed-b125-310d98b69cd1)**",

The collection was generated with more than 500 unique wearable items, each created from Ha Jung-Woo's original art works. The collection features the unique style of Ha Jung Woo’s artwork in the form of NFTs that embodies the beauty and diversity of what Supernormal stands for. Because there is a very limited supply of only 978 NFTs, you will be provided with a rare opportunity of enjoying multiple linked wearable items that allows your Decentraland avatars to look like your Ha Jung-Woo X SuperNormal PFP.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nFashion allows people to express themselves and their identities without saying a word.\nOur mission is to keep generating digital wearables so that Decentraland players can enjoy beautiful and unique wearables that we will continuously be creating.\n\nAvant Garde is increasing partnerships with various artists and fashion brands to generate more digital wearables to present more variations of wearable items. We hope Decentraland will become our main stage for releasing upcoming collections as well.\n\nWe will never stop until people can fully express themselves in metaverse games.

This will require a voice artificial intelligence system that understands natural language and replies to users through speech.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xb350fb0ee5da6485a07b58f1f204d248863e8e04\n\n## Email address\n\nilyaspirin94@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n\nConversational AI can be used to power voice assistants or chatbots  in Decentraland in such cases as:\n\n*   Automate FAQs and users' onboarding process with a voice-powered assistant (to help visitors at events, games, shops, etc.)\n*   Create AI-driven in-game characters\n*   Automate sales interactions (take payments, check refund statuses, balances and more)\n*   Power smart real estate agents (deliver information on parcel location, property details etc. )\n*   Create a Siri-like voice assistant that helps users navigate around Decentraland\n*   Many other things, just like in the real world\n\n    \\\n     \n\n**Working prototype**\n\n[Try it here](https://dcl.voctiv.com/) (loads 3-5 minutes).\n\nInstructions to use the prototype:\n\n1.  Allow your browser to use your microphone when requested\n2.  Approach the NPC (the dog) - if you are close enough a pop-up with “Hello” will appear. This will launch the voice bot\n3.  Wait for the voice greeting from the NPC\n4.  You may ask the NPC the following questions:\n    *   Who are you?\n    *   What is your name?\n    *   How are you?\n    *   How many players are online?\n    *   Which districts are presented in Decentraland?\n    *   Where I can buy some art or NFTs?\n    *   Any great events (happening)?\n    *   Where I can go? What is interesting right now?\n5.  When finished you can say “goodbye” to the NPC\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/wRy2vYN/dcl-mvp.png \"Screenshot of prototype\")\n\n**Decription**\n\nWe are going to develop a package that will:\n\n*   Grab voice from the DCL scene\n*   Pass the voice to Middleware\n*   Connect Middleware to a number of existing platforms with speech-to-text engines and natural language understanding engine capabilities, where the voice would be processed and return a result and commands back to Decentraland\n*   According to the command received from the platform by Decentraland, the voice bot will continue communication with the user and proceed with all necessary transactions if needed\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe will create a new Voice Bot  Module for Decentraland Kernel and provide access from the ECS directly or via Content Server. A 3rd-party server could be set up, for example, in the NPC object definition or any other object in the scene. We are planning to extend an Entity class to do that.\n\nWe are also going to create an RTC Server for handling user requests with integration modules to external services: Google Dialogflow, Microsoft Azure Bot, Amazon Lex, and Voctiv. Modules for Dialogflow, Azure Bot, and Amazon Lex will be published on Github, so users can build a voice bot with such services by themselves.\n\nRTC Server and connector modules will be implemented in Python.

    "body": "> by 0x60206b4b0eeefed1c5fb8f755527f72fa872b143 (Pdubverse)\n\nMy name is Pdub and I have been apart of the Decentraland community since 2020. I own POI Pdubverse. Back in 2020 I started out with 1 parcel and traded my way up to a 16 parcel estate in a span of 2 years.\n\nWith the new Decentraland Worlds Beta announcement the only thing that rubbed me the wrong way is that we are allowing someone with only a 100 mana name to create a build that will allow up to 100 visitors at a time (4 parcels is alot of space if you level up.) If you go to the Places tab the only location that consistently has over 100 visitors at a time is The Stronghold for Ice Poker.\n\nWhat is preventing someone going overboard by creating a few names, having multiple Decentraland World locations, and only doing it for a couple hundred mana? Not to mention that person/company may never buy land in Decentraland because what is the point when you can do what you need to do for 100 mana.\n\nDepending on  how this poll turns out then maybe we should re-review  the number of allowed visitors for Decentraland Worlds Beta. I'm curious to hear everyones thoughts. Thanks for reading.\n\n- Fair\n- Not Fair\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d717d780-8189-11ed-8fa2-17dd3f32db26)**",

I helped with the development of the bronze age  [node](https://github.com/decentraland/bronzeage-node/commits?author=martriay)  and  [editor](https://github.com/decentraland/bronzeage-editor/commits?author=martriay)  (aka Decentraland pre-ethereum).\n\nAfter that I became Decentraland’s first community manager, moderating the community chat which happened to be a Slack server back then. During that time, I oversaw and coordinated the deployment of content to the bronze age Decentraland world.\n\nSince then I have taken a passive role in the community, mainly as a user. I own the  [martriay DCL name 3](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8/42873846468593917260867995959418804692101856404848732244358265591503736392720)  and like to party in Decentraland with my homies 😎\n\n**What skills, qualifications, and experience will you bring to the committee?**\nI’ve worked full time in the web3 security ecosystem for the past 6 years in roles ranging from head of marketing to software developer, where I had to develop smart contract libraries ( [openzeppelin-solidity](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commits?author=martriay) ,  [openzeppelin-cairo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/commits?author=martriay) ), block explorers ( [forta](https://github.com/forta-network/forta-interface/commits?author=martriay) ,  [flashbots](https://flashbots-explorer.marto.lol/) ), audit smart contracts,  [define industry standards](https://community.starknet.io/t/universal-deployer-contract-proposal/1864) ,  [fuel communities](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/introduce-yourself-here/88?u=martriay) , create  [free educational content](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCna6AP0MPS8e453WJt4G42A) ,  [speak at conferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_gwNW3Fw) , among a few other things.\n\nAll in all I count with the technical know-how to securely execute and improve DAO operations, as well as with enough community experience to properly and transparently communicate them.\n\nI believe DAO committees hold a lot of power – therefore responsibility, and my goal is to minimize it through automation, with a strong focus on security and transparency.\n\n**Can you commit at least 5 hours per week to the DAO?**\\\nYes\n\n**Provide links to any relevant social media profiles or other information:**\n\n*   https://twitter.com/martriay\n*   https://github.com/martriay\n*   https://marto.lol\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO Committee should be conformed of 3 members elected by the Community.\n\nHistorical Context:\n\n*   [Resignation of Eric to the DAO Committee](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/resignation-from-the-dao-committee/4705) .\n*   [Formalization of the process for adding and removing members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1) .\n*   [Formalization of compensation for committee members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fa6a3040-338a-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8) .\n*   [Open Call for new committee members](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569/11) .\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe process is well specified in  [the governance proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)  mentioned earlier. Here are some excerpts related to the final vote:\n\n*The process for adding a committee member includes three stages: the open application period, the committee interviews, and a final vote by ranked choice.*\n\n*After the interview phase, the DAO Committee is responsible for creating a final proposal in the DAO listing their picks for the top 5 candidates.*\n\n*If the DAO decides not to implement support for ranked choice voting,***then separate proposals could be created for each individual***candidate selected by the DAO Committee after the interview stage.*\n\nSince Ranked Voting has not been implemented in the Governance dApp yet, the DAO Committee created 5 Governance Proposals, one per each candidate. By the end of the votation, the proposal that reaches the participation threshold and has the most positive voting power will be considered the winner.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nAdd a new member to the DAO Committee.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nThe Security Advisory Board and the current DAO Committee will grant privileges to the new member.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOver the past year, the DAO Committee has been proven essential for the regular operations of the DAO. Adding a new member should improve the security and decentralization of the DAO.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=31bf25c0-8154-11ed-8fa2-17dd3f32db26)**",

This early interaction with the Decentraland DAO gave me great insights into the functioning of the DAO and mechanics behind it.\\\nSince then, the project I started has grown into the Wilderness P2E game and I have spent all this time building on Decentraland, engaging with the community and observing the different aspects of Decentraland evolve.\\\nI had then applied successfully for a Tier 6 grant for expansion of Wilderness P2E in May 2022 which again gave me new insights into the DAO and taught me a lot about gathering support, handling criticism positively, understanding the point of views of different stakeholders in the Decentraland ecosystem and much more.\\\nAs a member of the DAO, I have been regularly involved in DAO discussions, helping people understand the processes and contributing my views on key topics.\n\n**What skills, qualifications, and experience will you bring to the committee?**\n\\* Educational Qualification : B. Tech. in Engineering (Mechanical) from IIT Kanpur, 2017\n\\* Work Experience : 5 years of experience working in Agile teams at Tech. companies of different sizes, from being a startup founder and working in 2-3 people teams, to working at Gartner, a multinational corporation.\n\nI am currently working as the co-founder for the Wilderness P2E \\[-25,90 DCL] for the past one year, wearing multiple hats every day including that of a developer, discord moderator, project manager and more.\n\nMy relevant skills for this role involve :\n\n*   Coding Smart Contracts, Management tools and Automating Operational Tasks\n*   Discourse Management\n*   Documentation\n*   Leading and Managing projects in agile and remote teams.\n\n**Can you commit at least 5 hours per week to the DAO?**\\\nYes\n\n**Provide links to any relevant social media profiles or other information:**\n\n*   Twitter :  <https://twitter.com/palryan>\n*   LinkedIn :  <https://www.linkedin.com/in/palryan/>\n*   Medium :  [0xChamp.dcl.eth](https://medium.com/@0xChamp_DCL/)\n\n**Provide a list of two references, that can attest to your character and commitment to Decentraland**\n\n*   [@dax](https://forum.decentraland.org/u/dax)\n*   [Neyha](https://twitter.com/neyyyhaaa)\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO Committee should be conformed of 3 members elected by the Community.\n\nHistorical Context:\n\n*   [Resignation of Eric to the DAO Committee](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/resignation-from-the-dao-committee/4705) .\n*   [Formalization of the process for adding and removing members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1) .\n*   [Formalization of compensation for committee members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fa6a3040-338a-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8) .\n*   [Open Call for new committee members](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569/11) .\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe process is well specified in  [the governance proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)  mentioned earlier.

In that sense, I always need to be updated on what’s going on, including the DAO. I already spend time here reading, voting and following proposals.\n\n**What is your history with both Decentraland and Decentraland’s DAO?**\\\nI joined Decentraland in 2021 and I was able to create one of the most popular YouTube channels focused on this platform. Not only I have onboarded multiple players, but also I’ve created multiple videos for companies and projects inside DCL (including The Decentraland Foundation, where I still collaborate). Today I’m focused on making the information accessible on Unversed, a wiki that I have created where multiple collaborators contribute by adding articles: https://unversed.org\n\nIn regards to the DAO, I have been participating for more than a year. I always found it an amazing phenomenon that represents a new way of doing politics on the internet. I really advocate for decentralization and I’m always learning how to contribute to it.\n\nMy first proposal was about developing a low-latency stream and while at that time it didn’t pass, now there is a project inspired by that.\n\nI normally try to vote for projects that show creativity but also make sense for the platform. I’m not a big fan of Play2Earns (mostly when they are Ponzi / Pay2Win) and I prioritize tools that help creators create better content. I try to give feedback each time and I’m always 100% open to changing my mind.\n\n**What skills, qualifications, and experience will you bring to the committee?**\nI can create professional videos, see: (https://youtube.com/TobikCC) // (https://decentralfun.com)\nI can do an analysis of what’s going on in Decentraland due to my knowledge of the community (We must solve this, so Decentraland will succeed | Unversed)\\\nI’m able to create tutorials and didactic information.\n\n**Can you commit at least 5 hours per week to the DAO?**\\\nI already spend a lot of time in Decentraland, so yes.\n\n**Provide links to any relevant social media profiles or other information:**\n\n*   Twitter: https://twitter.com/TobikCC\n*   YouTube: https://youtube.com/TobikCC\n*   Unversed: https://unversed.org https://www.youtube.com/@unversed1106\n*   Some videos I made for companies and projects: https://decentralfun.com\n*   A video I made for The Foundation: https://twitter.com/decentraland/status/1587562329394118656\n*   My personal website: https://tobik.cc\n\n**--> [Continue Reading](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569/11): <--**\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO Committee should be conformed of 3 members elected by the Community.\n\nHistorical Context:\n\n*   [Resignation of Eric to the DAO Committee](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/resignation-from-the-dao-committee/4705) .\n*   [Formalization of the process for adding and removing members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1) .\n*   [Formalization of compensation for committee members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fa6a3040-338a-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8) .\n*   [Open Call for new committee members](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569/11) .\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe process is well specified in  [the governance proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)  mentioned earlier.

I think it is very important that we ensure that the decentralized metaverse is the one that will gain mainstream adoption. Having 5+ years of experience in investing and researching in the cryptocurrency_blockchain field, I think I have gained valuable knowledge that will help with Decentralands governance and proposal discussions_votes.\n\n**What is your history with both Decentraland and Decentraland’s DAO?**\\\nI have been involved with Decentraland since the initial land sale (the Terraform Event back in 2017). I invested in both land and the museum district. Originally I had a gallery built on my original land that I bought during the auction. Since then we have moved the gallery to my brothers land, where we are using it to build The Ocean Meta project. Our current goal with The Ocean Meta project is to onboard the ocean community to Decentraland, everything from the underwater world to surfing. We have a combined following between The Ocean Meta team of over 190,000 people that are interested in ocean related content who we will be onboarding as Decentraland and The Ocean Meta becomes more developed.\n\n**What skills, qualifications, and experience will you bring to the committee?**\n\n*   5+ years of investing_research in the blockchain_crypto field\n*   Professional Photography and Videography (with featured work on Discovery Channels Shark Week, National Geographic, and many other publications)\n*   Photoshop, Premiere, Blender\n*   Social Media Management_Marketing_Growth\n*   Currently studying Javascript programming\n\n**Can you commit at least 5 hours per week to the DAO?**\\\nYes, even more if needed.\n\n**Provide links to any relevant social media profiles or other information that will help the community when evaluating candidates.**\n\n*   <https://www.instagram.com/szjanko/>\n*   [Szilard Janko](https://www.szjanko.com/)\n\n**Provide a list of two references, at least one of which is in the Decentraland community that can attest to your character and/or commitment to Decentraland.**\n\n*   Maryana  <https://twitter.com/maryanaDCL>\n*   Canessa  <https://twitter.com/CanessaDCL>\n*   Yannakis  <https://twitter.com/yannakis_dcl>\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO Committee should be conformed of 3 members elected by the Community.\n\nHistorical Context:\n\n*   [Resignation of Eric to the DAO Committee](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/resignation-from-the-dao-committee/4705) .\n*   [Formalization of the process for adding and removing members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1) .\n*   [Formalization of compensation for committee members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fa6a3040-338a-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8) .\n*   [Open Call for new committee members](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569/11) .\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe process is well specified in  [the governance proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)  mentioned earlier.

There are people connecting wallets to the vesting contracts. Living, breathing, Decentralites log into the world and develop friendships through shared experiences. Experiences made possible and enriched by grants provided via the DCL DAO. I would like to be a liaison between community members and the stack of rules governing DCL. I am patient, considerate, and attentive. As an educator with over seven years of experience I can also be a “warm demander”.\n\n**What is your history with both Decentraland and Decentraland’s DAO?**\\\nI first logged into Decentraland on 17 December 2021. I purchased my DCL.ETH name 11 days after that. Within my first week here I began making my first wearable. When I had difficulty I created  [a post in the forums about my experience](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/wearable-not-visible-in-dcl-builder/4048)  so that others might learn from my mistakes.\n\nI hosted “ [Finding Whimsy](https://twitter.com/AwedJob/status/1516551775859482624?s=20\\&t=cDy3LNz7VaT16O0ZqYnonw) ,” my first event in DCL, in April 2022. The event had over 30 participants who searched in pairs for more than three hours to find Whimsy, the faerie queen. Everyone who found her won a legendary Flower Crown.\n\nOn 2 May 2022 I joined BillyTeacoin and CKBubbles as cohost for the weekly, Twitch-streamed program, ABC Decentraland Adventures. We recently completed our 29th consecutive episode. Every Monday night we have a special guest who tells us about their activation or build in Decentraland. We spend the remainder of the time visiting new and interesting places among the 90,000 parcels in DCL.\n\nI posted  [my first poll](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/dao-qmxv53p-should-the-dao-increase-the-variety-and-number-of-an-avatars-facial-physical-trait-to-represent-all-people/5011)  in the DAO on 5 January 2022. The biggest lesson I took away from that experience was I needed to learn more about the DAO and how it operated.\nFrom that moment to this I have participated in discussions in the DCL DAO discord. I’ve voted on and commented on proposals presented in the governance site. I’ve advocated studied options and advocated for VP equity. I provided feedback and testing for approved grant projects like the Quest 2 VR Client.\n\n**--> [Continue Reading](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569/6) <--**\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO Committee should be conformed of 3 members elected by the Community.\n\nHistorical Context:\n\n*   [Resignation of Eric to the DAO Committee](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/resignation-from-the-dao-committee/4705) .\n*   [Formalization of the process for adding and removing members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1) .\n*   [Formalization of compensation for committee members](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=fa6a3040-338a-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8) .\n*   [Open Call for new committee members](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569/11) .\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe process is well specified in  [the governance proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=359eee30-cacc-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)  mentioned earlier.

    "title": "Add Actual 3D Punks to the Linked Wearables Registry",
    "body": "> by 0xdd6714db8ebeeb41160df4bb3589a0bef3c09fd3 (Ant28)\n\nShould Actual 3D Punks be added to the Linked Wearables Registry?\n\n## NFT Marketplace Listing\n\n- https://opensea.io/collection/actual-3d-punks\n\n\n## Relevant Links\n\n- https://twitter.com/Actual3DPunks\n\n\n## NFT Collections Description\n\nHello! :wave:\n\nMy name is Anthony Liardo. Here’s more info about my project:\n\nshorturl.at/nILT7\n\nThis proposal is for Actual 3D Punks to become a linked wearable in DCL. It's a good example of a collection that the linked wearable system was made for in the first place. As is clear, anyone can create a DCL wearable, but the point of the linked wearables is to wear the more-official/more-rare NFTs that only holders of the NFT can wear.\nActual 3D Punks are only going to the owners of the legitimate CryptoPunk. I have had 29 CryptoPunks holders claim their 3D punks so far, and the number is growing.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nI’ve had multiple punk owners ask about wearing the NFT in CV. However, CV has no plans to implement .glb 3D NFTs into their world, but I know DCL uses .glb. This is why I'm making my 1st official proposal for linking these NFTs with your metaverse.\nI really believe it would be beneficial to everyone to link this project as a wearable, as it would get CryptoPunks owners who haven’t tried your metaverse to begin exploring. This could obviously lead to more revenue for DCL and the DAO as the potential 3,600 punk-owners each have a probability of buying a parcel or doing other marketplace activity (if they aren’t already).\n\nI would love to discuss this more with members of the community in the comments!\n\n\n## Items to be Uploaded\n\n10000\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nhttps://licenseterms.cryptopunks.app/\n\nI, Anthony Liardo, do not own the intellectual property of punks, but I am withholding the 3D version of punk NFTs for the rightful owner of the IP. The blockchain verifies that the tokens transferred out of the deployer address (except to 0xf7dEe..) have gone to wallets associated with the original punk.\nThese 3D versions of CryptoPunks will only go to the owner of the IP unless explicitly written that they may be used otherwise.\n\n\n## Smart Contract Address\n\n- 0xE55eF44bE672Ff4557931Eb9ef91A42d8C9A0d6C\n\n\n## Manager Address\n\n- 0xdd6714db8ebeeb41160df4bb3589a0bef3c09fd3\n\n\n## Is this collection generated programmatically?\n- Yes\n\n\n## Method\n\nHere's the full link (not shortened) to my manifesto:\n\nhttps://mirror.xyz/0xdd6714db8EBEEB41160dF4bB3589A0BeF3c09Fd3/VORvqMcFLCkcFSAG4OSjUyPmJSp-P_Vhx6Ihxeh8yoE\n\nAs mentioned there, I used BlendMyNFTs by Torrin Leonard! I also wrote some Python scripts to work with the metadata/NFTs. Here's a Github of the scripts I wrote (very basic, but I've made it in an effort to show my work in the long-term):\nhttps://github.com/AnthonyLia/python-scripts-2022\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9e6d9680-8004-11ed-8fa2-17dd3f32db26)**",

It would be nice for people not to have to say who they are known as under other names. Plus it will remove confusion for players and constant dao voters. I propose to put forth a poll on this topic. Some may think this might not matter because you can go to opensea. This would however potentially eliminate that step and also prevent malice that could happen. Especially from people using Nfts to impersonate other people, groups or collectives.\n\nShould we create and use  dao forum name handles.  Not have dao forum handle names linked to the set name nft.\n\n- Yes create and use set forum names. Dont use set nfts\n- No dont use forum names.

However, I think these linked wearables can be helpful for big projects. It would be good to give the projects an option to pay for it themselves.\nThis is the proposal that would be amended. https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f69c4d40-aaaf-11ec-87a7-6d2a41508231\n\nThe line that should be amended in this governance proposal is:\n\n\"Curation fees are covered by the DAO and will be the same amount as regular wearables, so for a curator, it shouldn’t matter what type of collection it is.\"\n\nInstead I think we should offer 2 options:\n\nOption 1: Linked wearables curation fees are funded by the DAO.\n\nOption 2: Linked wearables curation fees are funded by the wearables creator.\n\nSome companies or NFT Projects don't mind paying the fees, they just want their wearables in world and linked to their NFT's traits.

We have a very active community, with a discord of over 80,000 verified members. To engage and educate our community, Clipper runs quarterly Adventures.  Adventures are an immersive experience that are a cross between a digital scavenger hunt and a Harry Potter Hogwarts House cup.  In each adventure there are several teams, consisting of Ships, Captains, and their crew of pirates. The Ships race through activities in the digital world to try to complete quests designed to teach them about our shared decentralized space.\n\nClipper would like to partner with Decentraland for a scavenger hunt as a basis for our next adventure in February 2023.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n30,300 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x1113DB6080ea2B9f92B2e9937ea712b3d730b3F1\n\n## Email address\n\nben@shipyardsoftware.org\n\n## Description\n\n[Clipper Adventures](https://blog.clipper.exchange/adventure-3-building-clippertopia/) are rich with worldbuilding, and have an extensive [backstory](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eayIAvBrk_R8IuIfGm0\\_is1JJqGBI213W7-CgsbwMU0/edit?usp=sharing).  Each of the six ships has an origin story with a legendary captain and a unique item of power.  For the Decentraland themed adventure, the crux of the story would be that the crew of the six ships enter Decentraland after being told that their Item of Power has been stolen. They are now tasked with retrieving it! Pirates will be given six clues, each clue leads to a separate location within the world.  Once they solve the clue’s riddle and reach the intended location, they will be met with a small treasure hunt.  Shards of the item of power will be scattered across that location. Once all shards are found, a kiosk will appear, and after entering the correct password (told to them by their Captains in Clipper Community) they will be granted with an NFT wearable that represents the item of power.  If a pirate is able to solve all six treasure-hunts and collect all six items of power, they may return to the starting point and retrieve a SuperUser reward.\n\nOur most recent adventure (Nov-Dec 2022) had [30,000](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/999329098851684422/1041701754007474276/image.png)  user signups. These are active, knowledgeable Web3 participants.  All are familiar with and use their web3 wallets, and are excited to learn about various quests the Clipper team designs for them.\n\nThe principal activity planned for February 2023 would be sending our users to Decentraland for a scavenger hunt.  Fun, educational exploratory activity for our adventures which boosts Decentraland’s network activity and gains long term users!\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Product Design ($10,200)**\n\n*(As quoted by competitive T1 design company in the space)*\n\nStarting location design ($1000)\n\nInitial wearable design ($400)\n\n[2D → 3D design models for the Item of power (x6) (6x$400 = 2400)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/933576620411854888/1054488042854948944/image.png)\n\n*   Dao Shi Tong’s Sextant for the Fleet Elite\n*   Jason’s Divine Ram Head from the Amaranth Argo\n*   Mora Moonsinger’s Moonscythe from the Sapphire Sphynx\n*   King Midas’s Philosopher’s Stone from the Golden Galleon\n*   Defi Jones Locker from the Flying Dutchman\n*   Chih Shing’s Jeweled Bloody Sword from the Bloodsail Bandit\n\nVegas City Gamification ($6000)\n\nSuperuser reward for the Pirates that completes all 6 treasure hunts ($400)\n\n**Clipper <> Decentraland Integration ($5,800)**\n\n*   Developer work to integrate [Clipper inventory screen](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948252711298662501/1053158743912751164/image.png) with Decentraland ($5,000)\n*   Storyboarding ($800)\n\n**Community Management ($6,800)**\n\n*   Social media amplification and promotion ($2000)\n*   Compensation for 24 captains (4 captains x 6 ships) - $4800\n\n**New user acquisition ($7,500)**\n\nFor our most recently completed Clipper Adventure, we capped sign-ups at 30,000 and hit those numbers within a week of opening regular access. Regular signups were free, and even still we had an early-access sign up week, where we sold 5,000 early access tickets for $10.  We sold out of those in 12 hours.  We expect that we should have similar numbers for a joint event in Decentraland.  Even with one quarter the level of enthusiastic participation, we would see 7,500 web3 native users signing up for the Decentraland event.  7,500 Web3 native users sent to Decentraland and have them explore over the course of weeks, enough time to build habit and become long term users.  7,500 savvy users x $1 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) = $7,500.  We expect this CAC to be variable. If fewer come, the grant would pay less money.  If more come, the grant would increase to cover those members.\n\n*Adventures require enormous effort from the team at Shipyard/Clipper. During the month long Adventures, nearly half of our team of 12 works on these events full-time. And it doesn’t include the work spent in advance planning and developing. Prices are estimates and likely underestimate fully-loaded costs given the efforts of the company and the amount of man-hours dedicated to pulling off successful adventures.*\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n[Mark Lurie - CEO, Shipyard Software](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mlurie/)\n\n[Ben Klein - Head of Community, Clipper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benklein0/)\n\n[Temo - Senior Software Engineer, Shipyard Software](https://www.linkedin.com/in/t3m0/)\n\n[Drew Tozer - Head of Design, Shipyard Software](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-tozer-8b9671144/)\n\n[James Ashton - CEO, Vegas City Limited](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesashton/)\n\nPaul Singleton, Technical Project Manager, Vegas City Limited\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n*   90 Days for planning, development, implementation, and execution\n*   By Jan 15 - Completed story line\n*   By Jan 30 - completed Items of Powers and wearables\n*   By Feb 15 - completed started location design and build; completed build of six Item of Power locations\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f624be20-7fd8-11ed-8fa2-17dd3f32db26)**",

At this time, high traffic on the platform is derived from either play to earn gamified scenes or specific music events. Those very music events are a focal point for proving the merit of the metaverse itself and is our central focus here at MultiNFT as we will demonstrate below.\nLaunched in 2018, MultiNFT is one of the founding members of the Metaverse revolution. With an extensive network of connections and expertise in the real-world music industry, MultiNFT delivers the best events the metaverse has to offer and provides a familiar environment for communities to grow in.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x231E679B29bF1659560305e801E323a6900D1492\n\n## Email address\n\nguy@multinft.io\n\n## Description\n\nOver the past year alone, MultiNFT has produced and delivered a medley of top visited events in the Decentraland metaverse and broke the marketplace charts several times with its wearables.

    "title": "Temporarily Pausing the uptake of new Decentraland Grants",
    "body": "> by 0xaca8fbbdddfce169114f344d8ee739bde665f4f4 (Seanny)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Temporarily Pausing the uptake of new Decentraland Grants](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2b2a3f40-7035-11ed-beaf-a14520403f7b)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe approval of this governance proposal is the final step necessary in pausing the uptake of new Grant Proposals in the Decentraland Grants System for a *2 Month Period*, starting on the **1st of January**, up until the **28th of February**.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe poll and draft setting this governance proposal led to open dialogue where multiple different members of the community brought opinions, information, and added value towards discussing the future of the Decentraland DAO.\n\nIn the spirit of agency, this draft proposal aims to add more of a focus on the question at hand:\n\n> Should we temporarily pause DCL's grants programme until Q1 2023?\n\nThrough this proposal, we wish to propose the following action points:\n\n*   Temporarily pause the uptake of new grant proposals;\n*   Ensure the pause does not negatively harm the creative community;\n*   Provide some time to the DAO Governance Squad to implement changes on Decentralised Governance being discussed.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nGovernance is a fundamental part of our DAO, and a *two-month* pause in our grants system can give the DCL Community a chance to turn its energy toward passing a multitude of upcoming governance decisions.\n\nOn the horizon, we have upcoming decisions for:\n\n*   Restructuring of the Community Grants Program:\n    https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e2fbd710-426c-11ed-9eb2-21be7ab68113\n*   Grant Revocation Committee:\n    https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ced918f0-6b85-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598\n*   Implementing a Bidding and Tendering process:\\\n    https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ce730570-6053-11ed-bf97-7dbf9f54c71d\n*   Denomination of Names:\n    https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=2ad02720-6f1e-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598\n*   Land Concessions:\n    https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=cb5488d0-5399-11ed-be45-c5d5549af004\n\n*...and that's just to point out a few.*\n\nAll debates, discussions, and interests aside; this proposal reaffirms the belief that voting on grants requires constant, arduous contributions from the DAO; at the expense of attention, time, and energy. A pause in voting on grant-focused decisions is an opportunity for delegates and voters to *breathe* and take stock of all the decisions they have taken over the past months.\n\nAs DAO voters, a pause would allow the time and space to look back at the stands we have taken, with the curiosity of knowing how our decisions played out over time.\n\nRemember; within a DAO, you are far more similar to a parliamentarian than you are to a citizen within a state. Decision fatigue is a serious risk that we would be intelligent to avoid.\n\nA pause in our grants system is the perfect opportunity to both reflect on our past decisions, whilst also shifting our collective focus on the most important decisions we have to collectively make.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n**Proposed Plan of Action**\n\nThe Final Governance vote shall approve the **pause of the update of new grants**, and shall be enacted in practice by Decentraland's Governance Squad.\n\nAny grants approved before the 31st of December, 2022, will remain entirely *unaffected* by this pause. Any Grantees wishing to apply for Decentraland-backed funding will have the first opportunity to do so again on the 1st of March, 2023. The pause will remain in effect for a minimum of two months.\n\nThe pause aims to cause as little disruption as possible to the creative community, whilst simultaneously aiming to give more prioritization to upcoming governance decisions that can further empower innovators, creators, and problem solvers within our community for years to come.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe applications and impacts of this Governance Proposal are quite succinct, yet have the potential to be indirectly far-reaching in the field of consensus-building, best-practice documentation, governance development, and systematic risk mitigation in the field of DAO Asset Management.\n\n> Direct Impact\n\n***\n\nThe Decentraland Governance platform is **paused** for a two-month period, where no new Grant Proposals are taken up for debate by the Community and DAO.\n\nThis pause will effectively mean that no community member will be able to apply for Decentraland DAO funding, between the **1st of January** and the **28th of February**.\n\n> Indirect Impacts\n\n***\n\n**Consensus Building**\n\nAt a crucial point for Governance and consensus-building in our DAO, the pause can prove to be a pivotal moment in rallying the community around debates centered around the future of Decentraland, and the priorities that bind us.\n\nA two-month period dedicated to road-map ideation, governance discussions, and community-focused prioritisations can prove to be a blessing in disguise, especially in the face of recent rifts and disagreements across the DCL Community as of late.\n\nAs one can see in our Governance platform; several members of each DAO Core Unit have been discussing how best to implement a distributed visioning and strategic alignment process that is both flexible enough to embody the decentralized ethos of our community and structured enough to serve its unifying purposes. This pause will allow community stakeholders, DAO operators, and others to come together to formalize this process and work together toward not only designing the process itself but to produce some form of deliverable that represents an outcome of this process.\n\n**Best-Practice Documentation**\n\nAs a community-led initiative, this Governance Proposal can shed more light on how to best handle processes and initiatives related to regulating and developing a Decentralised Governance system.\n\n*Decentralised Decision-Making* is a relatively new concept. In the future, the pause can prove to be a defining moment for the DAO when looking back at how governance decisions can impact the community in the short and long term and can feed into our best-practice documentation from the perspective of governance and decision-making.\n\nSuch approaches are already built into traditional governance systems in the form of legislative sessions and electoral cycles; however, in persistent decentralized systems, which have little to no temporal structures to guide our operations, we seriously, face a risk of governmental decoherence without strong best-practice documentation.\n\n**Governance Development and Systematic Risk Mitigation**\n\nThe Pause will set a new precedent for the DAO, highlighting new practices, methods, and responsibilities that both community members and squad members can undertake and represent.\n\nApproving a pause in our grants system is a DAO-first, and undergoing that process will give us new information and governance experience to be able to more efficiently and effectively handle discussions and decisions such as these in the future.\n\nThis practical understanding from a *process* standpoint, coupled with a precedent set in our governance platform, will simply allow us to move swiftly and assuredly in the future should similar discussions be required in the field of systematic risk mitigation and DAO Asset Management.\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\nShould this Governance Proposal pass, the Decentraland Governance Squad would be given the green light to pause the uptake of new Decentraland Grants for a 2-month period.\n\n**Pause Timeline:**\n\n> Last day to submit a grant proposal: **31st December,** 2022 23:59PM PST\n\n> Uptake of new Grants Paused: **1st January,** 2023 00:00AM PST\n\n> Last day to vote on a grant proposal: **13th January,** 2023 23:59PM PST\n\n> Last day of Grant Paused: **28th February,** 2023 23:59PM PST\n\n> Grants Pause no Longer in Effect: **1st March,** 2023, 00:00AM PST\n\n*NB: The last day to submit a grant has been amended to the 31st of December, due to Governance Proposals taking longer to vote on that polls and drafts. These extra few days simultaneously act as a buffer-grace period for any creatives in the community that have planned to make use of the Grants Platform this year, to ensure there is ample time for community members to make use of the platform before the temporary pause.*\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe intended outcome of this entire proposal is to continue building on the great discussions had in the last poll and draft, with the ultimate aim of gathering the community together to focus on governance-based decision-making.\n\n2023 is going to be the year of the DAO, and it starts by coming together and collectively revisiting our foundations.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9f3b0be0-7e94-11ed-8750-cd1748a98b11)**",

    "body": "> by 0xfcacace2713d41c02666e2643e5583793196c935 (WonderZone)\n\nShould the following Tier 5: up to $120,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWonderMine is a social play-to-earn game where you mine meteors, collect resources and craft upgrades and rewards in the form of wearables and other NFTs. WonderMine continues to be one of the most popular locations in Decentraland, with an active and passionate community and over 1400 players per day.\n\nIn 2023, we aim to take WonderMine to the next level by introducing new multiplayer mechanics, new categories of meteors, even more wearables, enabling WonderMine as an event space and giving a fresh new look to the WonderZone Park area.\n\n[Play WonderMine at -28,55](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-28%2C55)\n\n[Join our Discord](https://wonderzone.io/discord)\n\n![WonderZone Guild House](https://wonderzone.io/img/promo/switcherui.gif)\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xfcacAcE2713D41c02666E2643E5583793196c935\n\n## Email address\n\nrob@wonderzone.io\n\n## Description\n\nWonderZone began in 2017, just as an idea by Radix to create an Amusement Park district in Decentraland. That became reality in 2018 and by 2019 the park was filled with various hackathon-winners and mini-games.\n\nWonderMine quickly became one of the most popular Decentraland games, and has become something of a staple. WonderMine is one of the first places new players visit when they enter Decentraland for the first time, a feat we’re very proud of. WonderMine playership increased steadily over time. We currently support about 1,400 players per day (DAU).\n\nSince the WonderMine alpha first launched in June 2020:\n\n*   Over **300,000 unique players** have played (mining at least one meteor)\n*   Hit a peak DAU of **over 10K players** (December 2021) without performance issues\n*   Nearly **20K wearables** (19,865) given to players who crafted them\n*   Over **3,600 WonderZone Pickaxe NFTs** given out\n*   Over **20 “2X Loot Drop” events** with 300 to 1000 players attending\n*   Over **a dozen different collab events** with projects like DG, Vroomway, MetaParty and MetaKey\n\nWonderZone received a Tier 6 grant in January 2022 with a very ambitious roadmap. We planned to hire a new developer but that didn’t pan out, so the full roadmap was more than our small team could accomplish in 6 months. Even so that grant let some of us work full-time, and since we didn’t end up hiring another game dev the funds lasted us almost a full year, instead of 6 months.\n\nHere is what we achieved in 2022:\n\n*   Developed a custom NFT smart contract (audited by Solidity Finance: https://solidity.finance/audits/WonderZone)\n*   Released the WonderZone Games NFT collection (https://opensea.io/collection/wonderzonegames)\n    *   Released 5 NFT pickaxes, with more on the way\n    *   Auto-minting when players craft an NFT pickaxe\n    *   Innovative contract supports per-item attributes and leveling-up\n*   In-game highscores (level + meteors mined)\n*   Level-locked crafting\n*   Limited item crafting (one per player)\n*   Updated UI\n    *   Improved meteor loot pop-up\n    *   Pickaxe switching functionality\n*   Backend event manager (work in progress)\n    *   Hub for WZ staff with data dashboards\n    *   Easier and quicker to host events in WonderMine\n    *   Faster support ticket processing\n*   WonderZone Guild House building\n    *   A central hub for the WonderZone Amusement park\n    *   More buildings in development\n*   Many, many, many new WonderZone wearables\n*   Seasonal wearables, an organized way of releasing wearable collections\n    *   Each season contains 10 new wearables every 2 months\n    *   Offered Seasonal Airdrop Pass NFTs, another step towards self-sufficiency for WonderZone\n*   Hired part-time back-end developer/Azure expert\n    *   Refactored back-end/server infrastructure for performance and better internal testing\n    *   Improved CoinCart process\n\nWe have learned a lot in 2022. We feel more confident in our abilities to deliver on our more realistic goals and milestones. These are features we believe will elevate the current singleplayer mining experience and help us attract new players to the WonderMine game and to Decentraland.\n\nOur goals for WonderMine were to create a game that’s fun to come back to every day and to become a social hub where people hang out in Decentraland, mining and chatting. We feel we’ve been successful with these goals. Our high player retention numbers put us in the top 75% of all games (not just metaverse games). Many of our top players have been playing WonderMine for over two years.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWonderMine is a social hub, but the gameplay is entirely single-player. Players only see the meteors that fall in their own instance of the scene. With the next roadmap we want to encourage multiplayer gameplay.\n\nThe first step is to enable shared, synchronized meteors, so everyone can see the same drop. This would make all active players rush over to a single location to get the loot first.\n\n### Shared Meteors\n\nWe want to add complexity to the current meteor system, with new categories and tiered meteors that require different levels to mine, including a few meteors that will require collaboration and multiple people to mine at the same time. These meteors will be full of juicy loot! Encouraging players to rush over to these new meteors adds a level of competition to the gameplay, and also requires teamwork to get the loot.\n\nPlayers will still see their own meteors fall at a similar rate. But sometimes a larger, special meteor will drop at the same location for everyone in the scene. The special meteor will require at least 10 players to mine it before it breaks open. Then all 10 players will receive a better-than-normal loot drop for their cooperative mining help.\n\nShared meteors add a new level of player cooperation to the game, which should encourage more interaction and socializing among players. It also adds a competitive element, since you have to be one of the first 10 players to get there.\n\nAfter we deliver the first tier of shared meteors, we have ideas for expanding to other specialty meteor tiers with different in-game mechanics to make WonderMine even more fun.\n\n### The Town Square\n\nWe have begun building a new town square which is going to be a central hub in WonderZone. The square is where new players will spawn and get introduced to WonderZone and all of our games. A place for players to socialize, trade, craft and quest.\n\nWe also want to create a venue with a big screen and stage near WonderMine for hosting events in WonderZone Park. This lets us pursue enhanced collaborations with other Decentraland projects and outside musical artists who can help attract new players. Our strength is in retaining players once they engage with our game. If we can attract new players to an event we can keep many of them playing for a long time to come.\n\n![Town Hub](https://wonderzone.io/img/promo/town1.jpg)\n\n### Seasonal Wearables\n\nWe have reorganized our wearable releases to be seasonal. We create up to 10 wearables and release them at the same time in the crafting machine. Each season contains 1 Mythic, 3-6 Legendaries and 3-6 Epics. The total craftable supply is 3k-6k per season. This means there are always wearables available for players to grind for when mining.\n\nWe want to keep being a hub for new players to socialize and craft their first NFTs for free. Bi-monthly seasonal wearable releases will ensure there are always new wearables for our players.\n\nWe recently introduced Seasonal Airdrop Pass NFTs for players who want to collect all of the wearables in a season. The Airdrop Passes for Season 1 cost 0.3 ETH each and sold out in about 30 minutes. Airdrop pass holders get all the wearables in a seasonal collection. We only sell 10 passes per season and it's the only way to get the seasonal mythic wearable.\n\nNearly all of our wearables can be crafted for free. Airdrop pass revenues are a small fraction of the cost to create the wearables, but it’s a step in the right direction of becoming a sustainable business.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe core team consists of four people with different experience and expertise. Our collaborative experience includes front and back-end software development, game design and game development, character design and all aspects of 3D modeling. Experience aside, we’re a group of passionate game enthusiasts, and have been working on WonderZone next to our full-time jobs prior to receiving funding.\n\n*   Rob Dixon (**Radix**), Co-founder, lead developer\n*   **Chestnutbruze**, Co-founder, 3D artist\n*   **Lew**, Co-founder, 3D artist\n*   **maruudn**, Community manager and game developer\n\nIn addition to the core team, we also have an additional 3D modeler that has designed some of our most iconic wearables, such as the Steampunk outfit, plus an extra back-end developer that works part time to ensure things are running smoothly behind the scenes.\n\n*   Maricela Perdomo (**Maricela**), 3D artist\n*   **Kim G.**, Back-end developer and Azure expert\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### Milestones\n\n*   Shared meteors\n*   Stretch goal: More shared meteor tiers, rarer meteors with more valuable materials\n*   3 bi-monthly seasonal wearables drops (30+ wearables)\n*   New NFT Pickaxes\n*   Town Square and updated park layout\n*   Enhance WonderMine scene for events (add big screen and music streaming)\n*   Allow CoinCart purchases using Polygon Mana\n\n### Budget breakdown\n\n*   Server costs: 5,100 USD\n*   Software licenses: 2,680 USD\n*   Wearables submission fees: 4,500 USD\n*   Developers: 46,800 USD\n*   3D Artists: 43,200 USD\n*   Community management & support: 14,400 USD\n*   Cushion/Contingency: 3,320 USD\n\nTotal: 120,000 USD\n\n### Sustainability\n\nWe aren’t profitable yet. Our overhead is significantly higher than our revenue. We address this with WonderCoin sales and the recently introduced Seasonal Airdrop Passes, and refactoring server code to reduce costs. It will take more time to become a sustainable business.\n\nIn recent months, we have been able to increase our wearables production, thanks to the DAO grant letting some of us go full-time. We need new wearables and NFT Pickaxes to keep WonderMine running. Without DAO funding we can't keep making enough free wearables for our community. Nor could we add new features to the game, since ongoing maintenance and event support requires all the part-time resources we have.\n\nPlease support us to keep WonderMine moving forward and attracting new players, and to help us build a sustainable game within Decentraland.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=41414f10-7d9d-11ed-8277-090458848306)**",

    "title": "DAO Grant Program - Accountability Committee",
    "body": "> by 0x858343382132b9ab46c857a7d52fdbafc039f784 (Zino)\n\n## Linked Draft Proposal\n[Framework for New Committee who decides when to revoke grants -Updated proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ced918f0-6b85-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis Governance proposal aims to create the structure and guidelines for the Accountability Committee\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Accountability Committee will have the sole responsibility to order the revocation of a Grant provided by the Decentraland DAO.\nThis Committee is important to decentralize the decision-making process of determining which grants should be revoked and to take care of the DAO treasury. The path to revoke a vesting contract would be the following:\n\n1.  Any Community Member has the possibility to submit a request through a [form](https://forms.gle/UGF1wj9ueHzvWGPN8) to initiate the revision of a case whenever the grantee is suspected of not complying with the terms and conditions and the Grants Framework.\n2.  The Grant Support Squad will request the grantee to respond to the concerns raised and if the concerns continue, they will send the arguments for the Accountability Committee to evaluate the case. This triggers a preventive revocation or a pause to the Vesting Contract.\n3.  The Accountability Committee will study each case and will have the opportunity to request extra information regarding the case presented, and has the responsibility to provide a resolution to the community, which may be to revoke a Grant vesting contract as a final action; to resume a Grant vesting contract of a previously revoked or paused contract no older than six months; to revoke and create again the Grant vesting contract with a new proposed schedule.\n4.  Any of the outcomes will be executed by the DAO committee.\n\nThe Accountability Committee will be constituted by 5 members and 2 substitutes. This committee selected by the Decentraland DAO Community is expected to be in office for twelve (12) months and the members could be re-elected only for one consecutive period.\nEach committee member will be compensated with 200 USD in MANA per Grant case analyzed,  paid by the DAO treasury and executed by the DAO committee once the verdict has been posted on the Grant Proposal page\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis Accountability Committee would give an opportunity to the grantees to argue with an objective third party not involved in the “revocation process” and would mitigate the “centralized power” of the DAO Committee to judge the case, and execute the decision.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nHere is [the complete framework document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VPb33QdeFlg-qnmclWZF2Ll\\_3USLUnFO/view?usp=sharing). Below, you may find its main points:\n\n**Initial setup of the Committee:**\n\n1.  There will be an open application period in the forum (like the community [has done](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-for-delegates-apply-now/5840) in the past and is doing with the [new DAO Committee member](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569)). Applications will be submitted by the prospects as posts on the forum and applicants should answer the questions mentioned on the complete framework.\n\n2.  The Grant Support Squad interviews the candidates and makes a final selection of 5 members and 2 substitutes. **For the creation of this committee and its renewals**, the final selection will be presented to the community in a poll.\n\n3.  There will be a final poll for the community to vote to accept or decline this selection. This process will be repeated when the committee is renewed.\n\n**Adding a new member:**\nOnce this committee is created, the process for adding a new committee member if there is a vacancy will include these 3 stages:\n\n1.  An Open Call is published in the forum in charge of the Grant Support Squad,\n2.  The committee in office interviews the candidates for the vacant position and makes a final selection of the potential member from the applicants,\n3.  and the community votes in a poll for the best fit.\n\n**To remove a member:**\n\nFollowing the DAO Committee framework, the DAO should add a REMOVE COMMITTEE MEMBER proposal category with the required parameters mentioned [in the complete framework document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VPb33QdeFlg-qnmclWZF2Ll\\_3USLUnFO/view?usp=sharing).\n\n*   A member could be removed by an Internal decision of the Committee members.\n*   A member could be removed by the community creating a proposal, and a simple majority vote would be needed to make it effective.\n\n**Procedure**\n\n*   The Accountability Committee starts to act when there is a formal request from any community member through a [form](https://forms.gle/UGF1wj9ueHzvWGPN8). The Grant Support Squad will request the grantee to respond to the concerns raised within 4 days.\n*   After that, The Grant Support Squad will send, in the course of 4 days, the arguments for the Accountability Committee to evaluate the case. This triggers a preventive revocation or a pause to the Vesting Contract, later to be executed by the DAO committee.\n*   Then, the Accountability Committee has 6 days to discuss the case among the 5 members.\n*   During the period of 6 days, the Accountability Committee has the ability to request further information to the Grant Support Squad or the Grantee about the case presented, not exceeding 30 days. After that, the Accountability Committee has 5 days to publish the final resolution.\n\n**Conflicts of interest.**\n\nAny member of the Accountability Committee should be prevented from participating in a case according to the cases that are mentioned in the [complete framework document - art. 7](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VPb33QdeFlg-qnmclWZF2Ll\\_3USLUnFO/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Execution**\n\n*   The Accountability Committee will reach the final decision by a simple majority.\n*   The final decision of the Accountability Committee should be clear and public on the grant’s page and the grant’s discord channel. This will contain the committee’s arguments.\n\n\n## Impacts\n\n1.  Taking care of the DAO treasury (measured in money recovered to the DAO treasury).\n2.  Decentralizing decision-making of Grant revocations (from 2 actors to 3 actors).\n3.  Diversifying and deepening governance involvement of DAO community into Committees (specific spaces for debate concrete grant cases, with compensations to attract and maintain actors who are acquiring new levels of responsibility for their time invested in the DAO)\n\n\n## Implementation Pathways\n\n1.  Open application period in the forum (like the community has done in the past [here](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-for-delegates-apply-now/5840) and [here](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/open-call-new-dao-committee-member/16569)),\n\n2.  The Grant Support Squad interviews the candidates and makes a final selection of 5 members and 2 substitutes\n\n3\\)The Grant Support Squad will publish a final poll for the community to accept or decline this selection.\n\n4.  The Grants Support Squad will ask the Accountability Committee Members their wallet addresses, and ask the dApp governance squad to create a specific token to vote on the newly created Snapshot Space.\n\n5.  The Grants Support Squad will publish the Accountability Committee framework with its members in the DAO documentation.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis Governance proposal will bring light into the revocation process, clarity to those involved in it, and opportunity for community members to participate in decisions regarding ongoing projects funded by the DAO. It also gives a fair chance for the grantees to provide their arguments to an objective third party not involved in the aforementioned process, and last but not least, it will lessen the “centralized power” of the DAO Committee to judge the case, and execute the decision.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ce104d00-7d94-11ed-8456-a323c09ee17e)**",

    "title": "Bidding and Tendering Flow",
    "body": "> by 0xd11a019a70986bd607cbc1c1f9ae221c78581f49 (Yemel)\n\n## Linked Pre-Proposal\n[Should the DAO implement a Bidding and Tendering process to allocate resources for voted projects?](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=ce730570-6053-11ed-bf97-7dbf9f54c71d)\n\n## Summary\n\nA process for the DAO to agree and allocate resources to strategic projects, make a public call for bids, and later decide on the best provider for the job.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis is not a replacement for the Grant Program, but instead a process to incubate and generate competing grant requests for a previously defined project.\n\nThe Tendering process should be implemented as a new proposal flow, similar to the governance process. It starts with a basic community signaling about the project, and later formalizes the requirements in a Tender Proposal. Once approved, bids for the project will be received over a period of time and the winner is decided by a community vote.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAn important goal is to enable any member of the community to propose a project without the requirement of being the main executor of it.\n\nThe process starts with building consensus around the end goal of the project by using a customer-centric approach. The initial *Pitch Proposal* should address questions about the target customer, and the problem it solves, and any doubts about how it should work. Here, the audience of the proposal is the customer that will use the product.\n\nThe second step is to escalate the project idea into a *Tender Proposal*, including any project requirements, stakeholders, and details about the public tender. The co-authors of the proposal should include representatives of the stakeholder groups signaling their support. Here, the audience of the proposal is a company or freelancer that might submit a bid to build the project.\n\nThe process aims to generate more business opportunities for studios and freelancers looking to work for the DAO. Many talented teams are eager to work but lack the context of what needs to be done.\n\nFinally, this process allows the DAO to allocate its budget in a transparent and efficient manner, by allowing the community to compare offers and vote for the most suitable one.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proposal Flow\n\nA new flow of proposal categories should be added to the Governance dApp.\n\n**1. Pitch Proposal**\n\n*   Any member of the community can send a pitch proposal to test community sentiment.\n*   The proposal should include a product’s name, intended customer, the problem the product solves, benefits to the customer, a call to action telling the customer how to take advantage of the product right away, a FAQ answering the business or tactical questions about building the product.\n*   Duration 10 days and 2M VP threshold.\n*   Minimum required VP to submit a pitch proposal: 100 VP.\n\n**2. Tender Proposal**\n\n*   Passed Pitch Proposals can be promoted to Tender Proposals by any community member.\n*   The proposal should include a summary, specification, deliverables, deadlines, required skills, stakeholders, and any bidding submission details.\n*   Duration 14 days and 4M VP threshold.\n*   Minimum required VP to submit a tender proposal: 2,500 VP.\n\n**3. Bid Proposal**\n\n*   A passed Tender Proposal opens the bidding process for third parties.\n*   The bid should include budget, project duration, starting date, deliverables, roadmap, personnel, beneficiary address, and email address.\n*   Bid details will be kept confidential by the governance app until the submission period is over.\n*   The bidding period should last *at least* 2 weeks.\n\n**4. Selection Proposal**\n\n*   All bids received will be revealed at the same time and put up for a community vote for 2 weeks. Each bid will need to collect at least the VP threshold of the requested budget to be considered passed.\n*   The passed bid with VP simple majority will be considered the winner. The voting process should implement Snapshot’s  [ranked or weighted voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types#ranked-choice-voting-instant-runoff-voting).\n\n### Guidelines\n\nThe following articles should be included in Decentraland’s documentation for future reference.\n\n1.  Placing a bid implies acceptance of an offer in its entirety, including all of its requirements. If the bid is selected, upon initial payment or initial work of the bid, all elements are considered met to consider this a binding contract.\n\n2.  Studios or freelancers may formulate proposals individually or in the form of a partnership as long as they fulfill all requirements and must be included as co-authors and personnel.\n\n3.  The economic proposal must be presented in USD dollars. It will be paid in stablecoins using the vesting contract subject to the conditions of the Grants Program.\n\n4.  Bid proposals that do not cover the full project will be rejected.\n\n5.  Deliveries should be in the form and within the deadlines expressed in the Tender Document, otherwise bids will be rejected.\n\n6.  The community may ask the bidders on the grant proposals to provide complementary information about the company or the proposed solution.\n\n7.  The winning bid will be converted into an enacted grant, following the same policies that govern the Grant’s Program.\n\n8.  In the event that there’s only one valid bid available, a second call should be made. At least two options should be available to decide.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Bidding and Tendering process is a method to select the most suitable service provider or supplier, by comparing proposals against specific criteria. This system encourages fairness and transparency of opportunities, as well as the effectiveness of funds allocation.\n\nThe proposed Bidding and Tendering approach aim to separate the process of deciding *what needs to be done*, from the decision of *who should make it happen*.\nThe Pitch and FAQ it’s a good method to align the community on the final goal of the project, it can be the guide during the development process and the final success evaluation.\n\nIn order to have an effective bidding process it’s important to get many competitive offers from different suppliers. This will require an active effort from the community and DAO core units to make sure the Tender Proposal reaches as many studios as possible.\n\nThe Grant Program and the Tender and Bidding system will coexist, the first being the foundational layer for the second one. Eventually, the community will form some sort of criteria regarding which projects should go directly to the Grant Program and which ones deserve to go through the Tender and Bidding process.\n\nThe proposed scheme aims to be the minimum viable framework to test this idea. Future improvements might involve incentivizing stakeholders to craft tender proposals and oversight the progress of the project. Also delegating to a committee the decision of which bid is the winner might be more effective than a community vote. But for this stage, it’s better to start simple and iterate later using real-world experience.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=a44efb60-7d62-11ed-8456-a323c09ee17e)**",

    "title": "Cooky Cafe Simulator - Development and Expansion",
    "body": "> by 0x3b5ab003f93273b64b9766991896c24fe4423229\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nCooky is a cafe simulator game on DCL where players run their cafes by serving food orders to customer NPCs and earning Cooky coins. Users can reinvest the coins to improve their cafe by buying different in-game assets such as wearables, consumable items, food machines, robot helpers, etc.\n\nAll in-game assets are minted as NFTs and can be freely traded in any NFT marketplace. The game is hosted on 3x2 land parcels [(-45,106)](https://play.decentraland.org/?NETWORK=mainnet\\&position=-45,106). Our mission with Cooky is to build an open ecosystem that allows users to create their own custom cafes and invite other players to visit and contribute to the success of their cafes.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x3B5ab003f93273B64b9766991896C24fe4423229\n\n## Email address\n\nprakhar@indieverse.studio\n\n## Description\n\nCooky is a first-of-its-kind, free-to-play and play-to-earn cafe simulator game on DCL where players fulfil food orders generated by NPCs and earn Cooky coins in return.\n\n### Gameplay\n\nIn the current version, all players have 3 machines in their cafe, namely Pizza Oven, Burger Maker, and Soda Vending machine. Players are required to input “Raw Material” into these machines to make the final product. Currently, there is a standard “Raw Material” stack that is free of cost and can be used on any of the machines.\nOnce the raw material is equipped, machines take a few seconds to prepare their respective food items. Users can pick up these items and deliver them to NPCs on their tables to complete their orders. Once the order is completed, NPCs leave Cooky coins on their tables which once collected are added to the player's coin counter. Players can reinvest their Cooky coins to buy in-game assets from the Cooky marketplace and improve their earnings.\nThe success of one’s cafe can be measured by the “Popularity Index” which depends on the number of orders the cafe has fulfilled up until now.\n\n### Long-Term Vision\n\nWe want to build an ecosystem that allows players to create their own custom cafe on the metaverse and invite peers to visit and contribute to the success of their cafe. We will build in-game assets including different food machines, wearables with in-game benefits, customizable table-chair sets, and robots that will help you cater to customers. Players can buy these items using MANA or Cooky coins and equip them in their cafe. We will also launch a bunch of consumable items with temporary in-game benefits.\n\nAlong with the diverse in-game assets, we also want to build a co-op mode where players can share their resources and earnings and run a single cafe. Players will have different roles and the cafe’s profits will be divided based on those roles.\n\nBelow are the gameplay elements of the game:\n\n### Food Machines\n\n*   Currently, there are 3 food machines: Pizza Oven, Burger Maker and Vending Machine\n*   Each machine have a 1:1 ratio of Raw Material input and Food item output.\n*   In the future, we will launch many more food machines and allow users to buy them from the in-game marketplace\n*   Users will be able to place new machines and change the location of existing machines\n*   Machines will also be upgradeable. Upgrades will increase the cost of its food item, holding capacity and it's speed.\n\n### Table-Chair sets\n\n*   Currently, there are 4 tables by default. Each table can accommodate a maximum of 4 NPCs\n*   In the future, players will be able to buy more table-chair sets and place them in their cafe, thus improving the capacity of their cafe\n*   We will also provide table-chair sets with different designs and capacities (4,6,8 NPCs per table)\n\n### Wearables and Consumables\n\n*   Currently, we have 2 DCL wearables, a Junior Chef, and a Deputy Chef\n*   Deputy Chef , when equipped, increases the overall earnings by 10%\n*   We'll soon launch Good Luck Cat consumable which increases the inflow of NPCs to the cafe for 5 minutes\n*   We will launch more wearables/consumables with benefits such as increased tray capacity, faster movement speed, increased inflow of NPC, etc\n\n### Robot Helpers\n\n*   Robot/NPC helpers will be added in the upcoming updates.\n*   They will help in serving prepared food items to the NPCs and in equipping raw materials for the food machines\n\nPlease note that all the above in-game assets will be minted as ERC-721 NFTs on the Polygon chain\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo take Cooky to the next level and create the features mentioned above we will need to work on it full-time with a team of developers and designers. During this first phase of expansion, we will also do experiments on revenue generation to make the Cooky ecosystem self-sustainable.\n\n### Tech Stack\n\n### Blockchain and Smart Contracts\n\n*   Hardhat\n*   Solidity\n*   Infura as provider\n*   Web3.py\n\n### Frontend and Design\n\n*   DCL SDK 6 + Typescript\n*   ecs-scene-utils library\n*   ui-utils library\n*   Blender\n*   Photoshop/Photopea\n\n### Backend and Database\n\n*   Python\n*   FastAPI backend\n*   AWS Lambda\n*   AWS API Gateway\n*   AWS SAM\n*   MongoDB\n\n### Others\n\n*   Github for code versioning\n*   Github Actions for CI/CD\n*   Whimsical/Lucidchart for flow diagramming + mockups\n*   Discord for communication + Discord bots for internal usage stats alerts\n\n### Milestones Achieved:\n\n*   Launched on **9 Nov 2022**\n*   Total unique registered users till now: **579**\n*   Total Cooky Coins earned till now: **505268**\n*   Growth of [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z9aWgSrP) community to **90** members\n*   Growth of [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CookyP2e) community to **149** followers\n*   Launched the leaderboard based on community feedback on **21 Nov 2022**\n*   First wearable airdrop on **30 Nov 2022** to 10 lucky winners\n*   Launched in-game marketplace with 2 Decentraland wearables on **13 Dec 2022**\n\n### How it helps the DCL community\n\n*   Inflow of new users on DCL to play a cafe simulator game\n*   Till now we have seen good stickiness on the game, which will result in more time spend and better retention of current and upcoming users on DCL\n*   Players will be able to design and launch their own Cafe.

As a team of game developers and designers, we are looking forward to building casual games on DCL and taking the ecosystem forward. Until now we have been working with B2B clients to bring them to DCL. We created employee onboarding portals, retail showrooms, mini-games, etc. for our clients on DCL. Checkout our projects [here](https://www.indieverse.studio/projects). But building games has always been our passion and we love to build for this community. We support decentralized economics in games and the decentralized internet, particularly the decentralized metaverse. We aim to build many more casual games with high-level gameplay, a strong economy, and reward mechanics on DCL.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### Roadmap\n\n### Q1 \\[JANUARY - MARCH]\n\n*   Shifting Cooky Cafe to a larger LAND Parcel\n*   Release 4 more Wearables with different in-game effects\n*   Release 3 consumable items, on top of the 1 already launched, with different in-game effects\n*   Release a Table-Chair set which can be bought from the Cooky Marketplace and can be placed on the reserved spot for table\n*   Release 3 more Food Machines which can be bought from the Cooky Marketplace, with the option to place them on reserved spots\n*   Bi-Weekly Cooking Parties on a relevant theme at the time\n\n### Q2 \\[APRIL - JUNE]\n\n*   Release 4 more Wearables with different in-game effects\n*   Food Machine upgrade NFTs which will modify the machines and make them unique.\n*   High-quality raw material launch on Cooky Marketplace\n*   Bi-Weekly Cooking Parties on a relevant theme at the time\n*   Launch of ERC-20 token for Cooky coin with withdrawal functionality in the marketplace\n*   Release of first-generation Robot Helpers.

    "body": "> by 0xe793376ad5357ccce8cd0f8c8be012464648f8f3 (Atoza)\n\nShould the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe metaverse holds massive potential to bridge people from all over the world. AsiaVerse is building a platform to showcase and celebrate cultures and businesses from all over Asia in Decentraland.\n\nAsiaVerse is well-connected to many web3 and NFT ecosystems in Asia, with these relationships building for more than a year. This is a huge value-add to the Decentraland ecosystem, affirmed by the metaverse track record that we have accomplished so far.\n\nThrough a focus on film and education, AsiaVerse will onboard film studios and universities into Decentraland from various parts of Asia, eventually leading up to pan-Asia film and education festivals that will serve to onboard many people in Asia into Decentraland.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n60,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2aF63A7210438dB1F21b459038181fB78e56c647\n\n## Email address\n\nasiaverseworld@gmail.com\n\n## Description\n\n*   According to a report from law firm Gowling WLG, 83% from China are interested in participating in the metaverse, twice that of the UK (37%).\n    (https://workplaceinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IG00135\\_Gowling_Metaverse_ESG_Report_FINAL7333166-compressed.pdf)\n\n*   South Korea is also leading the way, as the government has started to plan for a metaverse future through its multi-billion dollar budget.\n    (https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/09/10/asia-pacific/south-korea-metaverse/)\n\n*   A Hootsuite report also highlights four countries in Southeast Asia as part of the top 10 countries that spend the most time per day using the internet, underscoring the potential for people in these countries to transition into metaverses eventually.\n    (https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-youth-in-south-east-asia-2021 )\n\nThese are some of the many signs that show immense growth potential for the metaverse industry in Asia, heavily supported by the digital-savvy consumers and strongly connected digital infrastructure in the region.\n\nHowever, the diversity of the cultures and languages in Asia makes the region hard to penetrate. AsiaVerse is very well-positioned through the web3 relationships it has built in Asia for over a year, supported by the founder’s extensive experience living across the entire continent in the past decade.\n\nAsiaVerse has a strong track record building in the metaverse, establishing unique partnerships and hosting impactful metaverse events despite only having a volunteer team.\n\nThese are some of the major metaverse accomplishments this year (as documented on our Twitter page @AsiaVerseWorld):\n\n*   Jan to May 2022: Monthly art exhibitions featuring joint participation from Japan, Korea, China, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia (Pre-DCL)\n\n1.  One of these events led to the successful sell-out of the Japanese NFT collection, Kawaii Skulls, after having no sales for many months\n2.  Featured multiple top artists including Mr Misang (Korea), who was recognized as one of the top 3 highest selling artists on SuperRare last year, and Lickpalik (Indonesia), a pop cultural icon whose comics are read by most Indonesians\n\n*   Mar 2022: Asia Sings with Ukraine charity music concert, raised ~10 ETH (about $30,000) from numerous NFT collections all over Asia (Pre-DCL)\n\n*   May 2022: Collaboration with Japan Philharmonic Orchestra (est. 1956), Japan's first symphony orchestra, to screen their ticketed performance LIVE (Pre-DCL)\n\n*   May 2022: 14 unique pop-up experiences based on various popular NFT collections globally and in Asia (CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, CloneX, Azuki, MoonBirds, World of Woman, Doodles, Karafuru, Supernormal, 8sian, Phantabear, Neo Tokyo, CyberKongz, Cool Cats)\n\n*   Aug 2022: Decentraland Art Week, featuring architecture and NFT collections from Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines\n\n*   Oct 2022: DigitX in Decentraland, partnered with De La Salle University, one of the top 3 universities in the Philippines; over 300 students participated in the online lecture sessions\n\n*   Dec 2022: Poetry showcase featuring student work from Wenzao Ursuline University of Languages – the top language university in Taiwan\n\nUpcoming:\n\n*   Film metaverse build in partnership with Ever Rolling Films from Vietnam, based on their short film Roommate that premiered in Cannes Festival in 2018\n*   Asia Ape Hub to feature Bored Ape Yacht Club holders from Asia building in Web3, to offer more exposure for Decentraland across other web3 niches\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe grant will cover three main aspects:\n\n*   Metaverse Development Architects: Design & Building ($5,000+ / month)\n*   Partnership Specialists: Business Development & Partnerships ($2,000+ / month)\n*   Marketing & Hybrid Events Specialists (In real life + metaverse) ($500+ / month)\n*   Buffer costs ($500+ / month)\n*   TOTAL: $8,000+ / month\n\nAs the bulk of the work will be metaverse development, for the purpose of estimating salary estimates, we can assume the following team composition:\n4x Metaverse Development Architects (2 Japan, 2 Philippines), 2x Partnership Specialists, 1x Marketing (Online & Events) Specialist\n\n1.  Metaverse Development Architect:\n    According to CryptoJobsList, the average Metaverse Architect makes an average of $55K / year, or $4.6K / month.\n\nAssuming this is based on the US and if we adjust for Purchasing Price Parity or PPP (differences in cost of living), this will be $3.4K / month in Japan and $1.6K / month in the Philippines. Based on the above architect count, 2 x $3.4K + 2x $1.6K = $10K / month.\n\nAt least one architect is committed to building full-time (Munakata), but to be conservative we halve the estimates to $5K / month.\n\nCryptoJobsList Data: https://cryptojobslist.com/salaries/metaverse-architect-salary (as of Dec 15, 2022)\n\nPPP Calculator: https://www.chrislross.com/PPPConverter/ (as of Dec 15, 2022)\n\n2.  Partnership Specialists:\n    Because our coverage is the entire Asia continent, there will be times where we have to travel. We assume $500 / month for travel and $1500 / month for salary each, for a total of $4K per month for two people.\n\nAgain, to be conservative we halve this amount to $2K / month.\n\nAs the goal is to build for a variety of entities in the film and education sector, the partnership specialist role is essential.\n\n3.  Marketing & Hybrid Events Specialist (In real life + metaverse):\n    To enhance the experiences and results, on occasion we may need funds for marketing and hybrid events to maximize activation rates, or depending on the needs of the entities we are partnering with. We budget $500 / month for this expense.\n\n4.  Buffer:\n    We budget $500 / month as a buffer.\n\nTotal budget estimated to be $8K / month.\n\nBased on the above budget, this will give us a development runway of 7.5 months (based on conservative estimates) or less.\n\nOver a period of 10 months, AsiaVerse aims to achieve the goals of having at least 1 large-scale film event and 1 large-scale university event, involving a total of 8 to 12 major entities from all over Asia (as above).\n\nIn reality, as the grant will only cover part of the total calculated expenses, the team will most likely take in less than that. The team will continue to build, driven by our passion to build our metaverse portfolio for the long-term and to connect Asia with the world, as we have done in 2022.\n\nWith what AsiaVerse has achieved so far with only volunteers and personal financial contributions, we are certain that we can achieve a lot more with the grant to support our efforts to expand metaverse participation and development throughout Asia, bridging East and West to drive substantial cultural and business value in a truly decentralized metaverse. AsiaVerse will be one of the major pioneers in the onboarding of people across Asia to Decentraland, striving hard to maximize metaverse potential throughout the continent.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe team is decentralized geographically, composed of passionate metaverse enthusiasts with complementary skills.\n\nPan-Asian Team led by Apesian Atoza, Founder (Business Development, Partnerships)\n\n*   Apesian entered the NFT and metaverse space in early 2021, joining Last Slice and established a strong presence on web3 with over 30K followers on Twitter. He has built a strong network across Asia, living in many countries in the region for over a decade. He is also fluent in cultures and languages in Asia, a rare and valuable experience in the metaverse space. (@theNFTAsian)\n\nPhilippines Team led by Meg Amat (Metaverse Design & Development, Hybrid Events Organization, Partnerships)\n\n*   Meg has extensive experience organizing live events for many multinational firms in industries such as tech, financial services and luxury. She knows how to create meaningful experiences and has been contributing her creative skills and extensive networks to the metaverse. (@Meg_Amat)\n\nJapan Team led by Munakata (Metaverse Development)\n\n*   Munakata has a background in science and technology and is an avid metaverse user. He is the chief architect of the experiences that we have built in the past. (@munakata_nft)\n\n*   Marimo (@marimodesign)\n\nVietnam Team led by Hung Le (Marketing, Partnerships)\n\n*   Hung is part of Ever Rolling Films, which produced highly acclaimed film works. He aspires to create new experiences and possibilities at the intersection of film and metaverse. (@hungle1860)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nAsiaVerse envisions more events that involve multiple countries across Asia, focusing on film and education. Film enthusiasts and students will interact with those from other countries in Asia interactively, learning from each other like never before.\n\nThere will be three development phases, for a total of at least 7 metaverse projects:\n\n*   Phase 1: Individual Experiences (Jan-Feb 23) - 3 events\n\nWe have been cultivating relationships with film professionals and educators in East Asia and Southeast Asia and seek to build trust with top-class film studios and universities in these regions by building unique experiences and architecture.\n\n*   Phase 2: Small-scale Exchanges (Mar-May 23) - 2 events\n\nIn the next phase, we focus on simultaneous partnerships with several film studios or universities to promote exchanges between 2-3 entities. This will be similar to our DCL Art Week experience, where we featured architecture and art from three different countries.\n\n*   Phase 3: Large-scale Festivals (Jun-Oct 23) - 2 events\n\nIn the last phase, we will combine all our major partners in the film and education sectors to create large-scale exchange experiences. AsiaVerse will become known as a connector, creating new value in these sectors through the metaverse.\n\nThe main goal of this grant is for us to gain strong credibility in the film and education space by launching the first pan-Asian metaverse film festival experience and the first pan-Asian university exchange among students.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=d6d454b0-7d3d-11ed-b135-498029192bca)**",

    "title": "Build a new DAO Squad to work on Decentraland's Protocol",
    "body": "> by 0xffac7fd045303112fdb28e9dace8e1334ad324c0 (eordano)\n\nShould the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nDecentraland has always favored a vision of collective ownership, relying on peer-to-peer networks and open-source development. But for a truly decentralized platform that stands the test of time, the technical knowledge and expertise required to build using this protocol needs to be distributed.\n\nThe main experience, the World Explorer, is a large and complex piece of software that currently has only one practical implementation: the official one.\n\nWe propose the creation of a Protocol Squad, with the mission of fostering awareness and decentralization of the Decentraland protocol. Their first objectives:\n\n1.  Publish an extensive and detailed documentation of the protocol\n2.  Create three alternative implementations of the World Explorer\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x968fF0B6911E5571C2bB933383EFC089ED1ABfC7\n\n## Email address\n\nesteban@decentraland.org\n\n## Description\n\nThe Protocol Squad has two objectives:\n\n1.  Publish an extensive and detailed documentation of the Decentraland protocol\n2.  Create alternative implementations of the World Explorer\n\nSee [Proposal: a Protocol Squad for the DAO](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/proposal-a-protocol-squad-for-the-dao/17000) for an early discussion of this initiative.\n\n### Documenting the Protocol\n\nHaving a well-known public protocol is central to the promise of Decentraland, meant to throw open the doors of participation to developers all around the world — but the lack of an authoritative resource that details the what, how, and why of each component is a major obstacle for people wanting to jump in.\n\nWe must be ambitious. High-quality documentation (like Mozilla's MDN) goes beyond technical specification and actually helps in writing solid code that works reliably and avoids common pitfalls. It’s alive, up-to-date with recent developments, aligned with current practice and responsive to feedback from readers.\n\nThis documentation must:\n\n*   Provide a high-level overview of the protocol and all its components\n*   Maintain an up-to-date specification of the most important APIs and components\n*   Guide implementers towards good architectural decisions and away from pitfalls\n*   Address common misunderstandings that tend to arise during development\n*   Help readers navigate transitions from deprecated methods to newer variants\n*   Welcome feedback from readers so they can point out problems and offer suggestions\n\n### Implementing Alternative Explorers\n\nThe World Explorer is the principal client of the Decentraland protocol, by virtue of using the entire set of features and introducing requirements that drive the development of the underlying software.\n\nWe’ll build three new implementations that rely on different frameworks and utilities, and can tackle these problems from a fresh start taking new approaches while armed with the accumulated lessons and discoveries of the Foundation.\n\n[Click here to read about the rationale and criteria used for each implementation](https://dcl-dao.notion.site/Criterions-for-Engine-Selection-e55f8ea382f94ff0943bce383b7c7816), a [comparison of engines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15NOnGhBiVaZk4gTeW-Gmd7cWUdmf1\\_6PeUUPVTM5WtY/edit#gid=0) and how well do they fit with each criteria, and [join the discussion about the Protocol Squad](https://forum.decentraland.org/t/proposal-a-protocol-squad-for-the-dao/17000) on the forum.\n\nThe protocol documentation will be tested and refined as these efforts progress.\n\nThe three implementations have different goals:\n\n1.  **Short-term, production-ready** (Unity): aiming to become the most popular among players, this implementation would prioritize enhanced performance, distribution on game and app stores, broad reach for developers, and attention to legal licensing in today's market.\n\n2.  **Educational** (BabylonJS): new developers joining the Decentraland community can greatly benefit from an implementation that prioritizes readability and organization, easy addition of new features, widely known programming languages and simple tooling. This implementation is meant for humans to read, learn and discuss improvements to the protocol.\n\n3.  **Moonshot** (Bevy): an idealistic and forward-looking implementation, based on technologies that are currently immature but hold great promise for the future. This project would prioritize solid fundamentals, extensibility, and the use of modern open-source frameworks.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Protocol Squad is a new DAO group focused on the technical protocols underlying the Decentraland experiences and products.\n\n### Tools\n\n*   We will join the other DAO squads and use their Notion to coordinate our work.\n*   We will publish materials we create on GitHub and GitLab, under the Decentraland Foundation's organization (if we get their approval) and mirror to our own organization (https://github.com/decentraland-protocol and https://gitlab.com/decentraland-protocol).\n*   We'll use the Forum and Discord to communicate updates on our progress.\n\n### Current progress\n\nWe've already been working on this, funded out of our own pockets. We've already:\n\n*   Analyzed which [engines to use](https://www.notion.so/dcl-dao/Criterions-for-Engine-Selection-e55f8ea382f94ff0943bce383b7c7816)\n*   Hired Santiago Lezica as Technical Writer\n*   Wrote the beginning of an \"Implementation Guide\"\n*   Wrote Job Descriptions for the missing members of the team\n\n### Use of Funds\n\nThe funds required to hire a 5-person team of world class engineers are way north of the 30,000 USD a month that this grant would provide us. We're looking to match the funds provided by this significant economic effort from the DAO through raising funds from other community members. Send me an email if you'd like to chip in!\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nLeadership:\n\n*   Yemel Jardi and Esteban Ordano (co-authors of the original white paper and active DAO participants)\n\nDocumentation:\n\n*   Santiago Lezica [GitHub](https://github.com/slezica?tab=repositories)\n\nImplementers:\n\n*   Technical Lead\n*   Unity Full Stack Developer ([Job Description](https://dcl-dao.notion.site/Full-Stack-Engineer-Unity-6ce0ef190fba4328aa8a99673624e5d7))\n*   BabylonJS Full Stack Developer ([Job Description](https://dcl-dao.notion.site/Full-Stack-Engineer-BabylonJS-a38e13f6df264fa0ae7f70abc39068e4))\n*   Bevy Full Stack Developer ([Job Description](https://dcl-dao.notion.site/Full-Stack-Engineer-Rust-Bevy-bdee0a1f777e49228ae3a1a60109c301))\n\nWe already have head-hunted a person as a tech lead for the project; but have not started hiring for the lead positions for each implementation. The Technical Lead position will dive down and come out of each implementation ensuring good practices and learnings are shared between the team.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### Stage 1: Build up the team & Lay down the groundwork\n\n*   Scout and hire the three main developers for each implementations\n*   Hire the technical lead to work with the writer on the current code base, and build an implementation guide\n*   ETA: March 1st, 2023\n\n### Stage 2: Onboarding the team\n\n*   Have all developers start on the same date\n*   Go over the protocol, components, implementation guide and architecture\n*   Publish the first edition of a Decentraland Implementation Guide\n*   Expected duration: 2 weeks\n*   ETA: March 15th, 2023\n\n### Stage 3: Implementation, part 1\n\n*   Start the development of working prototypes with:\n    *   Scenes with the SDK\n    *   Avatars with custom wearables and emotes\n    *   Establish communications\n    *   Connect with friends\n    *   Prototype of moving in the world, with minimum features supported\n*   Stretch goal: Full SDK7 Runtime Support\n*   Improve and enrich the Implementation Guide with the design decisions and problems that we find along the way.\n*   ETA: June 1st, 2023\n\nBy this time, we will be asking for another grant:\n\n*   We believe it's not realistic to produce a high quality client for Decentraland in three to four months.\n*   We hope that our steady progress on this will be enough to earn your continued support when we ask for another grant by the middle of the year.\n*   We'll build on the open, and communicate our progress frequently over the forum and Discord.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9303c5e0-7cbb-11ed-b135-498029192bca)**",
