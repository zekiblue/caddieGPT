    "summary": "> by 0xd4f1cab694c4424c4796549edbb9b489789f4df5 (TudaMoon)\n\n### Overview\n\nThis proposal outlines the transition from the current grant system to a bounty-based system, aiming to enhance efficiency and community engagement in achieving project milestones. This would make the goals community driven. Then as a community everyone can work on achieving the goals one milestone at a time. The best part, everyone gets paid upon completion of a milestone and everyone has the same opportunity to complete it.\n\n### Stage 1: Proposal Submission and Bounty Creation\n\n*   **Purpose:** Initiate projects with clearly defined objectives and structured paths to completion.\n*   **Details:**\n    *   Proposals must include:\n        *   **Goals**: The final outcome expected from the project.\n        *   **Milestones**: Specific tasks required to achieve the goal, with associated costs and deadlines for each (up to 3 months total).\n        *   **Technical Requirements**: Detailed specifications for each milestone to ensure clarity and feasibility.\n\n### Role of Technical Auditor\n\n*   **Function**: Works in conjunction with the Grant Support Squad to evaluate the technical sufficiency of milestone submissions.\n*   **Process**:\n    *   Reviews submissions against the milestone's technical requirements.\n    *   Advises the Grant Support Squad on whether submissions meet the set standards.\n\n### Bounty Completion and Rewarding\n\n*   **Participation**: Open to all. Each participant or team can tackle the specified milestones.\n*   **Reward System**:\n    *   Bounties are paid only upon successful completion and approval of a milestone.\n    *   If multiple submissions are received by the deadline, the most suitable one, as determined by the Technical Auditor and Grant Support Squad, is chosen.\n    *   If the deadline is missed, the bounty is awarded to the first team that completes the milestone adequately.\n\n**Note**: This bounty system replaces the old grant system. It is designed to ensure that contributions are not only timely but also meet the expected quality standards, fostering a competitive yet collaborative environment.\n\n### Enacted\n\nIf this proposal is passed, it would update to a bounty based system where all can participate. It would also create a new position for the DAO called Technical Auditor which would work with the Grant Support Squad. All the details above will be enacted.\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Create new Grant Revocation Category for DAO",
    "summary": "> by 0xd4f1cab694c4424c4796549edbb9b489789f4df5 (TudaMoon)\n\n### Problem\n\nCurrently, a grant is passed in 1 round of voting by the DAO. However, if the DAO wants to revoke the grant, it takes 3 rounds of voting through the governance system.\n\n### Solution\n\n### Revocation Category\n\nCreate a category specific for the DAO to revoke grants. This category would require only 1 round of voting to revoke a grant. Once a grant is revoked by the DAO, the grant cannot be reinstated. The author of the proposal to revoke must include a detailed reasoning and evidence.\n\n### Category Requirements\n\n**Voting Period:** 168 hours (7 days).\n**Quorem:** 4 Million VP\n**Submission Threshold:** 1,000 VP\n\n### Repetitive Submissions\n\nOne proposal to revoke a specific grant can only be submitted successfully once per 30 days. This amount of attempts to revoke criteria is only applies to this process and does NOT effect the Grant Support Squad or Revocation Committee process. The revocation proposal CANNOT be submitted by it's own grantee or team member of the grant. If the proposal does not meet Quorem, it does not count as a successful submission to revoke and therefore can be submitted again.\n\n### Passed Revocations\n\nIf the Grant Revocation is successfully passed, it would immediately pause the vesting contract. The Grantee would be deemed ineligible for re-applying for a similar grant in the future. The grantee can apply for a new grant that is different in nature in the future as it does NOT forbid all grants from that grantee.\n\n### Denied Revocations\n\nIf the Grant Revocation proposal successfully meets quorem, but fails to pass the proposal. The grant would continue as usual. No Grant Revocation proposal for that specific grant can be made for another 30 days. The grantee, however cannot use this process as an excuse for shortfalls on their project updates.\n\n### Funds given to Grantee\n\nFunds that are already given out to the grantee, cannot be recovered by the DAO. However, the DAO can require payments to be distributed to non-grant participants.\n\nFor example, if the grant says they plan to reward a prize of $1000 to the winner of a tournament which is specified in the original grant. The grantee must use any funds recieved to pay for the winner of that tournament. *All funds that are not for the grantee and are for users of Decentraland get first priority of payment.*\n\nIf the grantee fails to pay the non-grantee participants after being revoked, they shall be banned from all Discords, Forums and Decentraland related events where possible. If the grantee pays the non-grantee participants, then their bans will be lifted and they will be allowed to return. In the unusual circumstance where the DAO pays the funds to the non-grantee participants of the grant on behalf of the grant, the grantee of that grant must instead pay the DAO back in order for bans to be lifted.\n\n### Additional Clarifications\n\nThis does NOT remove power from the Grant Support Squad or Revocations Committee. This simply gives an alternate option or process for the DAO to revoke grants in a decentralized form.\n\n### Enactment\n\nIf passed, this would create a new process and new voting category for the DAO to be able to revoke grants in a decentralized manner.\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "title": "Amend DAO Governance Proposal Stages",
    "summary": "> by 0xd4f1cab694c4424c4796549edbb9b489789f4df5 (TudaMoon)\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe enacted governance that is to be amended is to be found here: [DAO Governance Proposal Stages](https://decentraland.org/governance/proposal/?id=5193f850-5c00-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174). This proposal would amend the original policy of the passed governance to reflect the following changes. Any conflicts from this proposal and the original enacted governance (referred to above) will be superseded by this proposal.\n\n### Problem\n\nThe original proposal is ideal, however the process takes forever. If Decentraland wants to make changes to policy, it takes a minimum of 26 days to get something enacted. That 26 days only can happen if the next stage of the proposal is immediately submitted directly after the passing of the previous stage. This makes it timely and difficult to pass needed policies or amend policies.\n\nAfterall, most of the time, you hear from people \"The first proposal should pass easily, it's just to move to the next stage.\" All in all that is true, which essentially makes the first stage pointless.\n\n### State of Decentraland\n\nCurrently Decentraland is not very active and seems like it has drastically slowed down. It is important that new policies are made to protect the brand and redirect Decentraland to a more successful path. However, this can take months. Months are almost like years in web3. Web3 moves fast and those who do not keep up, get left behind. We need to decrease the duration of the total time for these governance proposals to stay competitive.\n\n### Solution\n\n### Stage 1: Initial Pitch\n\n**Purpose:** Present the basic concept of the proposal to gauge preliminary community interest.\nContent: Include a concise summary of the proposal’s intent, potential impact, and a brief outline of implementation steps.\n**Voting Period:** 72 hours (3 days).\n**Quorem:** 1 Million VP\n**Submission Threshold:** 1,000 VP\n\n### Stage 2: Detailed Policy Proposal\n\nPurpose: Provide a comprehensive and formally written governance proposal after incorporating feedback from Stage 1. This will be the enacted policy if passed, as it is written in this stage.\n**Voting Period:** 168 hours (7 days).\n**Quorem:** 4 Million VP\n**Submission Threshold:** 1,000 VP\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis amended process should help Decentraland move more swiftly with policy creation and amendments. This also gives the ability to remove bad or poor policy. This amends the original enacted policy (link above). This policy will remove Stage 3 from the governance proposal process. From this point forward, all governance will be passed in 2 stages according to the policy criteria above.\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "summary": "> by 0xd4f1cab694c4424c4796549edbb9b489789f4df5 (TudaMoon)\n\nShould the following $1,400 grant in the Core Unit category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Duel Arena game, a grant-funded game within Decentraland, recently concluded a tournament with promised payouts. Unfortunately, the grant originally allocated for these payouts was revoked, and Injester chose to withhold the funds rather than distribute them to the tournament winners. This has resulted in significant disappointment and distrust among the players, who invested time and effort with the expectation of a fair reward.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n1,400 USD in DAI\n\n  \n## Project duration\n  \n1 month\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xd4f1cAb694c4424C4796549edbb9B489789F4Df5\n\n## Email address\n\nTudamoon@proton.me\n\n## Description\n\nWhile these players not being paid out is no fault of Decentraland, this is an opportunity for Decentraland to do the right thing and make sure that these players got paid. The players who are owed money by Injester had nothing to do with the grant's revocation. Those players were simply supporters of the Duel Arena game. To resolve this issue and restore trust within the community, Decentraland DAO proposes to allocate funds directly to the affected players. This will not only compensate them for their efforts but also reinforce Decentraland's commitment to fair play and integrity.\n\nThis grant will not be a recurring thing if game projects fail or get revoked. Therefore, it should NOT hold as a precedent. This is going to be taken as a lesson learned for everyone that in the future, the responsibility will forever be on the project and the player’s own willingness to take risk.\n\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThis is completely for repayment of the players who participated in Duel Arena's Tournaments and failed to get paid. I hope the funds can be allocated directly to the following wallets with the correct amounts:\n\npaulyong =$175\n0x6aa991C9a995091Cb2d082734B684201ab7163C3\n\nGamer =$1000\n0xe5104e449950180C459447F2971C8A760456B635\n\nKrek5521 =$100\n0x0DA24951ff95603FA424850c732C91CB1159cd44\n\nMiladlasso =$125\n0xA8c9cb3A05b78FE275Fa098DF4C95593acEE62e0\n\nIf these cannot be sent directly from the DAO. I, Tudamoon, pledge to make sure that the correct amount (minus gas fees) is transferred to each wallet.\n\n\n## Milestones\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

    "summary": "> by 0x247e0896706bb09245549e476257a0a1129db418 (LordLike)\n\n**PROBLEM**\n\nThe current curation process in Decentraland lacks balance in the distribution of collections among curators. This imbalance leads to a situation where some curators can earn significantly more while others get little to no work due to not being as fast or not using parsers or bots to get notifications about new collections.\n\nThis demotivates some curators as they are left without work opportunities, leading to an unfair distribution of tasks and rewards.\n\n**POTENTIAL SOLUTION**\n\nTo address this issue, we propose the implementation of an automated curation system that ensures a fair distribution of collections among curators. The key features of this system would include:\n\n*   Automated Assignment: A bot that automatically assigns new collections to curators who have curated fewer items that month. This ensures that work is evenly distributed.\n\n*   Time-Based Reassignment: If a curator does not respond to a collection assignment within a specified time period, the collection is reassigned to the next available curator.\n\n*   Review Limitation: Once a curator has approved a collection with n wearables, they will not be able to review additional wearables until all other curators have had the opportunity to review n wearables each. This prevents any single curator from monopolizing the curation process.\n\n*   Sequential Curation Restriction: Curators should not be able to review more than one collection in a row. This further ensures a balanced distribution of work.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nImplementing an automated curation system with these features will promote fairness, motivate curators, and enhance the overall efficiency of the curation process in Decentraland. By ensuring that collections are evenly distributed, all curators will have equal opportunities to contribute and earn, fostering a more balanced and motivated curation process.\n\n**VOTING OPTIONS**\n\nYES: Restructure Curation Process.\n\nNO: Leave as it is.\n\nThis is a non-binding pre-proposal poll to assess community sentiment. If approved, feedback and insights will be solicited to refine and finalize the points.\n\n- YES\n- NO\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.

The current moderation needs re-evaluation to ensure it effectively manages community interactions and enforces guidelines. This initiative addresses the need for effective moderation to keep up with the evolving community.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nWe propose a community-driven approach to select new moderators for the Discord, Forum, Gov Platform, and DAO Headquarters to manage the Code of Ethics application within the whole DAO ecosystem. This involves a Bidding and Tendering process where members nominate and vote for moderators. The selected moderators will be onboarded, ensuring they are equipped with the necessary permissions and tools to fulfill their duties.\n\n\n## Target Audience/Customer Base\n\nDecentraland and DAO Community\n\n\n## Why is this relevant now?\n\nOpening the moderation role to the community allows for new perspectives and ensures a free-speech environment within voted guidelines.

Lands for Rent Heatmap: Similar to the sale layer, but showing rental prices across the map with a color gradient. Both heatmap layers include a legend on the left with the pricing scale and corresponding colors. When a heatmap is active the background map is now grayscale to allow the color-coded land prices to stand out more vividly.\nTo access the new heatmap layers:\nLands for Sale Heatmap > https://genesis.city/#0,0,2z,n0,e0,c0,p0,s1,r0\n![Lands for Sale Heatmap](https://i.ibb.co/6rVW9Pf/lands-For-Sale-Heatmap.png)\n\nLands for Rent Heatmap > https://genesis.city/#0,0,2z,n0,e0,c0,p0,s0,r1\n![Lands for Rent Heatmap](https://i.ibb.co/GnDrFCC/lands-For-Rent-Heatmap.png)\n\n**Games Layer:**\nWe've added a new Games Layer to Genesis City, making it easy to locate and access all the games available in Decentraland. The Games Layer shows the position of every game on the Genesis City map. Left click on a game's location and you'll jump straight into it.\nTo view the Games Layer:\nGames Layer > https://genesis.city/#0,0,2z,n0,e0,c0,p0,s0,r0,g1\n![Games Layer](https://i.ibb.co/kcS5516/games-Layer.png)\n\n**Art Layer:**\nAllowing you to easily discover and explore all the art venues and galleries within Decentraland. With the Art Layer toggle on, you can see the precise locations of every art spot on the Genesis City map. Simply navigate to an art venue's location, and you'll have the option to jump right in.\nTo view the Art Layer:\nArt Layer > https://genesis.city/#0,0,3z,n0,e0,c0,p0,s0,r0,g0,a1\n![Art Layer](https://i.ibb.co/FgDY4jB/artLayer.png)\n\n**UI Enhancement**\nWe've updated our layer toggle controls, categorizing them for easy navigation.\n![Layer controls](https://i.ibb.co/0mpmdCJ/layer-Controls.png)\n\nFinally, we improved our project's maintenance processes and stability. We paid off some technical debt and fixed bugs.\nWe remain committed to engaging with our community and continue to receive valuable feedback from our users, including requests for new features and improvements.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe will update the map weekly for 6 months.\nIf the proposal is approved, our main focus for the next period will be to generate historical views of Genesis City. Soon, you will be able to select past dates and view the state of Genesis City as it was on those days. This feature will allow you to explore the evolution of Genesis City over time, providing valuable insights and a fascinating look at its development.\n![DCLtimelapse](https://i.ibb.co/0Qbc9WF/600pxezgif-1-7bbaf5f2ac.gif)\n\n**Here are some of the projects in our roadmap:**\n\n*   Historical view of the entire map.\n*   Land ownership layer.\n*   Live users locations.\n*   Display weekly events.\n*   See what's nearby a location (eg. display info of events, POIs, etc).\n*   Street view.\n*   Land rating system.\n*   Isometric views.\n*   Allow users to upload photos of lands.\n*   Staff picks.\n*   Layer showing frequency of land updates.\n*   Percentage of land development (user feedback).\n*   Include missing parts of Aetheria (user feedback).\n*   Search bar.\n*   Bookmarks/favorite destinations.\n*   Content age heatmap.\n*   Display the bus routes.\n*   Monthly/weekly treasure hunt.\n*   Geolocated comments.\n*   Metamask log-in for displaying user-owned lands.\n*   Livestream of virtual cameras from certain points in DCL.\n*   Design tweaks.\n\n**We will continue improving the website and mapping script based on this list and future suggestions by our community.

    "title": "Decentraland DAO Proposal: Introducing Proposal Submission Fees",
    "summary": "> by 0xed0e0cb94f60f72ec94bef848f5df4cbd365af1d (InJesterr)\n\n**Proposal Summary**\n\nWe propose the introduction of a submission fee for certain categories of proposals within the Decentraland DAO. This fee, set at $25 worth of MANA, will be directed to the DAO Treasury. The implementation of this fee will address key issues related to proposal submissions, enhance the value and seriousness of submitted ideas, and contribute to the DAO’s financial health.\n\n***\n\n*   **Enhancing Proposal Quality:** By introducing a submission fee, we aim to filter out less serious or low-quality proposals. The cost will encourage community members to submit well-thought-out and valuable proposals, as they will be investing financially in their ideas.\n\n*   **Supporting the DAO Treasury:** The fees collected will go directly to the DAO Treasury, providing additional funds for various DAO initiatives and projects, thereby strengthening the overall ecosystem.\n\n*   **Reducing Trolls and Overload:** Implementing a fee will help reduce the number of spam or frivolous proposals, making the review process more efficient and focused on genuinely impactful ideas.\n\n***\n\n**Fee Structure and Categories**\nWe propose the following structure for the submission fees:\n\n**Free Categories:**\n\n**Name Ban:** As name bans are typically related to preventing abuse or protecting the community, this category will remain free to ensure accessibility and responsiveness.\n\n**Hiring:** To facilitate the growth and development of the DAO, hiring proposals will be free, encouraging the recruitment of talent without financial barriers.\n\n**Removing Point of Interest**: Removing a point of interest should be free.\n\n**Paid Categories ($25 worth of MANA):**\n\n*   Catalyst Node\n*   Point of Interest\n*   Linked Wearable Registry\n*   Grant Request\n*   Pitch\n*   Special Case - Poll:\n\n**Initial Poll Submission:** Free. Polls & Drafts allow the community to gauge interest and gather initial feedback without financial constraints.\n\n**Polls and Final Poll Stages:** Once a poll passes the initial stage and reaches the Final stage, a $25 fee will be required to proceed. This fee ensures that only serious and well-supported proposals advance through the final stages.\n\n**Expected Outcomes**\n\n*   **Improved Proposal Quality:** With a financial stake involved, proposers are likely to submit more thoughtful and impactful ideas.\n*   **Increased Treasury Funds:** The DAO Treasury will benefit from an additional revenue stream, supporting more projects and initiatives.\n*   **Efficient Proposal Management:** The review process will become more efficient, focusing on high-quality proposals and reducing the administrative burden.\n\n**(Treasury Allocation: All collected fees will be directly transferred to the DAO Treasury.)**\n\n- Yes, I support this idea.\n- Yes, but raise the price.\n- Yes, but lower the price.\n- No, I don't support this idea.\n- Invalid question/options\n\n\n**[This proposal is summarized due to technical limitations.
